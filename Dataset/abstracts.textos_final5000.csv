"Secondary structure elements of many protein families exhibit differential conservation on their opposing faces. Amphipathic helices and beta-sheets by definition possess this property, and play crucial functional roles. This type of evolutionary trajectory of a protein family is usually critical to the functions of the protein family, as well as in creating functions within subfamilies. That is, differential conservation maintains properties of a protein structure related to its orientation, and that are important in packing, recognition, and catalysis. Here I define and formulate a new concept, called the selection moment, that detects this evolutionary process in protein sequences. A treatment of its various applications is detailed.",Human
"A dynamical mean-field theory is developed to analyze stochastic single-cell dynamics of gene expression. By explicitly taking account of nonequilibrium and nonadiabatic features of the DNA state fluctuation, two-time correlation functions and response functions of single-cell dynamics are derived. The method is applied to a self-regulating gene to predict a rich variety of dynamical phenomena such as anomalous increase of relaxation time and oscillatory decay of correlations. Effective ""temperature"" defined as the ratio of the correlation to the response in the protein number is small when the DNA state change is frequent, while it grows large when the DNA state change is infrequent, indicating the strong enhancement of noise in the latter case.",Human
This article reports about a novel extension of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) that allows the study of the collective dynamics of complex chemical and structural systems in a spatially resolved manner with a combinatorially complex variety of different system constituents. We show that introducing multipolar interactions between particles leads to extended membrane structures emerging in a self-organized manner and exhibiting both the necessary mechanical stability for transport and fluidity so as to provide a two-dimensional self-organizing dynamic reaction environment for kinetic studies in the context of cell biology. We further show that the emergent dynamics of extended membrane bound objects is in accordance with scaling laws imposed by physics.,Human
"Both short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate the repression of specific sequences of mRNA through the RNA interference pathway. In the last years several experiments have supported the hypothesis that siRNAs and miRNAs may be functionally interchangeable, at least in cultured cells. In this work we verify that this hypothesis is also supported by a computational evidence. We show that a method specifically trained to predict the activity of the exogenous siRNAs assigns a high silencing level to experimentally determined human miRNAs. This result not only supports the idea of siRNAs and miRNAs equivalence but indicates that it is possible to use computational tools developed using synthetic small interference RNAs to investigate endogenous miRNAs.",Human
"A mathematical model of infiltrative tumour growth taking into account cell proliferation, death and motility is considered. The model is formulated in terms of local cell density and nutrient (oxygen) concentration. In the model the rate of cell death depends on the local nutrient level. Thus heterogeneous nutrient distribution in tissue affects tumour structure and development. The existence of automodel solutions is demonstrated and their properties are investigated. The results are compared to the properties of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov and Fisher equations. Influence of the nutrient distribution on the autowave speed selection as well as on the relaxation to automodel solution is demonstrated. The model adequately describes the data, observed in experiments.",Human
"We investigate the mechanisms of histone sliding and detachment with a stochastic model that couples thermally-induced, passive histone sliding with active motor-driven histone unwrapping. Analysis of a passive loop or twist defect-mediated histone sliding mechanism shows that diffusional sliding is enhanced as larger portions of the DNA is peeled off the histone. The mean times to histone detachment and the mean distance traveled by the motor complex prior to histone detachment are computed as functions of the intrinsic speed of the motor. Fast motors preferentially induce detachment over sliding. However, for a fixed motor speed, increasing the histone-DNA affinity (and thereby decreasing the passive sliding rate) increases the mean distance traveled by the motor.",Human
"We study general aspects of active motion with fluctuations in the speed and the direction of motion in two dimensions. We consider the case in which fluctuations in the speed are not correlated to fluctuations in the direction of motion, and assume that both processes can be described by independent characteristic time-scales. We show the occurrence of a complex transient that can exhibit a series of alternating regimes of motion, for two different angular dynamics which correspond to persistent and directed random walks. We also show additive corrections to the diffusion coefficient. The characteristic time-scales are also exposed in the velocity autocorrelation, which is a sum of exponential forms.",Human
"Lieberman and Melott built their recent arXiv preprint 0704.2896 on my published paper and (a preprint of) a subsequent comment by Liebermans associate Cornette. But had this group waited for the Cornette comment to actually appear in print together with the expected Reply, they would have learned that his comment exposes Cornettes confusion that likely was due to journal misprint of my figure. Thus 0704.2896 is baseless. Despite receiving the extended Reply with Errata, these authors still fail to recognize that detrending of paleontological records-which they erroneously promote as a must-is an arbitrary rather than a universal operation.",Human
"We propose a new simple model for DNA denaturation bases on the pendulum model of Englander\cite{A1} and the microscopic model of Peyrard {\it et al.},\cite{A3} so called ""combined model"". The main parameters of our model are: the coupling constant $k$ along each strand, the mean stretching $y^\ast$ of the hydrogen bonds, the ratio of the damping constant and driven force $\gamma/F$. We show that both the length $L$ of unpaired bases and the velocity $v$ of kinks depend on not only the coupling constant $k$ but also the temperature $T$. Our results are in good agreement with previous works.",Human
"We study the length distribution of a particular class of DNA sequences known as 5'UTR exons. These exons belong to the messanger RNA of protein coding genes, but they are not coding (they are located upstream of the coding portion of the mRNA) and are thus less constrained from an evolutionary point of view. We show that both in mouse and in human these exons show a very clean power law decay in their length distribution and suggest a simple evolutionary model which may explain this finding. We conjecture that this power law behaviour could indeed be a general feature of higher eukaryotes.",Human
"Purcell's scallop theorem defines the type of motions of a solid body - reciprocal motions - which cannot propel the body in a viscous fluid with zero Reynolds number. For example, the flapping of a wing is reciprocal and, as was recently shown, can lead to directed motion only if its frequency Reynolds number, Re_f, is above a critical value of order one. Using elementary examples, we show the existence of oscillatory reciprocal motions which are effective for all arbitrarily small values of the frequency Reynolds number and induce net velocities scaling as (Re_f)^\alpha (alpha > 0). This demonstrates a continuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with inertia.",Human
"We solve the Unanimity Rule on networks with exponential, uniform and scalefree degree distributions. In particular we arrive at equations relating the asymptotic number of nodes in one of two states to the initial fraction of nodes in this state. The solutions for exponential and uniform networks are exact, the approximation for the scalefree case is in perfect agreement with simulation results. We use these solutions to provide a theoretical understanding for experimental data on biodiversity loss in foodwebs, which is available for the three network types discussed. The model allows in principle to estimate the critical value of species that have to be removed from the system to induce its complete collapse.",Human
"We used the atomic force microscope to manipulate and unfold individual molecules of the titin I27 domain and reconstructed its free energy surface using Jarzynski's equality. The free energy surface for both stretching and unfolding was reconstructed using an exact formula that relates the nonequilibrium work fluctuations to the molecular free energy. In addition, the unfolding free energy barrier, i.e. the activation energy, was directly obtained from experimental data for the first time. This work demonstrates that Jarzynski's equality can be used to analyze nonequilibrium single-molecule experiments, and to obtain the free energy surfaces for molecular systems, including interactions for which only nonequilibrium work can be measured.",Human
"Surface modified amorphous nanoporous silica molecules with hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic character can be effectively used as therapeutic drug for combating chicken malaria in poultry industry. The amorphous nanosilica was developed by top-down approach using volcanic soil derived silica as source material. Amorphous silica has long been used as feed additive for poultry industry and considered to be safe for human consumption by WHO and USDA. The basic mechanism of action of these nanosilica molecules is mediated by the physical absorption of VLDL, serum triglycerides and other serum cholesterol components in the lipophilic nanopores of nanosilica. This reduces the supply of the host derived cholesterol, thus limiting the growth of the malarial parasite in vivo.",Human
Long range charge transfer experiments in DNA oligomers and the subsequently measured -- and very diverse -- transport response of DNA wires in solid state experiments exemplifies the need for a thorough theoretical understanding of charge migration in DNA-based natural and artificial materials. Here we present a review of tight-binding models for DNA conduction which have the intrinsic merit of containing more structural information than plain rate-equation models while still retaining sufficient detail of the electronic properties. This allows for simulations of transport properties to be more manageable with respect to density functional theory methods or correlated first principle algorithms.,Human
"The maintainance of a stable periodicity during the yeast metabolic cycle involving approximately half of the genome requires a very strict and efficient control of gene expression. For this reason, the metabolic cycle is a very good candidate for testing the role of a class of post-transcriptional regulators, the so called PUF-family, whose genome-wide mRNA binding specificity was recently experimentally assessed. Here we show that an integrated computational analysis of gene expression time series during the metabolic cycle and the mRNA binding specificity of PUF-family proteins allow for a clear demonstration of the very specific role exerted by selective post-transcriptional mRNA degradation in yeast metabolic cycle global regulation.",Human
"The multiple worlds of genetically manipulated laboratory organisms such as transgenic mice or worms with certain gene mutations are somewhat reminiscent of parallel worlds in quantum mechanics. So are various models of aging tested in such organisms. In this context, the tumor suppressor p53 has been found to either accelerate or delay aging, the latter, for instance, in conjunction with ARF, another tumor suppressor, as shown very recently. To more easily determine which of these artificial settings comes closest to real life, I discuss here their features in the light of my protein structure-based insights that have led me to propose a physiological anti-aging role for the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) over the past four years.",Human
"Recently, structural analysis of the human transferrin and growth hormone (GH) amino acid sequences has unravelled that they harbor a motif identical to a pattern found in viral oncoproteins known to bind the primarily nuclear tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (RB). Since related signatures had previously been identified also in insulin and the two insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), the aim of the current study has been to investigate whether further hints substantiating these reported homologies can be found in silico. Here, additional similarities are presented supporting the notion of an insulin superfamily of growth-promoting proteins with dual localization in the extracellular environment and the intracellular space, particularly in the nucleus, as well as characterized by a tropism for RB.",Human
"Chemical reaction systems with a low to moderate number of molecules are typically modeled as discrete jump Markov processes. These systems are oftentimes simulated with methods that produce statistically exact sample paths such as the Gillespie Algorithm or the Next Reaction Method. In this paper we make explicit use of the fact that the initiation times of the reactions can be represented as the firing times of independent, unit rate Poisson processes with internal times given by integrated propensity functions. Using this representation we derive a modified Next Reaction Method and, in a way that achieves efficiency over existing approaches for exact simulation, extend it to systems with time dependent propensities as well as to systems with delays.",Human
"By explicitly representing the reaction times of discrete chemical systems as the firing times of independent, unit rate Poisson processes, we develop a new adaptive tau-leaping procedure. The procedure developed is novel in that accuracy is guaranteed by performing postleap checks. Because the representation we use separates the randomness of the model from the state of the system, we are able to perform the postleap checks in such a way that the statistics of the sample paths generated will not be biased by the rejections of leaps. Further, since any leap condition is ensured with a probability of one, the simulation method naturally avoids negative population values",Human
"We present a simple algorithm for detecting oscillatory behavior in discrete data. The data is used as an input driving force acting on a set of simulated damped oscillators. By monitoring the energy of the simulated oscillators, we can detect oscillatory behavior in data. In application to in vivo deep brain basal ganglia recordings, we found sharp peaks in the spectrum at 20 and 70 Hz. The algorithm is also compared to the conventional fast Fourier transform and circular statistics techniques using computer generated model data, and is found to be comparable to or better than fast Fourier transform in test cases. Circular statistics performed poorly in our tests.",Human
"This paper describes a design of a molecular propagation system in molecular communication. Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm where biological and artificially-created nanomachines communicate over a short distance using molecules. A molecular propagation system in molecular communication directionally transports molecules from a sender to a receiver. In the design described in this paper, protein filaments glide over immobilized motor proteins along preconfigured microlithographic tracks, and the gliding protein filaments carry and transport molecules from a sender to a receiver. In the design, DNA hybridization is used to load and unload the molecules onto and from the carriers at a sender and a receiver. In the design, loading/transporting/unloading processes are autonomous and require no external control.",Human
"We present a mathematical model of glucose-lactose diauxic growth in Escherichia coli including both the postive and negative regulation mechanisms of the lactose operon as well as the inducer exclusion. To validate this model, we first calculated the time evolution of beta-galactosidase for only the lactose nutrient and compared the numerical results with experimental data. Second, we compared the calculated cell biomass of the glucose-lactose diauxic growth with the experimental optical density of the diauxic growth for a particular E. coli MG 1655. For both cases, the numerical calculations from this model are in good agreement with these two experiments' data. The diauxic growth pattern of a wild type E. coli was also investigated.",Human
"The use of mathematical models has helped to shed light on countless phenomena in chemistry and biology. Often, though, one finds that systems of interest in these fields are dauntingly complex. In this paper, we attempt to synthesize and expand upon the body of mathematical results pertaining to the theory of multiple equilibria in chemical reaction networks (CRNs), which has yielded surprising insights with minimal computational effort. Our central focus is a recent, cycle-based theorem by Gheorghe Craciun and Martin Feinberg, which is of significant interest in its own right and also serves, in a somewhat restated form, as the basis for a number of fruitful connections among related results.",Human
"Schizophrenia is a severe, currently incurable, relatively common mental condition. Its symptoms are complex and widespread. It structurally and functionally affects cortical and subcortical regions involved in cognitive, emotional and motivational aspects of behavior. Its cause is unknown, its diagnosis is based on statistical behavior and its treatment is elusive.   Our paradigm addresses the complexity of schizophrenic symptoms. Building upon recent neural vulnerability and limbic dysregulation hypotheses, it offers a mathematical model for the evolution of the limbic system under perturbation. Dependence on parameters and the concept of ""bifurcation"" could be the key to understanding the threshold between ""normality"" and ""disease"".",Human
"Cells continuously probe their environment with membrane receptors, achieving subsecond adaptation of their behaviour [1-3]. Recently, several receptors, including cadherins, were found to bind ligands with a lifetime of order of one second. Here we show at the single molecule level that homotypic C-cadherin association involves transient intermediates lasting less than a few tens of milliseconds. Further, these intermediates transitionned towards more stable states with a kinetic rate displaying exponential decrease with piconewton forces. These features enable cells to detect ligands or measure surrounding mechanical behaviour within a fraction of a second, much more rapidly than was previously thought.",Human
"The diversity of a community that cannot be fully counted must be inferred. The two preeminent inference methods are the MaxEnt method, which uses information in the form of constraints and Bayes' rule which uses information in the form of data. It has been shown that these two methods are special cases of the method of Maximum (relative) Entropy (ME). We demonstrate how this method can be used as a measure of diversity that not only reproduces the features of Shannon's index but exceeds them by allowing more types of information to be included in the inference. A specific example is solved in detail. Additionally, the entropy that is found is the same form as the thermodynamic entropy.",Human
"An analytical description of the response properties of simple but realistic neuron models in the presence of noise is still lacking. We determine completely up to the second order the firing statistics of a single and a pair of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (LIFs) receiving some common slowly filtered white noise. In particular, the auto- and cross-correlation functions of the output spike trains of pairs of cells are obtained from an improvement of the adiabatic approximation introduced in \cite{Mor+04}. These two functions define the firing variability and firing synchronization between neurons, and are of much importance for understanding neuron communication.",Human
"Spike correlations between neurons are ubiquitous in the cortex, but their role is at present not understood. Here we describe the firing response of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (LIF) when it receives a temporarily correlated input generated by presynaptic correlated neuronal populations. Input correlations are characterized in terms of the firing rates, Fano factors, correlation coefficients and correlation timescale of the neurons driving the target neuron. We show that the sum of the presynaptic spike trains cannot be well described by a Poisson process. Solutions of the output firing rate are found in the limit of short and long correlation time scales.",Human
"We describe a model of electron transfer reactions affected by local binding to the donor or acceptor sites of a particle in equilibrium with the solution. The statistics of fluctuations of the donor-acceptor energy gap caused by binding/unbinding events are non-Gaussian, and the resulting free energy surfaces of electron transfer are non-parabolic. The band-width of the charge-transfer optical transition is predicted to pass through a maximum as a function of the concentration of binding particles in the solution. The model is used to rationalize recent observations of pH-dependence of electron transfer rates involving changes in the protonation state of the donor-acceptor complex.",Human
"A description for regulatory genetic network based on generalized potential energy is constructed. The potential energy is derived from the steady state solution of linearized Fokker-Plank equation, and the result is shown to be equivalent to the system of coupled oscillators. The correspondence between the quantities from the mechanical picture and the steady-state fluctuations is established. Explicit calculation is given for auto-regulatory networks in which, the force constant associated with the degree of protein is very weak. Negative feedback not only suppresses the fluctuations but also increases the steepness of the potential. The results for the fluctuations agree completely with those obtained from linear noise Fokker-Planck equation.",Human
"The bacterium E. coli maneuvers itself to regions with high chemoattractant concentrations by performing two stereotypical moves: `runs', in which it moves in near straight lines, and `tumbles', in which it does not advance but changes direction randomly. The duration of each move is stochastic and depends upon the chemoattractant concentration experienced in the recent past. We relate this stochastic behavior to the steady-state density of a bacterium population, and we derive the latter as a function of chemoattractant concentration. In contrast to earlier treatments, here we account for the effects of temporal correlations and variable tumbling durations. A range of behaviors obtains, that depends subtly upon several aspects of the system - memory, correlation, and tumbling stochasticity in particular.",Human
"We compute absolute binding affinities for two ligands bound to the FKBP protein using non-equilibrium unbinding simulations. The methodology is straight-forward, requiring little or no modification to many modern molecular simulation packages. The approach makes use of a physical pathway, eliminating the need for complicated alchemical decoupling schemes. Results of this study are promising. For the ligands studied here the binding affinities are typically estimated within less than 4.0 kJ/mol of the target values; and the target values are within less than 1.0 kJ/mol of experiment. These results suggest that non-equilibrium simulation could provide a simple and robust means to estimate protein-ligand binding affinities.",Human
"We show how accurate kinetic information, such as the rates of protein folding and unfolding, can be extracted from replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. From the brief and continuous trajectory segments between replica exchanges, we estimate short-time propagators in conformation space and use them to construct a master equation. For a helical peptide in explicit water, we determine the rates of transitions both locally between microscopic conformational states and globally for folding and unfolding. We show that accurate rates in the ~1/(100 ns) to ~1/(1 ns) range can be obtained from REMD with exchange times of 5 ps, in excellent agreement with results from long equilibrium molecular dynamics.",Human
"Based upon the membrane currents generated by an action potential in a biologically realistic model of a pyramidal, hippocampal cell within rat CA1, we perform a moment expansion of the extracellular field potential. We decompose the potential into both inverse and classical moments and show that this method is a rapid and efficient way to calculate the extracellular field both near and far from the cell body. The action potential gives rise to a large quadrupole moment that contributes to the extracellular field up to distances of almost 1 cm. This method will serve as a starting point in connecting the microscopic generation of electric fields at the level of neurons to macroscopic observables such as the local field potential.",Human
"The birth/death process with mutation describes the evolution of a population, and displays rich dynamics including clustering and fluctuations. We discuss an analytical `field-theoretical' approach to the birth/death process, using a simple dimensional analysis argument to describe evolution as a `Super-Brownian Motion' in the infinite population limit. The field theory technique provides corrections to this for large but finite population, and an exact description at arbitrary population size. This allows a characterisation of the difference between the evolution of a phenotype, for which strong local clustering is observed, and a genotype for which distributions are more dispersed. We describe the approach with sufficient detail for non-specialists.",Human
"The development of a large non-coding fraction in eukaryotic DNA and the phenomenon of the code-bloat in the field of evolutionary computations show a striking similarity. This seems to suggest that (in the presence of mechanisms of code growth) the evolution of a complex code can't be attained without maintaining a large inactive fraction. To test this hypothesis we performed computer simulations of an evolutionary toy model for Turing machines, studying the relations among fitness and coding/non-coding ratio while varying mutation and code growth rates. The results suggest that, in our model, having a large reservoir of non-coding states constitutes a great (long term) evolutionary advantage.",Human
"Using multicanonical simulations, the authors study the effect of charged end groups on helix formation in alanine based polypeptides. They confirm earlier reports that neutral polyalanine exhibits a pronounced helix-coil transition in gas phase simulations. Introducing a charged Lys+ at the C terminal stabilizes the helix and leads to a higher transition temperature. On the other hand, adding the Lys+ at the N terminal inhibits helix formation. Instead, a more globular structure was found. These results are in agreement with recent experiments on alanine based polypeptides in gas phase. They indicate that present force fields describe accurately the intramolecular interactions in proteins.",Human
"We implement a well-established concept to consider dispersion effects within a Poisson-Boltzmann approach of continuum solvation of proteins. The theoretical framework is particularly suited for boundary element methods. Free parameters are determined by comparison to experimental data as well as high-level quantum mechanical reference calculations. The method is general and can be easily extended in several directions. The model is tested on various chemical substances and found to yield good-quality estimates of the solvation free energy without obvious indication of any introduced bias. Once optimized, the model is applied to a series of proteins, and factors such as protein size or partial charge assignments are studied.",Human
"Population stratification is a problem encountered in several areas of biology and public health. We tackle this problem by mapping a population and its elements attributes into a hypergraph, a natural extension of the concept of graph or network to encode associations among any number of elements. On this hypergraph, we construct a statistical model reflecting our intuition about how the elements attributes can emerge from a postulated population structure. Finally, we introduce the concept of stratification representativeness as a mean to identify the simplest stratification already containing most of the information about the population structure. We demonstrate the power of this framework stratifying an animal and a human population based on phenotypic and genotypic properties, respectively.",Human
"The precision of biochemical signaling is limited by randomness in the diffusive arrival of molecules at their targets. For proteins binding to the specific sites on the DNA and regulating transcription, the ability of the proteins to diffuse in one dimension by sliding along the length of the DNA, in addition to their diffusion in bulk solution, would seem to generate a larger target for DNA binding, consequently reducing the noise in the occupancy of the regulatory site. Here we show that this effect is largely cancelled by the enhanced temporal correlations in one dimensional diffusion. With realistic parameters, sliding along DNA has surprisingly little effect on the physical limits to the precision of transcriptional regulation.",Human
"We probe the dynamic strength of multiple biotin-streptavidin adhesion bonds under linear loading using the biomembrane force probe setup for dynamic force spectroscopy. Measured rupture force histograms are compared to results from a master equation model for the stochastic dynamics of bond rupture under load. This allows us to extract the distribution of the number of initially closed bonds. We also extract the molecular parameters of the adhesion bonds, in good agreement with earlier results from single bond experiments. Our analysis shows that the peaks in the measured histograms are not simple multiples of the single bond values, but follow from a superposition procedure which generates different peak positions.",Human
Developing fast and efficient algorithms for retrieval of objects to a given user query is an area of active research. The present study investigates retrieval of time series objects from a phoneme database to a given user pattern or query. The proposed method maps the one-dimensional time series retrieval into a sequence retrieval problem by partitioning the multi-dimensional phase-space using k-means clustering. The problem of whole sequence as well as subsequence matching is considered. Robustness of the proposed technique is investigated on phoneme time series corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise. The shortcoming of classical power-spectral techniques for time series retrieval is also discussed.,Human
"We consider words as a network of interacting letters, and approximate the probability distribution of states taken on by this network. Despite the intuition that the rules of English spelling are highly combinatorial (and arbitrary), we find that maximum entropy models consistent with pairwise correlations among letters provide a surprisingly good approximation to the full statistics of four letter words, capturing ~92% of the multi-information among letters and even ""discovering"" real words that were not represented in the data from which the pairwise correlations were estimated. The maximum entropy model defines an energy landscape on the space of possible words, and local minima in this landscape account for nearly two-thirds of words used in written English.",Human
"This Letter studies the quasispecies dynamics of a population capable of genetic repair evolving on a time-dependent fitness landscape. We develop a model that considers an asexual population of single-stranded, conservatively replicating genomes, whose only source of genetic variation is due to copying errors during replication. We consider a time-dependent, single-fitness-peak landscape where the master sequence changes by a single point mutation every time $ \tau $. We are able to analytically solve for the evolutionary dynamics of the population in the point-mutation limit. In particular, our model provides an analytical expression for the fraction of mutators in the dynamic fitness landscape that agrees well with results from stochastic simulations.",Human
"The peculiarity of the distribution and geometry of metallic ions in enzymes pushed us to set the hypothesis that metallic ions in active-site act like tiny antennas able to pick up very feeble e.m. signals. Enzymatic activity of Cu2+, Zn2+ Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) and Fe2+ Xanthine Oxidase (XO) has been studied, following in vitro generation and removal of free radicals. We observed that Superoxide radicals generation by XO is increased by a weak field having the Larmor frequency fL of Fe2+ while the SOD1 kinetics is sensibly reduced by exposure to a weak field having the frequency fL of Cu2+ ion.",Human
"Using a combination of theory and computer simulations, we study the translocation of an RNA molecule, pulled through a solid-state nanopore by an optical tweezer, as a method to determine its secondary structure. The resolution with which the elements of the secondary structure can be determined is limited by thermal fluctuations. We present a detailed study of these thermal fluctuations, including the frequency spectrum, and show that these rule out single-nucleotide resolution under the experimental conditions which we simulated. Two possible ways to improve this resolution are strong stretching of the RNA with a back-pulling voltage across the membrane, and stiffening of the translocated part of the RNA by biochemical means.",Human
"The occurrence of a critical period of plasticity in the visual cortex has long been established, yet its function in normal development is not fully understood. Here we show that as the late phase of the critical period unfolds, different areas of cat visual cortex develop in a coordinated manner. Orientation columns in areas V1 and V2 become matched in size in regions that are mutually connected. The same age trend is found for such regions in the left and right brain hemisphere. Our results indicate that a function of critical period plasticity is to progressively coordinate the functional architectures of different cortical areas - even across hemispheres.",Human
"The understanding of inactivation radiobiological mechanism in individual cells is important when from one side the application of ionizing radiation to tumour therapy and from the other side the protection against radiation are to be effectively improved. Important part of this mechanism is double-strand break (DSB) formation; these DSB may be formed directly by impacting ionizing particles or indirectly by different secondary radicals. The latter kind of formation is much more frequent when cells contain normal water content. Mathematical model of the corresponding chemical stage will be presented with the aim to demonstrate how the individual radicals, but also other chemical agents present in the water during irradiation may influence DSB formation.",Human
"The equilibrium statistical properties of DNA denaturation bubbles are examined in detail within the framework of the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model. Bubble formation in homogeneous DNA is found to depend crucially on the presence of nonlinear base-stacking interactions. Small bubbles extending over less than 10 base pairs are associated with much larger free energies of formation per site than larger bubbles. As the critical temperature is approached, the free energy associated with further bubble growth becomes vanishingly small. An analysis of average displacement profiles of bubbles of varying sizes at different temperatures reveals almost identical scaled shapes in the absence of nonlinear stacking; nonlinear stacking leads to distinct scaled shapes of large and small bubbles.",Human
"Fifty years ago, John von Neumann compared the architecture of the brain with that of computers that he invented and which is still in use today. In those days, the organisation of computers was based on concepts of brain organisation. Here, we give an update on current results on the global organisation of neural systems. For neural systems, we outline how the spatial and topological architecture of neuronal and cortical networks facilitates robustness against failures, fast processing, and balanced network activation. Finally, we discuss mechanisms of self-organization for such architectures. After all, the organization of the brain might again inspire computer architecture.",Human
A recent problem in community ecology lies in defining structures behind matrices of species interactions. The interest in this area is to quantify the nestedness degree of the matrix after its maximal packing. In this work we evaluate nestedness using the sum of all distances of the occupied sites to the vertex of the matrix. We calculate the distance for two artificial matrices with the same size and occupancy: a random matrix and a perfect nested one. Using these two benchmarks we develop a nestedness estimator. The estimator is applied to a set of 23 real networks of insect-plant interactions.,Human
"In recent work we presented a new approach to the analysis of weighted networks, by providing a straightforward generalization of any network measure defined on unweighted networks. This approach is based on the translation of a weighted network into an ensemble of edges, and is particularly suited to the analysis of fully connected weighted networks. Here we apply our method to several such networks including distance matrices, and show that the clustering coefficient, constructed by using the ensemble approach, provides meaningful insights into the systems studied. In the particular case of two data sets from microarray experiments the clustering coefficient identifies a number of biologically significant genes, outperforming existing identification approaches.",Human
"Active cellular transport is a fundamental mechanism for protein and vesicle delivery, cell cycle and molecular degradation. Viruses can hijack the transport system and use it to reach the nucleus. Most transport processes consist of intermittent dynamics, where the motion of a particle, such as a virus, alternates between pure Brownian and directed movement along microtubules. In this communication, we estimate the mean time for particle to attach to a microtubule network. This computation leads to a coarse grained equation of the intermittent motion in radial and cylindrical geometries. Finally, by using the degradation activity inside the cytoplasm, we obtain refined asymptotic estimations for the probability and the mean time a virus reaches a small nuclear pore.",Human
"The design of large libraries of oligonucleotides having constant GC-content and satisfying Hamming distance constraints between oligonucleotides and their Watson-Crick complements is important in reducing hybridization errors in DNA computing, DNA microarray technologies, and molecular bar coding. Various techniques have been studied for the construction of such oligonucleotide libraries, ranging from algorithmic constructions via stochastic local search to theoretical constructions via coding theory. We introduce a new stochastic local search method which yields improvements up to more than one third of the benchmark lower bounds of Gaborit and King (2005) for n-mer oligonucleotide libraries when n <= 14. We also found several optimal libraries by computing maximum cliques on certain graphs.",Human
"As shown by Ganan-Calvo and co-workers, a free liquid jet can be compressed in iameter through gas-dynamic forces exerted by a co-flowing gas, obviating the need for a solid nozzle to form a microscopic liquid jet and thereby alleviating the clogging problems that plague conventional droplet sources of small diameter. We describe in this paper a novel form of droplet beam source based on this principle. The source is miniature, robust, dependable, easily fabricated, and eminently suitable for delivery of microscopic liquid droplets, including hydrated biological samples, into vacuum for analysis using vacuum instrumentation. Monodisperse, single file droplet streams are generated by triggering the device with a piezoelectric actuator. The device is essentially immune to clogging.",Human
"Dynamin is a ubiquitous GTPase that tubulates lipid bilayers and is implicated in many membrane severing processes in eukaryotic cells. Setting the grounds for a better understanding of this biological function, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics description of the conformational change of large dynamin-membrane tubes taking into account GTP consumption as a free energy source. On observable time scales, dissipation is dominated by an effective dynamin/membrane friction and the deformation field of the tube has a simple diffusive behavior, which could be tested experimentally. A more involved, semi-microscopic model yields complete predictions for the dynamics of the tube and possibly accounts for contradictory experimental results concerning its change of conformation as well as for plectonemic supercoiling.",Human
"{\it Transcription} is the process whereby RNA molecules are polymerized by molecular machines, called RNA polymerase (RNAP), using the corresponding DNA as the template. Recent {\it in-vivo} experiments with single cells have established that transcription takes place in ""bursts"" or ""pulses"". In this letter we present a model that captures not only the mechano-chemistry of individual RNAPs and their steric interactions but also the switching of the gene between the ON and OFF states. This model accounts for the statistical properties of the transcriptional bursts. It also shows how the quantitative features of the distributions of these bursts can be tuned by controlling the appropriate steps of operation of the RNAP machines.",Human
"When moving from native to light activated bacteriorhodopsin, modification of charge transport consisting of an increase of conductance is correlated to the protein conformational change. A theoretical model based on a map of the protein tertiary structure into a resistor network is implemented to account for a sequential tunneling mechanism of charge transfer through neighbouring amino acids. The model is validated by comparison with current-voltage experiments. The predictability of the model is further tested on bovine rhodopsin, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) also sensitive to light. In this case, results show an opposite behaviour with a decrease of conductance in the presence of light.",Human
"Conventional kinesin is a motor protein, which is able to walk along a microtubule processively. The exact mechanism of the stepping motion and force generation of kinesin is still far from clear. In this paper we argue that neck linker docking is a crucial element of this mechanism, without which the experimentally observed dwell times of the steps could not be explained under a wide range of loading forces. We also show that the experimental data impose very strict constraints on the lengths of both the neck linker and its docking section, which are compatible with the known structure of kinesin.",Human
"A mechanism of extraction of tubular membranes from a lipid vesicle is presented. A concentration gradient of anchoring amphiphilic polymers generates tubes from bud-like vesicle protrusions. We explain this mechanism in the framework of the Canham-Helfrich model. The energy profile is analytically calculated and a tube with a fixed length, corresponding to an energy minimum, is obtained in a certain regime of parameters. Further, using a phase-field model, we corroborate these results numerically. We obtain the growth of tubes when a polymer source is added, and the bud-like shape after removal of the polymer source, in accordance with recent experimental results.",Human
"The effect of disorder in the energetic heights and in the physical locations of fence barriers encountered by transmembrane molecules such as proteins and lipids in their motion in cell membranes is studied theoretically. The investigation takes as its starting point a recent analysis of a periodic system with constant distances between barriers and constant values of barrier heights, and employs effective medium theory to treat the disorder. The calculations make possible, in principle, the extraction of confinement parameters such as mean compartment sizes and mean intercompartmental transition rates from experimentally reported published observations. The analysis should be helpful both as an unusual application of effective medium theory and as an investigation of observed molecular movements in cell membranes.",Human
"The idea of the evolution of the genetic code from the CG to the CGUA alphabet has been developed further. The assumption of the originally triplet structure of the genetic code has been substantiated. The hypothesis of the emergence of stop codons at the early stage of the evolution of the genetic code has been additionally supported. The existence of strong and weak letter doublets of codons and the symmetry of strong doublets in the genetic code table, discovered by Rumer, have been explained. A hypothesis concerning the primary structure of the first gene and the first protein has been proposed.",Human
Proliferating cell populations at steady state growth often exhibit broad protein distributions with exponential tails. The sources of this variation and its universality are of much theoretical interest. Here we address the problem by asymptotic analysis of the Population Balance Equation. We show that the steady state distribution tail is determined by a combination of protein production and cell division and is insensitive to other model details. Under general conditions this tail is exponential with a dependence on parameters consistent with experiment. We discuss the conditions for this effect to be dominant over other sources of variation and the relation to experiments.,Human
"To achieve propulsion at low Reynolds number, a swimmer must deform in a way that is not invariant under time-reversal symmetry; this result is known as the scallop theorem. We show here that there is no many-scallop theorem. We demonstrate that two active particles undergoing reciprocal deformations can swim collectively; moreover, polar particles also experience effective long-range interactions. These results are derived for a minimal dimers model, and generalized to more complex geometries on the basis of symmetry and scaling arguments. We explain how such cooperative locomotion can be realized experimentally by shaking a collection of soft particles with a homogeneous external field.",Human
"We study the reliability of large networks of coupled neural oscillators in response to fluctuating stimuli. Reliability means that a stimulus elicits essentially identical responses upon repeated presentations. We view the problem on two scales: neuronal reliability, which concerns the repeatability of spike times of individual neurons embedded within a network, and pooled-response reliability, which addresses the repeatability of the total synaptic output from the network. We find that individual embedded neurons can be reliable or unreliable depending on network conditions, whereas pooled responses of sufficiently large networks are mostly reliable. We study also the effects of noise, and find that some types affect reliability more seriously than others.",Human
"We study the effect of permeabilizing electric fields applied to two different types of giant unilamellar vesicles, the first formed from EggPC lipids and the second formed from DOPC lipids. Experiments on vesicles of both lipid types show a decrease in vesicle radius which is interpreted as being due to lipid loss during the permeabilization process. We show that the decrease in size can be qualitatively explained as a loss of lipid area which is proportional to the area of the vesicle which is permeabilized. Three possible mechanisms responsible for lipid loss were directly observed: pore formation, vesicle formation and tubule formation.",Human
"The conformation of circular DNA molecules of various lengths adsorbed in a 2D conformation on a mica surface is studied. The results confirm the conjecture that the critical exponent $\nu$ is topologically invariant and equal to the SAW value (in the present case $\nu=3/4$), and that the topology and dimensionality of the system strongly influences the cross-over between the rigid regime and the self-avoiding regime at a scale $L\approx 8 \ell_p$. Additionally, the bond correlation function scales with the molecular length $L$ as predicted. For molecular lengths $L\leq5 \ell_p$, circular DNA behaves like a stiff molecule with approximately elliptic shape.",Human
"We present the first numerical simulation of actin-driven propulsion by elastic filaments. Specifically, we use a Brownian dynamics formulation of the dendritic nucleation model of actin-driven propulsion. We show that the model leads to a self-assembled network that exerts forces on a disk and pushes it with an average speed. This simulation approach is the first to observe a speed that varies non-monotonically with the concentration of branching proteins (Arp2/3), capping protein and depolymerization rate (ADF), in accord with experimental observations. Our results suggest a new interpretation of the origin of motility that can be tested readily by experiment.",Human
"We study the spreading of excitations in 2D systems of mobile agents where the excitation is transmitted when a quiescent agent keeps contact with an excited one during a non-vanishing time. We show that the steady states strongly depend on the spatial agent dynamics. Moreover, the coupling between exposition time ($\omega$) and agent-agent contact rate (CR) becomes crucial to understand the excitation dynamics, which exhibits three regimes with CR: no excitation for low CR, an excited regime in which the number of quiescent agents (S) is inversely proportional to CR, and for high CR, a novel third regime, model dependent, here S scales with an exponent $\xi -1$, with $\xi$ being the scaling exponent of $\omega$ with CR.",Human
"The scale invariance of natural images suggests an analogy to the statistical mechanics of physical systems at a critical point. Here we examine the distribution of pixels in small image patches and show how to construct the corresponding thermodynamics. We find evidence for criticality in a diverging specific heat, which corresponds to large fluctuations in how ""surprising"" we find individual images, and in the quantitative form of the entropy vs. energy. The energy landscape derived from our thermodynamic framework identifies special image configurations that have intrinsic error correcting properties, and neurons which could detect these features have a strong resemblance to the cells found in primary visual cortex.",Human
"Cells swimming in confined environments are attracted by surfaces. We measure the steady-state distribution of smooth-swimming bacteria (Escherichia coli) between two glass plates. In agreement with earlier studies, we find a strong increase of the cell concentration at the boundaries. We demonstrate theoretically that hydrodynamic interactions of the swimming cells with solid surfaces lead to their re-orientation in the direction parallel to the surfaces, as well as their attraction by the closest wall. A model is derived for the steady-state distribution of swimming cells, which compares favorably with our measurements. We exploit our data to estimate the flagellar propulsive force in swimming E. coli.",Human
"In forced polymer translocation, the average translocation time, $\tau$, scales with respect to pore force, $f$, and polymer length, $N$, as $\tau \sim f^{-1} N^{\beta}$. We demonstrate that an artifact in Metropolis Monte Carlo method resulting in breakage of the force scaling with large $f$ may be responsible for some of the controversies between different computationally obtained results and also between computational and experimental results. Using Langevin dynamics simulations we show that the scaling exponent $\beta \le 1 + \nu$ is not universal, but depends on $f$. Moreover, we show that forced translocation can be described by a relatively simple force balance argument and $\beta$ to arise solely from the initial polymer configuration.",Human
"Spiral wave propagation in period-2 excitable media is often accompanied by line-defects, the locus of points with period-1 oscillations. Here we investigate spiral line-defects in cardiac tissue where period-2 behavior has a known arrhythmogenic role. We find that the number of line defects, which is constrained to be an odd integer, is three for a freely rotating spiral, with and without meander, but one for a spiral anchored around a fixed heterogeneity. We interpret analytically this finding using a simple theory where spiral wave unstable modes with different numbers of line-defects correspond to quantized solutions of a Helmholtz equation. Furthermore, the slow inward rotation of spiral line-defects is described in different regimes.",Human
"Reciprocal movement cannot be used for locomotion at low-Reynolds number in an infinite fluid or near a rigid surface. Here we show that this limitation is relaxed for a body performing reciprocal motions near a deformable interface. Using physical arguments and scaling relationships, we show that the nonlinearities arising from reciprocal flow-induced interfacial deformation rectify the periodic motion of the swimmer, leading to locomotion. Such a strategy can be used to move toward, away from, and parallel to any deformable interface as long as the length scales involved are smaller than intrinsic scales, which we identify. A macro-scale experiment of flapping motion near a free surface illustrates this new result.",Human
"In parametric sequence alignment, optimal alignments of two sequences are computed as a function of the penalties for mismatches and spaces, producing many different optimal alignments. Here we give a 3/(2^{7/3}\pi^{2/3})n^{2/3} +O(n^{1/3} \log n) lower bound on the maximum number of distinct optimal alignment summaries of length-n binary sequences. This shows that the upper bound given by Gusfield et. al. is tight over all alphabets, thereby disproving the ""square root of n conjecture"". Thus the maximum number of distinct optimal alignment summaries (i.e. vertices of the alignment polytope) over all pairs of length-n sequences is Theta(n^{2/3}).",Human
"Self-arrangement of individuals into spatial patterns often accompanies and promotes species diversity in ecological systems. Here, we investigate pattern formation arising from cyclic dominance of three species, operating near a bifurcation point. In its vicinity, an Eckhaus instability occurs, leading to convectively unstable ""blurred"" patterns. At the bifurcation point, stochastic effects dominate and induce counterintuitive effects on diversity: Large patterns, emerging for medium values of individuals' mobility, lead to rapid species extinction, while small patterns (low mobility) promote diversity, and high mobilities render spatial structures irrelevant. We provide a quantitative analysis of these phenomena, employing a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.",Human
"Excitable membranes are an important type of nonlinear dynamical system and their study can be used to provide a connection between physical and biological circuits. We discuss two models of excitable membranes important in cardiac and neural tissues. One model is based on the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations and the other is based on a three-transistor excitable circuit. We construct a circuit that simulates reentrant tachycardia and its treatment by surgical ablation. This project is appropriate for advanced undergraduates as a laboratory capstone project, or as a senior thesis or honors project, and can also be a collaborative project, with one student responsible for the computational predictions and another for the circuit construction and measurements.",Human
"We propose a principle of consistency between different hierarchical levels of biological systems. Given a consistency between molecule replication and cell reproduction, universal statistical laws on cellular chemical abundances are derived and confirmed experimentally. They include a power law distribution of gene expressions, a lognormal distribution of cellular chemical abundances over cells, and embedding of the power law into the network connectivity distribution. Second, given a consistency between genotype and phenotype, a general relationship between phenotype fluctuations by genetic variation and isogenic phenotypic fluctuation by developmental noise is derived. Third, we discuss the chaos mechanism for stem cell differentiation with autonomous regulation, resulting from a consistency between cell reproduction and growth of the cell ensemble.",Human
"Myosin V was the first discovered processive motor from the myosin family. It has therefore been subject of a number of mechanical, kinetic, optical and structural studies and now belongs to the best characterised motor proteins. This effort has been accompanied by a number of different theoretical models. In this article we give an overview of them and discuss what they have in common and where the open questions are. The latter include the existence of sub-steps, the process that limits the run length, the nature of backward steps, the flexibility of the lever arm and the state of the lead head.",Human
We propose a multi-scale approach to understanding physics related to the ion/proton-beam cancer therapy and calculation of the probability of the DNA damage as a result of irradiation of patients with energetic (up to 430 MeV/u) ions. This approach is inclusive with respect to different scales starting from the long scale defined by the ion stopping followed by a smaller scale defined by secondary electrons and radicals ending with the shortest scale defined by interactions of secondaries with the DNA. We present calculations of the probabilities of single and double strand breaks of the DNA and suggest a way of further elaboration of such calculations.,Human
"Cell is the structural and functional unit of life. This Resource Letter serves as a guide to the literature on nano-machines which drive not only intracellular movements, but also motility of the cell. These machines are usually proteins or macromolecular assemblies which require appropriate fuel for their operations. Although, traditionally, these machines were subjects of investigation in biology and biochemistry, increasing use of the concepts and techniques of physics in recent years have contributed to the quantitative understanding of the fundamental principles underlying their operational mechanisms. The possibility of exploiting these principles for the design and control of artificial nano-machines has opened up a new frontier in the bottom-up approach to nano-technology.",Human
"We propose a model of evolutionary snowdrift game with $N$-person interactions and study the effects of multi-person interactions on the emergence of cooperation. An exact $N$-th-order equation for the equilibrium density of cooperators $x^*$ is derived for a well-mixed population using the approach of replicator dynamics. The results show that the extent of cooperation drops with increasing cost-to-benefit ratio and the number $N$ of interaction persons in a group, with $x^{*}\sim1/N$ for large $N$. An algorithm for numerical simulations is constructed for the model. The simulation results are in good agreements with theoretical results of the replicator dynamics.",Human
"This paper proposes a novel chaotic reaction-diffusion model of cellular tumor growth and metastasis. The model is based on the multiscale diffusion cancer-invasion model (MDCM) and formulated by introducing strong nonlinear coupling into the MDCM. The new model exhibits temporal chaotic behavior (which resembles the classical Lorenz strange attractor) and yet retains all the characteristics of the MDCM diffusion model. It mathematically describes both the processes of carcinogenesis and metastasis, as well as the sensitive dependence of cancer evolution on initial conditions and parameters. On the basis of this chaotic tumor-growth model, a generic concept of carcinogenesis and metastasis is formulated.   Keywords: reaction-diffusion tumor growth model, chaotic attractor, sensitive dependence on initial tumor characteristics",Human
"We investigate the protein expression pattern of the lamB gene in Escherichia coli LE392. The gene product LamB is an important membrane protein for maltose transport into cells but it is also exploited by bacteriophage lambda for infection. Although our bacterial population is clonal, stochastic gene expression leads to a majority population with a large receptor number and a minority population with a small receptor number. We find that the LamB receptor distribution p(n) of the small-n population is scale invariant with the exponent depending on growth conditions. A heuristic model is proposed that relates the observed exponent to the protein production rate.",Human
"We discuss the possibility of multiple underlying etiologies of the condition currently labeled as schizophrenia. We support this hypothesis with a theoretical model of the prefrontal-limbic system. We show how the dynamical behavior of this model depends on an entire set of physiological parameters, representing synaptic strengths, vulnerability to stress-induced cortisol, dopamine regulation and rates of autoantibody production. Malfunction of different such parameters produces similar outward dysregulation of the system, which may readily lead to diagnosis difficulties in a clinician's office. We further place this paradigm within the contexts of pathophysiology and of antipsychotic pharmacology. We finally propose brain profiling as the future quantitative diagnostic toolbox that agrees with a multiple etiologies hypothesis of schizophrenia.",Human
"We investigate the evolution of populations of random Boolean networks under selection for robustness of the dynamics with respect to the perturbation of the state of a node. The fitness landscape contains a huge plateau of maximum fitness that spans the entire network space. When selection is so strong that it dominates over drift, the evolutionary process is accompanied by a slow increase in the mean connectivity and a slow decrease in the mean fitness. Populations evolved with higher mutation rates show a higher robustness under mutations. This means that even though all the evolved populations exist close to the plateau of maximum fitness, they end up in different regions of network space.",Human
"Sex is considered as an evolutionary paradox, since its evolutionary advantage does not necessarily overcome the two fold cost of sharing half of one's offspring's genome with another member of the population. Here we demonstrate that sexual reproduction can be evolutionary stable even when its Darwinian fitness is twice as low when compared to the fitness of asexual mutants. We also show that more than two sexes are always evolutionary unstable. Our approach generalizes the evolutionary game theory to analyze species whose members are able to sense the sexual state of their conspecifics and to switch sexes consequently. The widespread emergence and maintenance of sex follows therefore from its co-evolution with even more widespread environmental sensing abilities.",Human
"We have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) running in Matlab, called Weighted-Interaction Nestedness Estimator, WINE (Fig. 1). WINE is a Matlab application developed to perform the calculation of the new weighted nestedness estimator. This program allows the user to: open a data file, select the range of data to be analysed, and calculate the results, obtaining two graphics and three indices. The indices shown in the graphical interface are: a) weighted nestedness of the frequency matrix, b) average weighted nestedness of 100 random matrices of similar characteristics, and c) the new weighted- interaction nestedness estimator, which compares the two previous results.",Human
"We consider the application of Kramers theory to the microscopic calculation of rates of conformational transitions of macromolecules. The main difficulty in such an approach is to locate the transition state in a huge configuration space. We present a method which identifies the transition state along the most probable reaction pathway. It is then possible to microscopically compute the activation energy, the damping coefficient, the eigenfrequencies at the transition state and obtain the rate, without any a-priori choice of a reaction coordinate. Our theoretical results are tested against the results of Molecular Dynamics simulations for transitions in a 2-dimensional double well and for the cis-trans isomerization of a linear molecule.",Human
"The two classic theories for the existence of sexual replication are that sex purges deleterious mutations from a population, and that sex allows a population to adapt more rapidly to changing environments. These two theories have often been presented as opposing explanations for the existence of sex. Here, we develop and analyze evolutionary models based on the asexual and sexual replication pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), and show that sexual replication can both purge deleterious mutations in a static environment, as well as lead to faster adaptation in a dynamic environment. This implies that sex can serve a dual role, which is in sharp contrast to previous theories.",Human
Isolated human buccal epithelium cell were irradiated by microwaves at frequency f=35 GHz and surface power density E=30 mcW/cm2. The state of chromatin in human cells was determined by methodsof light and electron microscopy. The state of cell membranes was evaluated by the method of vital indigo carmine staining. The microwave-induced condensation of chromatin in human cells was revealed. Left side circulary polarized waves induced less effect than linearly polarized radiation. The linearly polarized electromagnetic waves induced cell membrane damage revealed by the increase of cell stainability. The data obtained are discussed in connection with the mechanisms of biologica effect of electromagnetic waves.,Human
"Voltage-gated ion channels are key molecules for the generation and propagation of electrical signals in excitable cell membranes. The voltage-dependent switching of these channels between conducting and nonconducting states is a major factor in controlling the transmembrane voltage. In this study, a statistical mechanics model of these molecules has been discussed on the basis of a two-dimensional spin model. A new Hamiltonian and a new Monte Carlo simulation algorithm are introduced to simulate such a model. It was shown that the results well match the experimental data obtained from batrachotoxin-modified sodium channels in the squid giant axon using the cut-open axon technique.",Human
"A connection is established between discrete stochastic model describing microscopic motion of fluctuating cells, and macroscopic equations describing dynamics of cellular density. Cells move towards chemical gradient (process called chemotaxis) with their shapes randomly fluctuating. Nonlinear diffusion equation is derived from microscopic dynamics in dimensions one and two using excluded volume approach. Nonlinear diffusion coefficient depends on cellular volume fraction and it is demonstrated to prevent collapse of cellular density. A very good agreement is shown between Monte Carlo simulations of the microscopic Cellular Potts Model and numerical solutions of the macroscopic equations for relatively large cellular volume fractions. Combination of microscopic and macroscopic models were used to simulate growth of structures similar to early vascular networks.",Human
"During fast locomotion - gallop, half bound - of quadruped mammals, the ground contact of the limbs in each pair do not alternate symmetrically. Animals using such asymmetrical gait thus choose whether the left or the right limb will contact the ground first, and this gives rise to limb preference. Here, we report that dogs (Mammalia, Carnivora) and pikas (Mammalia, Lagomorpha) prefer one forelimb as trailing limb and use it as such almost twice as often as the other. We also show that this choice depends on the individual and is not a characteristic of the species, and that the strength of the preference was not dependent on the animal's running speed.",Human
"The purpose of this article is to show how the isotropy subgroup of leaf permutations on binary trees can be used to systematically identify tree-informative invariants relevant to models of phylogenetic evolution. In the quartet case, we give an explicit construction of the full set of representations and describe their properties. We apply these results directly to Markov invariants, thereby extending previous theoretical results by systematically identifying linear combinations that vanish for a given quartet. We also note that the theory is fully generalizable to arbitrary trees and is equally applicable to the related case of phylogenetic invariants. All results follow from elementary consideration of the representation theory of finite groups.",Human
"We extend the Saffman theory of membrane hydrodynamics to account for the correlated motion of membrane proteins, along with the effect of protein concentration on that correlation and on the response of the membrane to stresses. Expressions for the coupling diffusion coefficients of protein pairs and their concentration dependence are derived in the limit of small protein size relative to the inter-protein separation. The additional role of membrane viscosity as determining the characteristic length scale for membrane response leads to unusual concentration effects at large separation -- the transverse coupling increases with protein concentration, whereas the longitudinal one becomes concentration-independent.",Human
"Main aim of this topical issue is to report recent advances in noisy nonequilibrium processes useful to describe the dynamics of ecological systems and to address the mechanisms of spatio-temporal pattern formation in ecology both from the experimental and theoretical points of view. This is in order to understand the dynamical behaviour of ecological complex systems through the interplay between nonlinearity, noise, random and periodic environmental interactions. Discovering the microscopic rules and the local interactions which lead to the emergence of specific global patterns or global dynamical behaviour and the noises role in the nonlinear dynamics is an important, key aspect to understand and then to model ecological complex systems.",Human
"Rigidity analysis using the ""pebble game"" can usefully be applied to protein crystal structures to obtain information on protein folding, assembly and the structure-function relationship. However, previous work using this technique has not made clear how sensitive rigidity analysis is to small structural variations. We present a comparative study in which rigidity analysis is applied to multiple structures, derived from different organisms and different conditions of crystallisation, for each of several different proteins. We find that rigidity analysis is best used as a comparative tool to highlight the effects of structural variation. Our use of multiple protein structures brings out a previously unnoticed peculiarity in the rigidity of trypsin.",Human
"In this paper we propose a microscopic model to study the polymerization of microtubules (MTs). Starting from fundamental reactions during MT's assembly and disassembly processes, we systematically derive a nonlinear system of equations that determines the dynamics of microtubules in 3D. %coexistence with tubulin dimers in a solution. We found that the dynamics of a MT is mathematically expressed via a cubic-quintic nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. Interestingly, the generic 3D solution of the NLS equation exhibits linear growing and shortening in time as well as temporal fluctuations about a mean value which are qualitatively similar to the dynamic instability of MTs observed experimentally. By solving equations numerically, we have found spatio-temporal patterns consistent with experimental observations.",Human
"We propose a strange-attractor model of tumor growth and metastasis. It is a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal cancer model with strong nonlinear couplings. Even the same type of tumor is different in every patient both in size and appearance, as well as in temporal behavior. This is clearly a characteristic of dynamical systems sensitive to initial conditions. The new chaotic model of tumor growth and decay is biologically motivated. It has been developed as a live Mathematica demonstration, see Wolfram Demonstrator site: http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ChaoticAttractorInTumorGrowth/ Key words: Reaction-diffusion tumor growth model, chaotic attractor, sensitive dependence on initial tumor characteristics",Human
"We study a simplified, solvable model of a fully-connected metabolic network with constrained quenched disorder to mimic the conservation laws imposed by stoichiometry on chemical reactions. Within a spin-glass type of approach, we show that in presence of a conserved metabolic pool the flux state corresponding to maximal growth is stationary independently of the pool size. In addition, and at odds with the case of unconstrained networks, the volume of optimal flux configurations remains finite, indicating that the frustration imposed by stoichiometric constraints, while reducing growth capabilities, confers robustness and flexibility to the system. These results have a clear biological interpretation and provide a basic, fully analytical explanation to features recently observed in real metabolic networks.",Human
"We consider an inertial model of chemotactic aggregation generalizing the Keller-Segel model and we study the linear dynamical stability of an infinite and homogeneous distribution of cells (bacteria, amoebae, endothelial cells,...) when inertial effects are accounted for. These inertial terms model cells directional persistance. We determine the condition of instability and the growth rate of the perturbation as a function of the cell density and the wavelength of the perturbation. We discuss the differences between overdamped (Keller-Segel) and inertial models. Finally, we show the analogy between the instability criterion for biological populations and the Jeans instability criterion in astrophysics.",Human
"Eukaryotic cells possess a sensible chemical compass allowing them to orient toward sources of soluble chemicals. The extracellular chemical signal triggers separation of the cell membrane into two domains populated by different phospholipid molecules and oriented along the signal anisotropy. We propose a theory of this polarization process, which is articulated into subsequent stages of germ nucleation, patch coarsening and merging into a single domain. We find that the polarization time, $t_\epsilon$, depends on the anisotropy degree $\epsilon$ through the power law $t_\epsilon\propto \epsilon^{-2}$, and that in a cell of radius $R$ there should exist a threshold value $\epsilon_\mathrm{th}\propto R^{-1}$ for the smallest detectable anisotropy.",Human
"How might systematic left-right (L/R) asymmetry of the body plan originate in multicellular animals (and plants)? Somehow, the microscopic handedness of biological molecules must be brought up to macroscopic scales. Basic symmetry principles suggest that the usual ""biological"" mechanisms -- diffusion and gene regulation -- are insufficient to implement the ""right-hand rule"" defining a third body axis from the other two. Instead, on the cellular level, ""physical"" mechanisms (forces and collective dynamic states) are needed involving the long stiff fibers of the cytoskeleton. I discuss some possible scenarios; only in the case of vertebrate internal organs is the answer currently known (and even that is in dispute).",Human
"We propose a multi-scale approach to understand the physics related to ion-beam cancer therapy. It allows the calculation of the probability of DNA damage as a result of irradiation of tissues with energetic ions, up to 430 MeV/u. This approach covers different scales, starting from the large scale, defined by the ion stopping, followed by a smaller scale, defined by secondary electrons and radicals, and ending with the shortest scale, defined by interactions of secondaries with the DNA. We present calculations of the probabilities of single and double strand breaks of DNA, suggest a way to further expand such calculations, and also make some estimates for glial cells exposed to radiation.",Human
"The existence of beyond mean field quasi-cycle oscillations in a simple spatial model of predator prey interactions is derived from a path integral formalism. The results agree substantially with those obtained from analysis of similar models using system size expansions of the master equation. In all of these analyses, the discrete nature of predator prey populations and finite size effects lead to persistent oscillations in time, but spatial patterns fail to form. The path integral formalism goes beyond mean field theory and provides a focus on individual realizations of the stochastic time evolution of population not captured in the standard master equation approach.",Human
"The classification of life should be based upon the fundamental mechanism in the evolution of life. We found that the global relationships among species should be circular phylogeny, which is quite different from the common sense based upon phylogenetic trees. The genealogical circles can be observed clearly according to the analysis of protein length distributions of contemporary species. Thus, we suggest that domains can be defined by distinguished phylogenetic circles, which are global and stable characteristics of living systems. The mechanism in genome size evolution has been clarified; hence main component questions on C-value enigma can be explained. According to the correlations and quasi-periodicity of protein length distributions, we can also classify life into three domains.",Human
"The inference of gene regulatory networks from high throughput gene expression data is one of the major challenges in systems biology. This paper aims at analysing and comparing two different algorithmic approaches. The first approach uses pairwise correlations between regulated and regulating genes; the second one uses message-passing techniques for inferring activating and inhibiting regulatory interactions. The performance of these two algorithms can be analysed theoretically on well-defined test sets, using tools from the statistical physics of disordered systems like the replica method. We find that the second algorithm outperforms the first one since it takes into account collective effects of multiple regulators.",Human
"We propose a simple model of cytochrome c oxidase, including four redox centers and four protonable sites, to study the time evolution of electrostatically coupled electron and proton transfers initiated by the injection of a single electron into the enzyme. We derive a system of master equations for electron and proton state probabilities and show that an efficient pumping of protons across the membrane can be obtained for a reasonable set of parameters. All four experimentally observed kinetic phases appear naturally from our model. We also calculate the dependence of the pumping efficiency on the transmembrane voltage at different temperatures and discuss a possible mechanism of the redox-driven proton translocation.",Human
"The analysis of the ultrasonic frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient of aggregating red blood cells reveals information about blood structural properties. The difficulty to apply this technique in vivo is due to the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by intervening tissue layers that distorts the spectral content of backscattering properties from blood microstructures. An optimization method is proposed to simultaneously estimate tissue attenuation and blood structure factor. In an in vitro experiment, the method gave satisfactory estimates with relative errors below 22% for attenuations between 0.101 and 0.317 dB/cm/MHz, signal-to-noise ratios>28 dB and kR<2.7 (k being the wave number and R the aggregate radius).",Human
"Modular structure is ubiquitous among real-world networks from related proteins to social groups. Here we analyze the modular organization of brain networks at a large-scale (voxel level) extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. By using a random walk-based method, we unveil the modularity of brain-webs, and show that modules with a spatial distribution that matches anatomical structures with functional significance. The functional role of each node in the network is studied by analyzing its patterns of inter- and intra-modular connections. Results suggest that the modular architecture constitutes the structural basis for the coexistence of functional integration of distant and specialized brain areas during normal brain activities at rest.",Human
"The origin of stochastic fluctuations in gene expression has received considerable attention recently. Fluctuations in gene expression are particularly pronounced in cellular systems because of the small copy number of species undergoing transitions between discrete chemical states and the small size of biological compartments. In this paper, we propose a stochastic model for gene expression regulation including several binding sites, considering elementary reactions only. The model is used to investigate the role of cooperativity on the intrinsic fluctuations of gene expression, by means of master equation formalism. We found that the Hill coefficient and the level of noise increases as the interaction energy between activators increases. Additionally, we show that the model allows to distinguish between two cooperative binding mechanisms.",Human
"Pyro-Align is a multiple alignment program specifically designed for pyrosequencing reads of huge number. Multiple sequence alignment is shown to be NP-hard and heuristics are designed for approximate solutions. Multiple sequence alignment of pyrosequenceing reads is complex mainly because of 2 factors. One being the huge number of reads, making the use of traditional heuristics,that scale very poorly for large number, unsuitable. The second reason is that the alignment cannot be performed arbitrarily, because the position of the reads with respect to the original genome is important and has to be taken into account.In this report we present a short description of the multiple alignment system for pyrosequencing reads.",Human
"Mechanical oscillations are important for many cellular processes, e.g. the beating of cilia and flagella or the sensation of sound by hair cells. These dynamic states originate from spontaneous oscillations of molecular motors. A particularly clear example of such oscillations has been observed in muscle fibers under non-physiological conditions. In that case, motor oscillations lead to contraction waves along the fiber. By a macroscopic analysis of muscle fiber dynamics we find that the spontaneous waves involve non-hydrodynamic modes. A simple microscopic model of sarcomere dynamics highlights mechanical aspects of the motor dynamics and fits with the experimental observations.",Human
"A new delay equation is introduced to describe the punctuated evolution of complex nonlinear systems. A detailed analytical and numerical investigation provides the classification of all possible types of solutions for the dynamics of a population in the four main regimes dominated respectively by: (i) gain and competition, (ii) gain and cooperation, (iii) loss and competition and (iv) loss and cooperation. Our delay equation may exhibit bistability in some parameter range, as well as a rich set of regimes, including monotonic decay to zero, smooth exponential growth, punctuated unlimited growth, punctuated growth or alternation to a stationary level, oscillatory approach to a stationary level, sustainable oscillations, finite-time singularities as well as finite-time death.",Human
"Inspired by problems in biochemical kinetics, we study statistical properties of an overdamped Langevin process whose friction coefficient depends on the state of a similar, unobserved process. Integrating out the latter, we derive the long time behaviour of the mean square displacement. Anomalous diffusion is found. Since the diffusion exponent can not be predicted using a simple scaling argument, anomalous scaling appears as well. We also find that the coupling can lead to ergodic or non-ergodic behaviour of the studied process. We compare our theoretical predictions with numerical simulations and find an excellent agreement. The findings caution against treating biochemical systems coupled with unobserved dynamical degrees of freedom by means of standard, diffusive Langevin descriptions.",Human
"Here we present a program aimed at free-energy calculations in molecular systems. It consists of a series of routines that can be interfaced with the most popular classical molecular dynamics (MD) codes through a simple patching procedure. This leaves the possibility for the user to exploit many different MD engines depending on the system simulated and on the computational resources available. Free-energy calculations can be performed as a function of many collective variables, with a particular focus on biological problems, and using state-of-the-art methods such as metadynamics, umbrella sampling and Jarzynski-equation based steered MD. The present software, written in ANSI-C language, can be easily interfaced with both fortran and C/C++ codes.",Human
"The relationship between a neuron's complex inputs and its spiking output defines the neuron's coding strategy. This is frequently and effectively modeled phenomenologically by one or more linear filters that extract the components of the stimulus that are relevant for triggering spikes, and a nonlinear function that relates stimulus to firing probability. In many sensory systems, these two components of the coding strategy are found to adapt to changes in the statistics of the inputs, in such a way as to improve information transmission. Here, we show for two simple neuron models how feature selectivity as captured by the spike-triggered average depends both on the parameters of the model and on the statistical characteristics of the input.",Human
"Finding and sampling multiple reaction channels for molecular transitions remains an important challenge in physical chemistry. Here we show that the weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling method can readily sample multiple channels. In a first test, both the WE and transition path sampling methods are applied to two-dimensional model potentials. The comparison explains why the weighted ensemble approach will not be trapped in one channel. The WE approach is then used to sample the full transition path ensemble in implicitly solvated alanine dipeptide at two different temperatures. The ensembles are of sufficient quality to permit quantification of the fractional importance of each channel, even at T=300K when brute-force simulation is prohibitively expensive.",Human
"Molecular motors are single macromolecules that generate forces at the piconewton range and nanometer scale. They convert chemical energy into mechanical work by moving along filamentous structures. In this paper, we study the velocity of two-head molecular motors in the framework of a mechanochemical network theory. The network model, a generalization of the recently work of Liepelt and Lipowsky (PRL 98, 258102 (2007)), is based on the discrete mechanochemical states of a molecular motor with multiple cycles. By generalizing the mathematical method developed by Fisher and Kolomeisky for single cycle motor (PNAS(2001) 98(14) P7748-7753), we are able to obtain an explicit formula for the velocity of a molecular motor.",Human
We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA hairpins that fold/unfold under the action of applied mechanical force. We introduce the concept of the molecular free energy landscape and derive simplified expressions for the force dependent Kramers-Bell rates. To test the theory we have designed a specific DNA hairpin sequence that shows two-state cooperative folding under mechanical tension and carried out pulling experiments using optical tweezers. We show how we can determine the parameters that characterize the molecular free energy landscape of such sequence from rupture force kinetic studies. Finally we combine such kinetic studies with experimental investigations of the Crooks fluctuation relation to derive the free energy of formation of the hairpin at zero force.,Human
We investigate irreversibility and dissipation in single molecules that cooperatively fold/unfold in a two state manner under the action of mechanical force. We apply path thermodynamics to derive analytical expressions for the average dissipated work and the average hopping number in two state systems. It is shown how these quantities only depend on two parameters that characterize the folding/unfolding kinetics of the molecule: the fragility and the coexistence hopping rate. The latter has to be rescaled to take into account the appropriate experimental setup. Finally we carry out pulling experiments with optical tweezers in a specifically designed DNA hairpin that shows two-state cooperative folding. We then use these experimental results to validate our theoretical predictions.,Human
"We discuss multiscale simulations of long biopolymer translocation through wide nanopores that can accommodate multiple polymer strands. The simulations provide clear evidence of folding quantization, namely, the translocation proceeds through multi-folded configurations characterized by a well-defined integer number of folds. As a consequence, the translocation time acquires a dependence on the average folding number, which results in a deviation from the single-exponent power-law characterizing single-file translocation through narrow pores. The mechanism of folding quantization allows polymers above a threshold length (approximately $1,000$ persistence lengths for double-stranded DNA) to exhibit cooperative behavior and as a result to translocate noticeably faster.",Human
"We present a non-neutral stochastic model for the dynamics taking place in a meta-community ecosystems in presence of migration. The model provides a framework for describing the emergence of multiple ecological scenarios and behaves in two extreme limits either as the unified neutral theory of biodiversity or as the Bak-Sneppen model. Interestingly, the model shows a condensation phase transition where one species becomes the dominant one, the diversity in the ecosystems is strongly reduced and the ecosystem is non-stationary. This phase transition extend the principle of competitive exclusion to open ecosystems and might be relevant for the study of the impact of invasive species in native ecologies.",Human
"Large protein assemblies, such as virus capsids, may be coarse-grained as a set of rigid domains linked by generalized (rotational and stretching) harmonic springs. We present a method to obtain the elastic parameters and overdamped dynamics for these springs from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of one pair of domains at a time. The computed relaxation times of this pair give a consistency check for the simulation, and (using a fluctuation-dissipation relationship) we find the corrective force needed to null systematic drifts. As a first application we predict the stiffness of an HIV capsid layer and the relaxation time for its breathing mode.",Human
"Neural feedback-triads consisting of two feedback loops with a non-reciprocal lateral connection from one loop to the other are ubiquitous in the brain. We show analytically that the dynamics of this network topology are determined by two algebraic combinations of its five synaptic weights. Thus different weight settings can generate equivalent network dynamics. Exploration of network activity over the two-dimensional parameter space demonstrates the importance of the non-reciprocal lateral connection and reveals intricate behavior involving continuous transitions between qualitatively different activity states. In addition, we show that the response to periodic inputs is narrowly tuned around a center frequency determined by the two effective synaptic parameters.",Human
"Developmental transcriptional networks in plants and animals operate in both space and time. To understand these transcriptional networks it is essential to obtain whole-genome expression data at high spatiotemporal resolution. Substantial amounts of spatial and temporal microarray expression data previously have been obtained for the Arabidopsis root; however, these two dimensions of data have not been integrated thoroughly. Complicating this integration is the fact that these data are heterogeneous and incomplete, with observed expression levels representing complex spatial or temporal mixtures. Given these partial observations, we present a novel method for reconstructing integrated high resolution spatiotemporal data. Our method is based on a new iterative algorithm for finding approximate roots to systems of bilinear equations.",Human
"We introduce a robust, error-tolerant adaptive training algorithm for generalized learning paradigms in high-dimensional superposed quantum networks, or \emph{adaptive quantum networks}. The formalized procedure applies standard backpropagation training across a coherent ensemble of discrete topological configurations of individual neural networks, each of which is formally merged into appropriate linear superposition within a predefined, decoherence-free subspace. Quantum parallelism facilitates simultaneous training and revision of the system within this coherent state space, resulting in accelerated convergence to a stable network attractor under consequent iteration of the implemented backpropagation algorithm. Parallel evolution of linear superposed networks incorporating backpropagation training provides quantitative, numerical indications for optimization of both single-neuron activation functions and optimal reconfiguration of whole-network quantum structure.",Human
"We present a macroscopic theory of electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics based on the laws of motion that govern atomic and molecular motion. The theory is an application of Zwanzig-Mori projection operators. The result is a simple equation of motion that has the form of a generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which requires knowledge only of macroscopic properties. The macroscopic properties can be extracted from experimental data by one of two possible variational principles. These variational principles are our principal contribution to the formalism. Potential applications are discussed, including applications to the theory of critical phenomena in the brain, Granger causality and Kalman filters.",Human
"Empirical observations suggest that in pure even-aged forests, the mean diameter of forest trees (D, diameter at breast height, 1.3 m above ground) tends to remain a constant proportion of stand height (H, average height of the largest trees in a stand) divided by the logarithm of stand density (N, number of trees per hectare): D = beta (H-1.3)/Ln(N). Thinning causes a relatively small and temporary change in the slope beta, the magnitude and duration of which depends on the nature of the thinning. This relationship may provide a robust predictor of growth in situations where scarce data and resources preclude more sophisticated modelling approaches.",Human
"Morphogen profiles play a vital role in biology by specifying position in embryonic development. However, the factors that influence the shape of a morphogen profile remain poorly understood. Since morphogens should provide precise positional information, one significant factor is the robustness of the profile to noise. We compare three classes of morphogen profiles (linear, exponential, algebraic) to see which is most precise when subject to both external embryo-to-embryo fluctuations and internal fluctuations due to intrinsically random processes such as diffusion. We find that both the kinetic parameters and the overall gradient shape (e.g. exponential versus algebraic) can be optimised to generate maximally precise positional information.",Human
"Protein amyloid fibrils are a form of linear protein aggregates that are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we study the dynamics of amyloid fibril elongation by performing Langevin dynamic simulations on a coarse-grained model of peptides. Our simulation results suggest that the elongation process is dominated by a series of local minimum due to frustration in monomer-fibril interactions. This rugged energy landscape picture indicates that the amount of recycling of monomers at the fibrils' ends before being fibrilized is substantially reduced in comparison to the conventional two-step elongation model. This picture, along with other predictions discussed, can be tested with current experimental techniques.",Human
"A model of pattern formation in living systems is presented. The pattern is achieved by the sequential interaction of two signaling pathways. The coupling of the pattern to the (thick) epithelial sheet changes is given, when the Gauss curvature'K'enters. The model suggests a novel point-like placement for organs such as eyes, antennae, limbs, and wings. In the case of plant patterns, 'leaf' outgrowths from a stem are predicted to be under the control of a yet to be discovered ""master regulatiory gene"", analogous to the animal case, when various outgrowths from the animal body are generally accompanied by activation of the 'distal-less' (Dll) gene.",Human
"We present a rigorous procedure to derive coarse-grained red blood cell (RBC) models, which lead to accurate mechanical properties of realistic RBCs. Based on a semi-analytic theory linear and non-linear elastic properties of the RBC membrane can be matched with those obtained in optical tweezers stretching experiments. In addition, we develop a nearly stress-free model which avoids a number of pitfalls of existing RBC models, such as non-biconcave equilibrium shape and dependence of RBC mechanical properties on the triangulation quality. The proposed RBC model is suitable for use in many existing numerical methods, such as Lattice Boltzmann, Multiparticle Collision Dynamics, Immersed Boundary, etc.",Human
"We study the dynamics of correlation and variance in systems under the load of environmental factors. A universal effect in ensembles of similar systems under the load of similar factors is described: in crisis, typically, even before obvious symptoms of crisis appear, correlation increases, and, at the same time, variance (and volatility) increases too. This effect is supported by many experiments and observations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial time series.   A general approach to the explanation of the effect through dynamics of individual adaptation of similar non-interactive individuals to a similar system of external factors is developed. Qualitatively, this approach follows Selye's idea about adaptation energy.",Human
"When an infectious disease strikes a population, the number of newly reported cases is often the only available information that one can obtain during early stages of the outbreak. An important goal of early outbreak analysis is to obtain a reliable estimate for the basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, from the limited information available. We present a novel method that enables us to make a reliable real-time estimate of the reproduction number at a much earlier stage compared to other available methods. Our method takes into account the possibility that a disease has a wide distribution of infectious period and that the degree distribution of the contact network is heterogeneous. We validate our analytical framework with numerical simulations.",Human
"We construct a tractable model to describe the rate at which a knotted polymer is ejected from a spherical capsid via a small pore. Knots are too large to fit through the pore and must reptate to the end of the polymer for ejection to occur. The reptation of knots is described by symmetric exclusion on the line, with the internal capsid pressure represented by an additional biased particle that drives knots to the end of the chain. We compute the exact ejection speed for a finite number of knots L and find that it scales as 1/L. We also construct a continuum theory for many knots that matches the exact discrete theory for large L.",Human
"The promotion of cooperation on spatial lattices is an important issue in evolutionary game theory. This effect clearly depends on the update rule: it diminishes with stochastic imitative rules whereas it increases with unconditional imitation. To study the transition between both regimes, we propose a new evolutionary rule, which stochastically combines unconditional imitation with another imitative rule. We find that, surprinsingly, in many social dilemmas this rule yields higher cooperative levels than any of the two original ones. This nontrivial effect occurs because the basic rules induce a separation of timescales in the microscopic processes at cluster interfaces. The result is robust in the space of 2x2 symmetric games, on regular lattices and on scale-free networks.",Human
"We calculate the optimality of a doublet precursor to the canonical genetic code with respect to mitigating the effects of point mutations and compare our results to corresponding ones for the canonical genetic code. We find that the proposed precursor has much less optimality than that of the canonical code. Our results render unlikely the notion that the doublet precursor was an intermediate state in the evolution of the canonical genetic code. These findings support the notion that code optimality reflects evolutionary dynamics, and that if such a doublet code originally had a biochemical significance, it arose before the emergence of translation.",Human
"The structure of networks that provide optimal transport properties has been investigated in a variety of contexts. While many different formulations of this problem have been considered, it is recurrently found that optimal networks are trees. It is shown here that this result is contingent on the assumption of a stationary flow through the network. When time variations or fluctuations are allowed for, a different class of optimal structures is found, which share the hierarchical organization of trees yet contain loops. The transitions between different network topologies as the parameters of the problem vary are examined. These results may have strong implications for the structure and formation of natural networks, as is illustrated by the example of leaf venation networks.",Human
"We study the effect of extrinsic noise in metabolic networks. We introduce external random fluctuations at the kinetic level, and show how these lead to a stochastic generalization of standard Metabolic Control Analysis. While Summation and Connectivity Theorems hold true in presence of extrinsic noise, control coefficients incorporate its effect through an explicit dependency on the noise intensity. New elasticities and response coefficients are also defined. Accordingly, the concept of control by noise is introduced as a way of tuning the systemic behaviour of metabolisms. We argue that this framework holds for intrinsic noise too, when time-scale separation is present in the system.",Human
"Increasingly, biologists are constructing evolutionary trees on large numbers of overlapping sets of taxa, and then combining them into a `supertree' that classifies all the taxa. In this paper, we ask how much coverage of the total set of taxa is required by these subsets in order to ensure we have enough information to reconstruct the supertree uniquely. We describe two results - a combinatorial characterization of the covering subsets to ensure that at most one supertree can be constructed from the smaller trees (whatever trees these may be) and a more liberal analysis that asks only that the supertree is highly likely to be uniquely specified by the tree structure on the covering subsets.",Human
"We demonstrate that demographic noise can induce persistent spatial pattern formation and temporal oscillations in the Levin-Segel predator-prey model for plankton-herbivore population dynamics. Although the model exhibits a Turing instability in mean field theory, demographic noise greatly enlarges the region of parameter space where pattern formation occurs. To distinguish between patterns generated by fluctuations and those present at the mean field level in real ecosystems, we calculate the power spectrum in the noise-driven case and predict the presence of fat tails not present in the mean field case. These results may account for the prevalence of large-scale ecological patterns, beyond that expected from traditional non-stochastic approaches.",Human
"Characterizing the capabilities, criticalities and response to perturbations of genome-scale metabolic networks is a basic problem with important applications. A key question concerns the identification of the potentially most harmful knockouts. The integration of combinatorial methods with sampling techniques to explore the space of viable flux states may provide crucial insights on this issue. We assess the replaceability of every metabolic conversion in the human red blood cell by enumerating the alternative paths from substrate to product, obtaining a complete map of the potential damage of single enzymopathies. Sampling the space of optimal flux states in the healthy and in the mutated cell reveals both correlations and complementarity between topologic and dynamical aspects.",Human
"We consider a model of bilayer lipid membrane with bola-lipids. The bola-lipid is modeled by linking tails of the hydrophobic chains in the opposite monolayers within bilayer as a first approximation. A number of thermodynamical characteristics are calculated analytically and compared with the ones of a regular membrane without chains linkage. Pronounced difference between lateral pressure profiles at the layers interface for linked and regular bilayer models is found. In the linked case, the lateral pressure mid-plane peak disappears, while the free energy per chain increases. We have also calculated distribution of the orientaional order parameter of linked chains across the bilayer, and found it is in contrast with the usual lipids case.",Human
"A novel model of biological organisms is advanced, treating an organism as a self-consistent system subject to a pathogen flux. The principal novelty of the model is that it describes not some parts, but a biological organism as a whole. The organism is modeled by a five-dimensional dynamical system. The organism homeostasis is described by the evolution equations for five interacting components: healthy cells, ill cells, innate immune cells, specific immune cells, and pathogens. The stability analysis demonstrates that, in a wide domain of the parameter space, the system exhibits robust structural stability. There always exist four stable stationary solutions characterizing four qualitatively differing states of the organism: alive state, boundary state, critical state, and dead state.",Human
"We study the effect of migration between coupled populations, or patches, on the stability properties of multistrain disease dynamics. The epidemic model used in this work displays a Hopf bifurcation to oscillations in a single well mixed population. It is shown numerically that migration between two non-identical patches stabilizes the endemic steady state, delaying the onset of large amplitude outbreaks and reducing the total number of infections. This result is motivated by analyzing generic Hopf bifurcations with different frequencies and with diffusive coupling between them. Stabilization of the steady state is again seen, indicating that our observation in the full multistrain model is based on qualitative characteristics of the dynamics rather than on details of the disease model.",Human
"We study a two-type branching process which provides excellent description of experimental data on cell dynamics in skin tissue (Clayton et al., 2007). The model involves only a single type of progenitor cell, and does not require support from a self-renewed population of stem cells. The progenitor cells divide and may differentiate into post-mitotic cells. We derive an exact solution of this model in terms of generating functions for the total number of cells, and for the number of cells of different types. We also deduce large time asymptotic behaviors drawing on our exact results, and on an independent diffusion approximation.",Human
"It has been proven that the accessibility of the target sites has a critical influence for miRNA and siRNA. In this paper, we present a program, rip2.0, not only the energetically most favorable targets site based on the hybrid-probability, but also a statistical sampling structure to illustrate the statistical characterization and representation of the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA-RNA interaction structures. The outputs are retrieved via backtracing an improved dynamic programming solution for the partition function based on the approach of Huang et al. (Bioinformatics). The $O(N^6)$ time and $O(N^4)$ space algorithm is implemented in C (available from \url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/rip2.html})",Human
"We analyze deficiencies of commonly used Coulomb approximations in Generalized Born solvation energy calculation models and report a development of a new fast surface-based method (FSBE) for numerical calculations of the solvation energy of biomolecules with charged groups. The procedure is only a few percents wrong for molecular configurations of arbitrary sizes, provides explicit values for the reaction field potential at any point of the molecular interior, water polarization at the surface of the molecule, both the solvation energy value and its derivatives suitable for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The method works well both for large and small molecules and thus gives stable energy differences for quantities such as solvation energies contributions to a molecular complex formation.",Human
"In people infected with HIV the RNA viral load is a good predictor of the rate of loss of CD4 cells at a population level but there is still great variability in the rate of decline of CD4 cells among individuals. Here we show that the pre-infection distribution of CD4 cell counts and the distribution of survival times together account for 87% of the variability in the observed rate of decline of CD4 cells among individuals. The challenge is to understand the variation in CD4 levels, among populations and individuals, and to establish the determinants of survival of which viral load may be the most important.",Human
"We introduce a new way to study molecular evolution within well-established Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, showing that for a broad class of fitness landscapes it is possible to derive dynamics analytically within the $1/N$-accuracy, where $N$ is genome length. For smooth and monotonic fitness function this approach gives two dynamical phases: smooth dynamics, and discontinuous dynamics. The latter phase arises naturally with no explicit singular fitness function, counter-intuitively. The Hamilton-Jacobi method yields straightforward analytical results for the models that utilize fitness as a function of Hamming distance from a reference genome sequence. We also show the way in which this method gives dynamical phase structure for multi-peak fitness.",Human
"We report a development of a new fast surface-based method for numerical calculations of solvation energy of biomolecules with a large number of charged groups. The procedure scales linearly with the system size both in time and memory requirements, is only a few percent wrong for any molecular configurations of arbitrary sizes, gives explicit value for the reaction field potential at any point, provides both the solvation energy and its derivatives suitable for Molecular Dynamics simulations. The method works well both for large and small molecules and thus gives stable energy differences for quantities such as solvation energies of molecular complex formation.",Human
"Gaussian white noise is frequently used to model fluctuations in physical systems. In Fokker-Planck theory, this leads to a vanishing probability density near the absorbing boundary of threshold models. Here we derive the boundary condition for the stationary density of a first-order stochastic differential equation for additive finite-grained Poisson noise and show that the response properties of threshold units are qualitatively altered. Applied to the integrate-and-fire neuron model, the response turns out to be instantaneous rather than exhibiting low-pass characteristics, highly non-linear, and asymmetric for excitation and inhibition. The novel mechanism is exhibited on the network level and is a generic property of pulse-coupled systems of threshold units.",Human
"We consider the optimal dynamics in the infinite population evolution models with general symmetric fitness landscape. The search of optimal evolution trajectories are complicated due to sharp transitions (like shock waves) in evolution dynamics with smooth fitness landscapes, which exist even in case of popular quadratic fitness. We found exact analytical solutions for discontinuous dynamics at the large genome length limit.   We found the optimal mutation rates for the fixed fitness landscape. The single peak fitness landscape gives the fastest dynamics to send the vast majority of the population from the initial sequence to the neighborhood of the final sequence.",Human
"Non-extensive statistical physics has allowed to generalize mathematical functions such as exponential and logarithms. The same framework is used to generalize sum and product so that the operations allow a more fluid way to work with mathematical expressions emerging from non-additive formulation of statistical physics. In this work we employ the generalization of the exponential, logarithm and product to obtain a formula for the survival fraction corresponding to the application of several radiation doses on a living tissue. Also we provide experimental recommendations to determine the universal characteristics of living tissues in interaction with radiation. These results have a potential application in radiobiology and radiation oncology.",Human
"Recent discoveries show steady improvements in life expectancy during modern decades. Does this support that humans continue to live longer in future? We recently put forward the maximum survival tendency, as found in survival curves of industrialized countries, which is described by extended Weibull model with age-dependent stretched exponent. The maximum survival tendency suggests that human survival dynamics may possess its intrinsic limit, beyond which survival is inevitably forbidden. Based on such tendency, we develop the model and explore the patterns in the maximum lifespan limits from industrialized countries during recent three decades. This analysis strategy is simple and useful to interpret the complicated human survival dynamics.",Human
"Recent advances in biochemical computing, i.e., information processing with cascades of primarily enzymatic reactions realizing computing gates, such as AND, OR, etc., as well as progress in networking these gates and coupling of the resulting systems to smart/responsive electrodes for output readout, have opened new biosensing opportunities. Here we survey existing enabling research results, as well as ideas and research avenues for future development of a new paradigm of digitally operating biosensors logically processing multiple biochemical signals through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular reactions, yielding the final output signals as YES/NO responses. Such systems can lead to high-fidelity biosensing compared to common single or parallel sensing devices.",Human
"The explanation is that in aortic tissue (both diseased and nondiseased) a BAK1 pseudogene is expressed; while in the matching blood samples the actual BAK1 gene is expressed. This explanation was reached after we realized that BAK1 has two edited copies in human genome. These copies are probably BAK1 pseudogenes. One copy belongs to chromosome 11 (NG_005599.3) and the other to chromosome 20 (NC_000850.5). The first copy has frameshifts which means that probably it does not express any functional protein; by other hand, the chromosome 20 copy has no frameshifts and what is more important contains all the reported polymorphisms.",Human
"Flying insects execute aerial maneuvers through subtle manipulations of their wing motions. Here, we measure the free flight kinematics of fruit flies and determine how they modulate their wing pitching to induce sharp turns. By analyzing the torques these insects exert to pitch their wings, we infer that the wing hinge acts as a torsional spring that passively resists the wing's tendency to flip in response to aerodynamic and inertial forces. To turn, the insects asymmetrically change the spring rest angles to generate rowing motions of their wings. Thus, insects can generate these maneuvers using only a slight active actuation that biases their wing motion.",Human
"Many physical and chemical processes, such as folding of biopolymers, are best described as dynamics on large combinatorial energy landscapes. A concise approximate description of dynamics is obtained by partitioning the micro-states of the landscape into macro-states. Since most landscapes of interest are not tractable analytically, the probabilities of transitions between macro-states need to be extracted numerically from the microscopic ones, typically by full enumeration of the state space. Here we propose to approximate transition probabilities by a Markov chain Monte-Carlo method. For landscapes of the number partitioning problem and an RNA switch molecule we show that the method allows for accurate probability estimates with significantly reduced computational cost.",Human
"Modern high-throughput gene perturbation screens are key technologies at the forefront of genetic research. Combined with rich phenotypic descriptors they enable researchers to observe detailed cellular reactions to experimental perturbations on a genome-wide scale. This review surveys the current state-of-the-art in analyzing perturbation screens from a network point of view. We describe approaches to make the step from the parts list to the wiring diagram by using phenotypes for network inference and integrating them with complementary data sources. The first part of the review describes methods to analyze one- or low-dimensional phenotypes like viability or reporter activity; the second part concentrates on high-dimensional phenotypes showing global changes in cell morphology, transcriptome or proteome.",Human
"We adapt a biomechanical argument of Rashevsky, which places limits on the stress experienced by a torso supported by the legs, to deduce that body mass $m$ of growing children should scale as the $p$th power of height $h$ with $7/3<p<8/3$. Further arguments based on stability and heat loss suggest that $p$ should be close to 8/3. The arguments are extended to suggest that waist circumference $w$ should scale as $h^q$ with $q$ near the lower end of $2/3\leq q \leq 1$. Data from Hong Kong and British children are consistent with these hypotheses.",Human
"Microtubules are filament-shaped, polymeric proteins (~25 nm in diameter) involved in cellular structure and organization. We demonstrate the imaging of individual microtubules using a conventional bright-field microscope, without any additional phase or polarization optics. Light scattered by microtubules is discriminated through extensive use of digital image-processing, thus removing background, reducing noise and enhancing contrast. The setup builds on a commercial microscope, with the inclusion of a minimal and inexpensive set of components, suitable for implementation in the student laboratory. We show how this technique can be applied to a demonstrative biophysical assay, by tracking the motions of microtubules driven by the motor protein kinesin.",Human
"Parts of DNA sequences known as exons and introns play very different role in coding and storage of genetic information. Here we show that their conducting properties are also very different. Taking into account long-range correlations among four basic nucleotides that form double-stranded DNA sequence, we calculate electron localization length for exon and intron regions. Analyzing different DNA molecules, we obtain that the exons have narrow bands of extended states, unlike the introns where all the states are well localized. The band of extended states is due to a specific form of the binary correlation function of the sequence of basic DNA nucleotides.",Human
"I tackle the problem of partitioning a sequence into homogeneous segments, where homogeneity is defined by a set of Markov models. The problem is to study the likelihood that a sequence is divided into a given number of segments. Here, the moments of this likelihood are computed through an efficient algorithm. Unlike methods involving Hidden Markov Models, this algorithm does not require probability transitions between the models. Among many possible usages of the likelihood, I present a maximum \textit{a posteriori} probability criterion to predict the number of homogeneous segments into which a sequence can be divided, and an application of this method to find CpG islands.",Human
"The system of partial differential equations describing tumor-immune dynamics with angiogenesis taken into account is presented. For spatially homogeneous case, the steady state analysis of the model is carried out. The effects of single photodynamic impact are numerically simulated. In the case of strong immune response we found that the photodynamic therapy (PDT) gives rise to the substantial shrinkage of tumor size which is accompanied by the increase of interleukin-2 concentration. On the contrary, the photodynamic stimulation of weak immune response is shown to be insufficient to reduce the tumor. These findings indicate the important role of anti-cancer immune response in the long-term tumor control after PDT.",Human
"The origin of photodamage of single cells confined in laser tweezers is determined by comparison of action spectra with these recorded for a photoinduced response of cell populations. Triplet-singlet transitions in dissolved oxygen provide a common cause of both phenomena. Such transitions are forbidden in isolated O2 molecules, but occur in solutions due to the formation of temporary oxygen-solvent complexes. In dependence on the photon energy oxygen molecules may be excited alone or in combination with roto-vibrational excitations in H2O. The photodamage is a consequence of a toxic action produced by the singlet oxygen 1O2 (1.DELTA.gO2.).",Human
"One of the most striking effect of fluctuations in evolutionary game theory is the possibility for mutants to fixate (take over) an entire population. Here, we generalize a recent WKB-based theory to study fixation in evolutionary games under non-vanishing selection, and investigate the relation between selection intensity w and demographic (random) fluctuations. This allows the accurate treatment of large fluctuations and yields the probability and mean times of fixation beyond the weak selection limit. The power of the theory is demonstrated on prototypical models of cooperation dilemmas with multiple absorbing states. Our predictions compare excellently with numerical simulations and, for finite w, significantly improve over those of the Fokker-Planck approximation.",Human
"The problem of DNA-DNA interaction mediated by divalent counterions is studied using computer simulation. Although divalent counterions cannot condense free DNA molecules in solution, we show that if DNA configurational entropy is restricted, divalent counterions can cause DNA reentrant condensation similar to that caused by tri- or tetra-valent counterions. DNA-DNA interaction is strongly repulsive at small or large counterion concentration and is negligible or slightly attractive for a concentration in between. Implications of our results to experiments of DNA ejection from bacteriophages are discussed. The quantitative result serves to understand electrostatic effects in other experiments involving DNA and divalent counterions.",Human
"A new type of resonant light absorption by a small particle (nanocluster) is reported. The problem cannot be described within the commonly used dipole scattering approximation and should be studied with methods based upon the exact Mie solution. It is shown that the absorption cross-section has giant maxima realized at small values of the imaginary part of the complex dielectric permittivity of the particle. The maxima are situated in the vicinity of the plasmon (polariton) resonances and correspond to the regions where the dissipative damping equals the radiative one. The case is similar to the recently introduced anomalous scattering [PRL vol. 97, 263902 (2006)] and exhibits similar peculiarities.",Human
"Genetically identical cells under the same environmental conditions can show strong variations in protein copy numbers due to inherently stochastic events in individual cells. We here develop a theoretical framework to address how variations in enzyme abundance affect the collective kinetics of metabolic reactions observed within a population of cells. Kinetic parameters measured at the cell population level are shown to be systematically deviated from those of single cells, even within populations of homogeneous parameters. Because of these considerations, Michaelis-Menten kinetics can even be inappropriate to apply at the population level. Our findings elucidate a novel origin of discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro kinetics, and offer potential utility for analysis of single-cell metabolomic data.",Human
"Biochemical computing is an emerging field of unconventional computing that attempts to process information with biomolecules and biological objects using digital logic. In this work we survey filtering in general, in biochemical computing, and summarize the experimental realization of an AND logic gate with sigmoid response in one of the inputs. The logic gate is realized with electrode-immobilized glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme that catalyzes a reaction corresponding to the Boolean AND functions. A kinetic model is also developed and used to evaluate the extent to which the performance of the experimentally realized logic gate is close to optimal.",Human
"In this work, we study the adhesion of multi-component vesicle membrane to both flat and curved substrates, based on the conventional Helfrich bending energy for multi-component vesicles and adhesion potentials of different forms. A phase field formulation is used to describe the different components of the vesicle. For the axisymmetric case, a number of representative equilibrium vesicle shapes are computed and some energy diagrams are presented which reveal the dependence of the calculated shapes and solution branches on various parameters including both bending moduli and spontaneous curvatures as well as the adhesion potential constants. Our computation also confirms a recent experimental observation that the adhesion effect may promote phase separation in two-component vesicle membranes.",Human
"Many types of cells can sense external ligand concentrations with cell-surface receptors at extremely high accuracy. Interestingly, ligand-bound receptors are often internalized, a process also known as receptor-mediated endocytosis. While internalization is involved in a vast number of important functions for the life of a cell, it was recently also suggested to increase the accuracy of sensing ligand as the overcounting of the same ligand molecules is reduced. Here we show, by extending simple ligand-receptor models to out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics, that internalization increases the accuracy with which cells can measure ligand concentrations in the external environment. Comparison with experimental rates of real receptors demonstrates that our model has indeed biological significance.",Human
"Numerical simulations of hydrated proteins show that protein hydration shells are polarized into a ferroelectric cluster with a large magnitude of its average dipole moment. The emergence of this new mesophase dramatically alters the statistics of electrostatic fluctuations at the protein/water interface. The linear-response relation between the average electrostatic potential and its variance breaks down, with the breadth of the electrostatic noise far exceeding the expectations of the linear response theories. The dynamics of these non-Gaussian electrostatic fluctuations are dominated by a slow (~ 1 ns) component which freezes in at the temperature of dynamical transition of proteins.",Human
"We analyze the effects of noise correlations in the input to, or among, BCM neurons using the Wigner semicircular law to construct random, positive-definite symmetric correlation matrices and compute their eigenvalue distributions. In the finite dimensional case, we compare our analytic results with numerical simulations and show the effects of correlations on the lifetimes of synaptic strengths in various visual environments. These correlations can be due either to correlations in the noise from the input LGN neurons, or correlations in the variability of lateral connections in a network of neurons. In particular, we find that for fixed dimensionality, a large noise variance can give rise to long lifetimes of synaptic strengths. This may be of physiological significance.",Human
"We study the role of the dimer structure of light-harvesting complex II (LH2) in excitation transfer from the LH2 (without a reaction center (RC)) to the LH1 (surrounding the RC), or from the LH2 to another LH2. The excited and un-excited states of a bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) are modeled by a quasi-spin. In the framework of quantum open system theory, we represent the excitation transfer as the total leakage of the LH2 system and then calculate the transfer efficiency and average transfer time. For different initial states with various quantum superposition properties, we study how the dimerization of the B850 BChl ring can enhance the transfer efficiency and shorten the average transfer time.",Human
"Intracellular transmission of information via chemical and transcriptional networks is thwarted by a physical limitation: the finite copy number of the constituent chemical species introduces unavoidable intrinsic noise. Here we provide a method for solving for the complete probabilistic description of intrinsically noisy oscillatory driving. We derive and numerically verify a number of simple scaling laws. Unlike in the case of measuring a static quantity, response to an oscillatory driving can exhibit a resonant frequency which maximizes information transmission. Further, we show that the optimal regulatory design is dependent on the biophysical constraints (i.e., the allowed copy number and response time). The resulting phase diagram illustrates under what conditions threshold regulation outperforms linear regulation.",Human
"The collective dynamics of coupled two-dimensional chaotic maps on complex networks is known to exhibit a rich variety of emergent properties which crucially depend on the underlying network topology. We investigate the collective motion of Chirikov standard maps interacting with time delay through directed links of Gene Regulatory Network of bacterium Escherichia Coli. Departures from strongly chaotic behavior of the isolated maps are studied in relation to different coupling forms and strengths. At smaller coupling intensities the network induces stable and coherent emergent dynamics. The unstable behavior appearing with increase of coupling strength remains confined within a connected sub-network. For the appropriate coupling, network exhibits statistically robust self-organized dynamics in a weakly chaotic regime.",Human
"With the goal of understanding the intricate behavior and dynamics of collections of neurons, we present superconducting circuits containing Josephson junctions that model biologically realistic neurons. These ""Josephson junction neurons"" reproduce many characteristic behaviors of biological neurons such as action potentials, refractory periods, and firing thresholds. They can be coupled together in ways that mimic electrical and chemical synapses. Using existing fabrication technologies, large interconnected networks of Josephson junction neurons would operate fully in parallel. They would be orders of magnitude faster than both traditional computer simulations and biological neural networks. Josephson junction neurons provide a new tool for exploring long-term large-scale dynamics for networks of neurons.",Human
"The electroencephalographic (EEG) data intracerebrally recorded from 20 epileptic humans with different brain origins of focal epilepsies or types of seizures, ages and sexes are investigated (nearly 700 million data). Multi channel univariate amplitude analyses are performed and it is shown that time dependent Shannon entropies can be used to predict focal epileptic seizure onsets in different epileptogenic brain zones of different patients. Formations or time evolutions of the synchronizations in the brain signals from epileptogenic or non epileptogenic areas of the patients in ictal interval or inter-ictal interval are further investigated employing spatial or temporal differences of the entropies.",Human
"We apply the approach of the Google matrix, used in computer science and World Wide Web, to description of properties of neuronal networks. The Google matrix ${\bf G}$ is constructed on the basis of neuronal network of a brain model discussed in PNAS {\bf 105}, 3593 (2008). We show that the spectrum of eigenvalues of ${\bf G}$ has a gapless structure with long living relaxation modes. The PageRank of the network becomes delocalized for certain values of the Google damping factor $\alpha$. The properties of other eigenstates are also analyzed. We discuss further parallels and similarities between the World Wide Web and neuronal networks.",Human
"The infection pathway of virus in cytoplasm of a living cell is studied from the viewpoint of diffusion theory. The cytoplasm plays a role of a medium for stochastic motion of the virus contained in the endosome as well as the free virus. It is experimentally known that the exponent of anomalous diffusion fluctuates in localized areas of the cytoplasm. Here, generalizing fractional kinetic theory, such fluctuations are described in terms of the exponent locally distributed over the cytoplasm, and a theoretical proposition is presented for its statistical form. The proposed fluctuations may be examined in an experiment of heterogeneous diffusion in the infection pathway.",Human
"Extinction of an epidemic or a species is a rare event that occurs due to a large, rare stochastic fluctuation. Although the extinction process is dynamically unstable, it follows an optimal path that maximizes the probability of extinction. We show that the optimal path is also directly related to the finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the underlying dynamical system in that the optimal path displays maximum sensitivity to initial conditions. We consider several stochastic epidemic models, and examine the extinction process in a dynamical systems framework. Using the dynamics of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents as a constructive tool, we demonstrate that the dynamical systems viewpoint of extinction evolves naturally toward the optimal path.",Human
"The Lee Carter modelling framework is widely used because of its simplicity and robustness despite its inability to model specific cohort effects. A large number of extensions have been proposed that model cohort effects but there is no consensus. It is difficult to simultaneously account for cohort effects and age-adjusted improvements and we here test a simple model that accounts for both: we simply add a non age-adjusted cohort component to the Lee Carter framework. This is a trade-off between accuracy and robustness but, for various countries present in the Human Mortality Database and compared to various models, the model accurately fits past mortality data and gives good backtesting projections.",Human
"We introduce a mathematical model of symbiosis between different species by taking into account the influence of each species on the carrying capacities of the others. The modeled entities can pertain to biological and ecological societies or to social, economic and financial societies. Our model includes three basic types: symbiosis with direct mutual interactions, symbiosis with asymmetric interactions, and symbiosis without direct interactions. In all cases, we provide a complete classification of all admissible dynamical regimes. The proposed model of symbiosis turned out to be very rich, as it exhibits four qualitatively different regimes: convergence to stationary states, unbounded exponential growth, finite-time singularity, and finite-time death or extinction of species.",Human
"Slow-wave sleep in mammalians is characterized by a change of large-scale cortical activity currently paraphrased as cortical Up/Down states. A recent experiment demonstrated a bistable collective behaviour in ferret slices, with the remarkable property that the Up states can be switched on and off with pulses, or excitations, of same polarity; whereby the effect of the second pulse significantly depends on the time interval between the pulses. Here we present a simple time discrete model of a neural network that exhibits this type of behaviour, as well as quantitatively reproduces the time-dependence found in the experiments.",Human
"Certain migratory birds can sense the earth's magnetic field. The nature of this process is not yet properly understood. Here we offer a simple explanation according to which birds literally `see' the local magnetic field: Our model relates the well-established radical pair hypothesis to the phenomenon of Haidinger's brush, a capacity to see the polarisation of light. This new picture explains recent surprising experimental data indicating long lifetimes for the radical pair. Moreover there is a clear evolutionary path toward this field sensing mechanism: it is an enhancement of a weak effect that may be present in many species.",Human
"At an optimal value of the noise intensity, the maximum variability in rebound burst durations is observed and referred to as a response stochastic incoherence. A general mechanism underlying this phenomenon is given, being different from those reported so far in excitable systems. It is shown to be determined by (i) the monotonic reduction of the hysteresis responsible for bursting caused by noise and consequent transformation of responses from rebound bursts to single spikes, and (ii) a symmetry breaking in distributions of burst durations caused by the existence of the minimum response length. The phenomenon is studied numerically in a Morris-Lecar model for neurons and its mechanism is explained with the use of canonical models describing hard excitation states.",Human
"We study synchronization of locally coupled noisy phase oscillators which move diffusively in a one-dimensional ring. Together with the disordered and the globally synchronized states, the system also exhibits several wave-like states which display local order. We use a statistical description valid for a large number of oscillators to show that for any finite system there is a critical spatial diffusion above which all wave-like solutions become unstable. Through Langevin simulations, we show that the transition to global synchronization is mediated by the relative size of attractor basins associated to wave-like states. Spatial diffusion disrupts these states and paves the way for the system to attain global synchronization.",Human
"The geometrical coupling between strain and twist in double helices is investigated. Overwinding, where strain leads to further winding, is shown to be a universal property for helices, which are stretched along their longitudinal axis when the initial pitch angle is below the zero-twist angle (39.4 deg). Unwinding occurs at larger pitch angles. The zero-twist angle is the unique pitch angle at the point between overwinding and unwinding, and it is independent of the mechanical properties of the double helix. This suggests the existence of zero-twist structures, i.e. structures that display neither overwinding, nor unwinding under strain. Estimates of the overwinding of DNA, chromatin, and RNA are given.",Human
"In many natural synchronization phenomena, communication between individual elements occurs not directly, but rather through the environment. One of these instances is bacterial quorum sensing, where bacteria release signaling molecules in the environment which in turn are sensed and used for population coordination. Extending this motivation to a general non- linear dynamical system context, this paper analyzes synchronization phenomena in networks where communication and coupling between nodes are mediated by shared dynamical quan- tities, typically provided by the nodes' environment. Our model includes the case when the dynamics of the shared variables themselves cannot be neglected or indeed play a central part. Applications to examples from systems biology illustrate the approach.",Human
"We study the effect that the heterogeneity present among the elements of an ensemble of coupled excitable neurons have on the collective response of the system to an external signal. We have considered two different interaction scenarios, one in which the neurons are diffusively coupled and another in which the neurons interact via pulse-like signals. We found that the type of interaction between the neurons has a crucial role in determining the response of the system to the external modulation. We develop a mean-field theory based on an order parameter expansion that quantitatively reproduces the numerical results in the case of diffusive coupling.",Human
"Metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, firefly algorithm and harmony search are now becoming powerful methods for solving many tough optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a new metaheuristic method, the Bat Algorithm, based on the echolocation behaviour of bats. We also intend to combine the advantages of existing algorithms into the new bat algorithm. After a detailed formulation and explanation of its implementation, we will then compare the proposed algorithm with other existing algorithms, including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm seems much superior to other algorithms, and further studies are also discussed.",Human
"We predict analytically that diagonal correlations of amino acid positions within protein sequences statistically enhance protein propensity for nonspecific binding. We use the term 'promiscuity' to describe such nonspecific binding. Diagonal correlations represent statistically significant repeats of sequence patterns where amino acids of the same type are clustered together. The predicted effect is qualitatively robust with respect to the form of the microscopic interaction potentials and the average amino acid composition. Our analytical results provide an explanation for the enhanced diagonal correlations observed in hubs of eukaryotic organismal proteomes [J. Mol. Biol. 409, 439 (2011)]. We suggest experiments that will allow direct testing of the predicted effect.",Human
"We analyze several aspects of the transport dynamics in the LH1-RC core of purple bacteria, which consists basically in a ring of antenna molecules that transport the energy into a target molecule, the reaction center, placed in the center of the ring. We show that the periodicity of the system plays an important role to explain the relevance of the initial state in the transport efficiency. This picture is modified, and the transport enhanced for any initial state, when considering that molecules have different energies, and when including their interaction with the environment. We study this last situation by using stochastic Schr{\""o}dinger equations, both for Markovian and non-Markovian type of interactions.",Human
"Starting from the hypothesis that the tubulin dimer is a conformationally bistable molecule - fluctuating between a curved and a straight configuration at room temperature - we develop a model for polymorphic dynamics of the microtubule lattice. We show that tubulin bistability consistently explains unusual dynamic fluctuations, the apparent length-stiffness relation of grafted microtubules and the curved-helical appearance of microtubules in general. Analyzing experimental data we conclude that taxol stabilized microtubules exist in highly cooperative yet strongly fluctuating helical states. When clamped by the end the microtubule undergoes an unusual zero energy motion - in its effect reminiscent of a limited rotational hinge.",Human
"Plasmodium of \emph{Physarum polycephalum} is a single cell visible by unaided eye. On a non-nutrient substrate the plasmodium propagates as a traveling localization, as a compact wave-fragment of protoplasm. The plasmodium-localization travels in its originally predetermined direction for a substantial period of time even when no gradient of chemo-attractants is present. We utilize this property of \emph{Physarum} localizations to design a two-input two-output Boolean logic gates $<x, y> \to <xy, x+y>$ and $<x, y> \to <x, bar{x}y>$. We verify the designs in laboratory experiments and computer simulations. We cascade the logical gates into one-bit half-adder and simulate its functionality.",Human
"Transport properties of concentrated electrolytes have been analyzed using classical molecular dynamics simulations with the algorithms and parameters typical of simulations describing complex electrokinetic phenomena. The electrical conductivity and transport numbers of electrolytes containing monovalent (KCl), divalent (MgCl$_2$), a mixture of both (KCl + MgCl$_2$), and trivalent (LaCl$_3$) cations have been obtained from simulations of the electrolytes in electric fields of different magnitude. The results obtained for different simulation parameters have been discussed and compared with experimental measurements of our own and from the literature. The electroosmotic flow of water molecules induced by the ionic current in the different cases has been calculated and interpreted with the help of the hydration properties extracted from the simulations.",Human
"The paper deals with a theoretical investigation of the peristaltic transport of a physiological fluid in a porous asymmetric channel under the action of a magnetic field. The stream function, pressure gradient and axial velocity are studied by using appropriate analytical and numerical techniques. Effects of different physical parameters such as permeability, phase difference, wave amplitude and magnetic parameter on the velocity, pumping characteristics, streamline pattern and trapping are investigated with particular emphasis. The computational results are presented in graphical form. The results are found to be in perfect agreement with those of a previous study carried out for a non-porous channel in the absence of a magnetic field.",Human
"The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies constituted a major advance in genomic studies, offering new prospects in a wide range of applications. We propose a rigorous and flexible algorithmic solution to mapping SOLiD color-space reads to a reference genome. The solution relies on an advanced method of seed design that uses a faithful probabilistic model of read matches and, on the other hand, a novel seeding principle especially adapted to read mapping. Our method can handle both lossy and lossless frameworks and is able to distinguish, at the level of seed design, between SNPs and reading errors. We illustrate our approach by several seed designs and demonstrate their efficiency.",Human
"Autocatalysis is a fundamental concept, used in a wide range of domains. From the most general definition of autocatalysis, that is a process in which a chemical compound is able to catalyze its own formation, several different systems can be described. We detail the different categories of autocatalyses, and compare them on the basis of their mechanistic, kinetic, and dynamic properties. It is shown how autocatalytic patterns can be generated by different systems of chemical reactions. The notion of autocatalysis covering a large variety of mechanistic realisations with very similar behaviors, it is proposed that the key signature of autocatalysis is its kinetic pattern expressed in a mathematical form.",Human
"RNA-RNA binding is an important phenomenon observed for many classes of non-coding RNAs and plays a crucial role in a number of regulatory processes. Recently several MFE folding algorithms for predicting the joint structure of two interacting RNA molecules have been proposed. Here joint structure means that in a diagram representation the intramolecular bonds of each partner are pseudoknot-free, that the intermolecular binding pairs are noncrossing, and that there is no so-called ``zig-zag'' configuration. This paper presents the combinatorics of RNA interaction structures including their generating function, singularity analysis as well as explicit recurrence relations. In particular, our results imply simple asymptotic formulas for the number of joint structures.",Human
"A non-Hermitean extension of paradigmatic Wishart random matrices is introduced to set up a theoretical framework for statistical analysis of (real, complex and real quaternion) stochastic time series representing two ""remote"" complex systems. The first paper in a series provides a detailed spectral theory of non-Hermitean Wishart random matrices composed of complex valued entries. The great emphasis is placed on an asymptotic analysis of the mean eigenvalue density for which we derive, among other results, a complex-plane analogue of the Marchenko-Pastur law. A surprising connection with a class of matrix models previously invented in the context of quantum chromodynamics is pointed out.",Human
"We present theory and experiments for the force-distance curve $F(z_0)$ of an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip (radius $R$) indenting a supported fluid bilayer (thickness $2d$). For realistic conditions the force is dominated by the area compressibility modulus $\kappa_A$ of the bilayer, and, to an excellent approximation, given by $F= \pi \kappa_A R z_0^2/(2d-z_0)^2$. The experimental AFM force curves from coexisting liquid ordered and liquid disordered domains in 3-component lipid bilayers are well-described by our model, and provides $\kappa_A$ in agreement with literature values. The liquid ordered phase has a yield like response that we model by hydrogen bond breaking.",Human
"The intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression can lead to large variability of protein levels across a population of cells. Variability (or noise) in protein distributions can be modulated by cellular mechanisms of gene regulation; in particular, there is considerable interest in understanding the role of post-transcriptional regulation. To address this issue, we propose and analyze a stochastic model for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The analytical solution of the model provides insight into the effects of different mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation on the noise in protein distributions. The results obtained also demonstrate how different sources of intrinsic noise in gene expression can be discriminated based on observations of regulated protein distributions.",Human
"We propose a theoretical formalism, molecular finite automata (MFA), to describe individual proteins as rule-based computing machines. The MFA formalism provides a framework for modeling individual protein behaviors and systems-level dynamics via construction of programmable and executable machines. Models specified within this formalism explicitly represent the context-sensitive dynamics of individual proteins driven by external inputs and represent protein-protein interactions as synchronized machine reconfigurations. Both deterministic and stochastic simulations can be applied to quantitatively compute the dynamics of MFA models. We apply the MFA formalism to model and simulate a simple example of a signal transduction system that involves a MAP kinase cascade and a scaffold protein.",Human
"We describe the structure of the graphs with the smallest average distance and the largest average clustering given their order and size. There is usually a unique graph with the largest average clustering, which at the same time has the smallest possible average distance. In contrast, there are many graphs with the same minimum average distance, ignoring their average clustering. The form of these graphs is shown with analytical arguments. Finally, we measure the sensitivity to rewiring of this architecture with respect to the clustering coefficient, and we devise a method to make these networks more robust with respect to vertex removal.",Human
"Genetic oscillators are a major theme of interest in the emerging field of synthetic biology. Until recently, most work has been carried out using intra-cellular oscillators, but this approach restricts the broader applicability of such systems. Motivated by a desire to develop large-scale, spatially-distributed cell-based computational systems, we present an initial design for a population-level oscillator which uses three different bacterial strains. Our system is based on the client-server model familiar to computer science, and uses quorum sensing for communication between nodes. We present the results of extensive in silico simulation tests, which confirm that our design is both feasible and robust.",Human
"A large amount of population models use the concept of a carrying capacity. Simulated populations are bounded by invoking finite resources through a survival probability, commonly referred to as the Verhulst factor. The fact, however, that resources are not easily accounted for in actual biological systems makes the carrying capacity parameter ill-defined. Henceforth, we deem it essential to consider cases for which the parameter is unnecessary. This work demonstrates the possibility of Verhulst-free steady states using the Penna aging model, with one semelparous birth per adult. Stable populations are obtained by setting a mutation threshold that is higher than the reproduction age.",Human
"We study neural connectivity in cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. We measure the neurons' response to an electric stimulation for gradual lower connectivity, and characterize the size of the giant cluster in the network. The connectivity undergoes a percolation transition described by the critical exponent $\beta \simeq 0.65$. We use a theoretic approach based on bond.percolation on a graph to describe the process of disintegration of the network and extract its statistical properties. Together with numerical simulations we show that the connectivity in the neural culture is local, characterized by a gaussian degree distribution and not a power law on",Human
"One of the major functions of RecA protein in the cell is to bind single-stranded DNA exposed upon damage, thereby triggering the SOS repair response.We present fluorescence anisotropy measurements at the binding onset, showing enhanced DNA length discrimination induced by adenosine triphosphate consumption. Our model explains the observed DNA length sensing as an outcome of out-of equilibrium binding fluctuations, reminiscent of microtubule dynamic instability. The cascade architecture of the binding fluctuations is a generalization of the kinetic proofreading mechanism. Enhancement of precision by an irreversible multistage pathway is a possible design principle in the noisy biological environment.",Human
"Individual Based Models (IBMs) and Agent Based Models (ABMs) have become widely used tools to understand complex biological systems. However, general methods of parameter inference for IBMs are not available. In this paper we show that it is possible to address this problem with a traditional likelihood-based approach, using an example of an IBM developed to describe the spread of Chytridiomycosis in a population of frogs as a case study. We show that if the IBM satisfies certain criteria we can find the likelihood (or posterior) analytically, and use standard computational techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), for parameter inference.",Human
"Gradual disruption of the actin cytoskeleton induces a series of structural shape changes in cells leading to a transformation of cylindrical cell extensions into a periodic chain of ""pearls"". Quantitative measurements of the pearling instability give a square-root behavior for the wavelength as a function of drug concentration. We present a theory that explains these observations in terms of the interplay between rigidity of the submembranous actin shell and tension that is induced by boundary conditions set by adhesion points. The theory allows estimation of the rigidity and thickness of this supporting shell. The same theoretical considerations explain the shape of nonadherent edges in the general case of untreated cells.",Human
"In this paper, we examine the effects of correlated Gaussian noise on a two-dimensional neuronal network that is locally modeled by the Rulkov map. More precisely, we study the effects of the noise correlation on the variations of the mean firing rate and the correlations among neurons versus the noise intensity. Via numerical simulations, we show that the mean firing rate can always be optimized at an intermediate noise intensity, irrespective of the noise correlation. On the other hand, variations of the population coherence with respect to the noise intensity are strongly influenced by the ratio between local and global Gaussian noisy inputs. Biological implications of our findings are also discussed.",Human
"In dilute suspensions of swimming microorganisms the local fluid velocity is a random superposition of the flow fields set up by the individual organisms, which in turn have multipole contributions decaying as inverse powers of distance from the organism. Here we show that the conditions under which the central limit theorem guarantees a Gaussian probability distribution function of velocities are satisfied when the leading force singularity is a Stokeslet, but are not when it is any higher multipole. These results are confirmed by numerical studies and by experiments on suspensions of the alga Volvox carteri, which show that deviations from Gaussianity arise from near-field effects.",Human
In this work we present a mathematical framework that quantifies the gas-exchange processes in the lung. The theory is based on the solution of the one-dimensional diffusion equation on a simplified model of lung septum. Gases dissolved into different compartments of the lung are all treated separately with physiologically important parameters. The model can be applied in magnetic resonance of hyperpolarized xenon for quantification of lung parameters such as surface-to-volume ratio and the air-blood barrier thickness. In general this model provides a description of a broad range of biological exchange processes that are driven by diffusion.,Human
"We study the thermal and mechanical behavior of DNA denaturation in the frame of the mesoscopic Peyrard- Bishop-Dauxois model with the inclusion of solvent interaction. By analyzing the melting transition of a homogeneous A-T sequence, we are able to set suitable values of the parameters of the model and study the formation and stability of bubbles in the system. Then, we focus on the case of the P5 promoter sequence and use the Principal Component Analysis of the trajectories to extract the main information on the dynamical behavior of the system. We find that this analysis method gives an excellent agreement with previous biological results.",Human
"The inner ear achieves a wide dynamic range of responsiveness by mechanically amplifying weak sounds. The enormous mechanical gain reported for the mammalian cochlea, which exceeds a factor of 4,000, poses a challenge for theory. Here we show how such a large gain can result from an interaction between amplification by low-gain hair bundles and a pressure wave: hair bundles can amplify both their displacement per locally applied pressure and the pressure wave itself. A recently proposed ratchet mechanism, in which hair-bundle forces do not feed back on the pressure wave, delineates the two effects. Our analytical calculations with a WKB approximation agree with numerical solutions.",Human
"This paper addresses the statistical significance of structures in random data: Given a set of vectors and a measure of mutual similarity, how likely does a subset of these vectors form a cluster with enhanced similarity among its elements? The computation of this cluster p-value for randomly distributed vectors is mapped onto a well-defined problem of statistical mechanics. We solve this problem analytically, establishing a connection between the physics of quenched disorder and multiple testing statistics in clustering and related problems. In an application to gene expression data, we find a remarkable link between the statistical significance of a cluster and the functional relationships between its genes.",Human
"Radical-ion-pair reactions were recently shown to represent a rich biophysical laboratory for the application of quantum measurement theory methods and concepts. We here show that radical-ion-pair reactions essentially form a non-linear biochemical double slit interferometer. Quantum coherence effects are visible when ""which-path"" information is limited, and the incoherent limit is approached when measurement-induced decoherence sets in. Based on this analogy with the optical double slit experiment we derive and elaborate on the fundamental master equation of spin-selective radical-ion-pair reactions that covers the continuous range from complete incoherence to maximum singlet-triplet coherence.",Human
"Since gene regulatory systems contain sometimes only a small number of molecules, these systems are not described well by macroscopic rate equations; a master equation approach is needed for such cases. We develop an approximation scheme for dealing with the stochasticity of the gene regulatory systems. Using an effective interaction concept, original master equations can be reduced to simpler master equations, which can be solved analytically. We apply the approximation scheme to self-regulating systems with monomer or dimer interactions, and a two-gene system with an exclusive switch. The approximation scheme can recover bistability of the exclusive switch adequately.",Human
"There is substantial interest in the effect of human mobility patterns on opportunistic communications. Inspired by recent work revisiting some of the early evidence for a L\'evy flight foraging strategy in animals, we analyse datasets on human contact from real world traces. By analysing the distribution of inter-contact times on different time scales and using different graphical forms, we find not only the highly skewed distributions of waiting times highlighted in previous studies but also clear circadian rhythm. The relative visibility of these two components depends strongly on which graphical form is adopted and the range of time scales. We use a simple model to reconstruct the observed behaviour and discuss the implications of this for forwarding efficiency.",Human
"Self-organization of proteins in space and time is of crucial importance for the functioning of cellular processes. Often, this organization takes place in the presence of strong random fluctuations due to the small number of molecules involved. We report on stochastic switching of the Min-protein distributions between the two cell halves in short Escherichia coli cells. A computational model provides strong evidence that the macroscopic switching is rooted in microscopic noise on the molecular scale. In longer bacteria, the switching turns into regular oscillations that are required for positioning of the division plane. As the pattern becomes more regular, cell-to-cell variability also lessens, indicating cell length-dependent regulation of Min-protein activity.",Human
"A discrete chemotactic predator-prey model is proposed in which the prey secrets a diffusing chemical which is sensed by the predator and vice versa. Two dynamical states corresponding to catching and escaping are identified and it is shown that steady hunting is unstable. For the escape process, the predator-prey distance is diffusive for short times but exhibits a transient subdiffusive behavior which scales as a power law $t^{1/3}$ with time $t$ and ultimately crosses over to diffusion again. This allows to classify the motility and dynamics of various predatory bacteria and phagocytes. In particular, there is a distinct region in the parameter space where they prove to be infallible predators.",Human
"We study self-propulsion of a half-metal coated colloidal particle under laser irradiation. The motion is caused by self-thermophoresis: i.e. absorption of laser at the metal-coated side of the particle creates local temperature gradient which in turn drives the particle by thermophoresis. To clarify the mechanism, temperature distribution and a thermal slip flow field around a micro-scale Janus particle are measured for the first time. With measured temperature drop across the particle, the speed of self-propulsion is corroborated with the prediction based on accessible parameters. As an application for driving micro-machine, a micro-rotor heat engine is demonstrated.",Human
"From genetic regulatory networks to nervous systems, the interactions between elements in biological networks often take a sigmoidal or S-shaped form. This paper develops a probabilistic characterization of the parameter space of continuous-time sigmoidal networks (CTSNs), a simple but dynamically-universal model of such interactions. We describe an efficient and accurate method for calculating the probability of observing effectively M-dimensional dynamics in an N-element CTSN, as well as a closed-form but approximate method. We then study the dependence of this probability on N, M, and the parameter ranges over which sampling occurs. This analysis provides insight into the overall structure of CTSN parameter space.",Human
"NF-{\kappa}B, one of key regulators of inflammation, apoptosis, and differentiation, was found to have noisy oscillatory shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in single cells when cells are stimulated by cytokine TNF{\alpha}. We present the analytical analysis which uncovers the underlying physical mechanisms of this spectacular noise-induced transition in biological networks. Starting with the master equation describing both signaling and transcription events in NF-{\kappa}B signaling network, we derived the macroscopic and the Fokker-Planck equations by using van Kampen's sysem size expansion. Using the noise-induced oscillatory signatures present in the power spectrum, we constructed the two-dimensional phase diagram where the noise-induced oscillation emerges in the dynamically stable parameter space.",Human
"A large repertoire of spatiotemporal activity patterns in the brain is the basis for adaptive behaviour. Understanding the mechanism by which the brain's hundred billion neurons and hundred trillion synapses manage to produce such a range of cortical configurations in a flexible manner remains a fundamental problem in neuroscience. One plausible solution is the involvement of universal mechanisms of emergent complex phenomena evident in dynamical systems poised near a critical point of a second-order phase transition. We review recent theoretical and empirical results supporting the notion that the brain is naturally poised near criticality, as well as its implications for better understanding of the brain.",Human
"The activity of collections of synchronizing neurons can be represented by weakly coupled nonlinear phase oscillators satisfying Kuramoto's equations. In this article, we build such neural-oscillator models, partly based on neurophysiological evidence, to represent approximately the learning behavior predicted and confirmed in three experiments by well-known stochastic learning models of behavioral stimulus-response theory. We use three Kuramoto oscillators to model a continuum of responses, and we provide detailed numerical simulations and analysis of the three-oscillator Kuramoto problem, including an analysis of the stability points for different coupling conditions. We show that the oscillator simulation data are well-matched to the behavioral data of the three experiments.",Human
"Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we deconvolved the sliding and hopping kinetics of GFP-LacI proteins on elongated DNA from their experimentally observed seconds-long diffusion trajectories. Our simulations suggest the following results: (1) in each diffusion trajectory, a protein makes on average hundreds of alternating slides and hops with a mean sliding time of several tens of ms; (2) sliding dominates the root mean square displacement of fast diffusion trajectories, whereas hopping dominates slow ones; (3) flow and variations in salt concentration have limited effects on hopping kinetics, while in vivo DNA configuration is not expected to influence sliding kinetics; furthermore, (4) the rate of occurrence for hops longer than 200 nm agrees with experimental data for EcoRV proteins.",Human
Existing theoretical models of evolution focus on the relative fitness advantages of different mutants in a population while the dynamic behavior of the population size is mostly left unconsidered. We here present a generic stochastic model which combines the growth dynamics of the population and its internal evolution. Our model thereby accounts for the fact that both evolutionary and growth dynamics are based on individual reproduction events and hence are highly coupled and stochastic in nature. We exemplify our approach by studying the dilemma of cooperation in growing populations and show that genuinely stochastic events can ease the dilemma by leading to a transient but robust increase in cooperation,Human
"We show that autocatalytic networks of epsilon-machines and their population dynamics differ substantially between spatial (geographically distributed) and nonspatial (panmixia) populations. Generally, regions of spacetime-invariant autocatalytic networks---or domains---emerge in geographically distributed populations. These are separated by functional membranes of complementary epsilon-machines that actively translate between the domains and are responsible for their growth and stability. We analyze both spatial and nonspatial populations, determining the algebraic properties of the autocatalytic networks that allow for space to affect the dynamics and so generate autocatalytic domains and membranes. In addition, we analyze populations of intermediate spatial architecture, delineating the thresholds at which spatial memory (information storage) begins to determine the character of the emergent auto-catalytic organization.",Human
"Phenological timing -- i.e. the course of annually recurring development stages in nature -- is of particular interest since it can be understood as a proxy for the climate at a specific region; moreover changes in the so called phenological phases can be a direct consequence of climate change. We analyze records of botanical phenology and study their fluctuations which we find to depend on the seasons. In contrast to previous studies, where typically trends in the phenology of individual species are estimated, we consider the ensemble of all available phases and propose a phenological index that characterizes the influence of climate on the multitude of botanical species.",Human
"Objections to Darwinian evolution are often based on the time required to carry out the necessary mutations. Seemingly, exponential numbers of mutations are needed. We show that such estimates ignore the effects of natural selection, and that the numbers of necessary mutations are thereby reduced to about $K\log{L}$, rather than $K^L$, where $L$ is the length of the genomic ""word"", and $K$ is the number of possible ""letters"" that can occupy any position in the word. The required theory makes contact with the theory of radix-exchange sorting in theoretical computer science, and the asymptotic analysis of certain sums that occur there.",Human
"We map the ultrasonic (8 MHz) speed and attenuation of edible-grade gelatin in water, exploring the key dependencies on temperature, concentration and time. The ultrasonic signatures of the sol-gel transition, confirmed by rheological measurements, and incomplete gel formation at low concentrations, enable a phase diagram of the system to be constructed. Sensitivity is also demonstrated to the kinetics of gel formation and melting, and associated hysteresis effects upon cyclic temperature sweeps. Furthermore, simple acoustic models of the sol and gel state enable estimation of the speed of sound and compressibility of gelatin. Our results demonstrate the potential of ultrasonic measurements to characterise the structure and visco-elasticity of gelatin hydrogels.",Human
"Summary: Macromolecular assembly vertebrates essential cellular processes, such as gene regulation and signal transduction. A major challenge for conventional computational methods to study these processes is tackling the exponential increase of the number of configurational states with the number of components. CplexA is a Mathematica package that uses functional programming to efficiently compute probabilities and average properties over such exponentially large number of states from the energetics of the interactions. The package is particularly suited to study gene expression at complex promoters controlled by multiple, local and distal, DNA binding sites for transcription factors. Availability: CplexA is freely available together with documentation at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cplexa/.",Human
"A recurrent loop consisting of a single neuron is considered which is influenced by a chemical excitatory delayed synaptic feedback. We show the response of the system is dependent to the duration of the activity of the synapse which is determined by the deactivation time constant of the synapse. We show that loops with slow synapses, those which the effect of the synaptic activation remains for time constants comparable to the period of firing, show more predictable results where the effect of the fast synapses is tightly dependent on the loop delay time. The results are compared to those of the loops with inhibitory synapses and also with electrical synapses.",Human
"We systematize and extend the description of vesicle growth and shape change using linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics. By restricting the study to shape changes from spheres to axisymmetric ellipsoids, we are able to give a consistent formulation which includes the lateral tension of the vesicle membrane. This allows us to generalize and correct a previous calculation. Our present calculations suggest that, for small growing vesicles, a prolate ellipsoidal shape should be favored over oblate ellipsoids, whereas for large growing vesicles oblates should be favored over prolates. The validity of this prediction is examined in the light of the various assumptions made in its derivation.",Human
"We describe a simple conductance-based model neuron that includes intra- and extra-cellular ion concentration dynamics and show that this model exhibits periodic bursting. The bursting arises as the fast spiking behavior of the neuron is modulated by the slow oscillatory behavior in the ion concentration variables, and vice versa. By separating these time scales and studying the bifurcation structure of the neuron, we catalog several qualitatively different bursting profiles that are strikingly similar to those seen in experimental preparations. Our work suggests that ion concentration dynamics may play an important role in modulating neuronal excitability in real biological systems.",Human
"In this paper we argue that, in addition to electrical and chemical signals propagating in the neurons of the brain, signal propagation takes place in the form of biophoton production. This statement is supported by recent experimental confirmation of photon guiding properties of a single neuron. We have investigated the interaction of mitochondrial biophotons with microtubules from a quantum mechanical point of view. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the interaction of biophotons and microtubules causes transitions/fluctuations of microtubules between coherent and incoherent states. A significant relationship between the fluctuation function of microtubules and alpha-EEG diagrams is elaborated on in this paper. We argue that the role of biophotons in the brain merits special attention.",Human
"The dominant reaction pathway (DRP) is a rigorous framework to microscopically compute the most probable trajectories, in non-equilibrium transitions. In the low-temperature regime, such dominant pathways encode the information about the reaction mechanism and can be used to estimate non-equilibrium averages of arbitrary observables. On the other hand, at sufficiently high temperatures, the stochastic fluctuations around the dominant paths become important and have to be taken into account. In this work, we develop a technique to systematically include the effects of such stochastic fluctuations, to order k_B T. This method is used to compute the probability for a transition to take place through a specific reaction channel and to evaluate the reaction rate.",Human
"Actomyosin contractility is essential for biological force generation, and is well understood in highly organized structures such as striated muscle. Additionally, actomyosin bundles devoid of this organization are known to contract both in vivo and in vitro, which cannot be described by standard muscle models. To narrow down the search for possible contraction mechanisms in these systems, we investigate their microscopic symmetries. We show that contractile behavior requires non-identical motors that generate large enough forces to probe the nonlinear elastic behavior of F-actin. This suggests a role for filament buckling in the contraction of these bundles, consistent with recent experimental results on reconstituted actomyosin bundles.",Human
"We consider a simple deterministic model which describes an asymmetric competition between an immune system with a specific and powerful response, and a virus with a broad toxicity and fast mutations. Interest in this model relies on the fact that in spite of it simplicity, it reproduces some of the features of the asymptomatic phase of the infection by HIV-1. In particular, there is a domain of parameters in which the dynamics is characterized by the apparition of \blips"", associated here to an instability which develops at high virus reproduction rate. Various possible extensions of this simple model are discussed, in particular in view of its applications in the context of HAART therapy.",Human
"Modular organization characterizes many complex networks occurring in nature, including the brain. In this paper we show that modular structure may be responsible for increasing the robustness of certain dynamical states of such systems. In a neural network model with threshold-activated binary elements, we observe that the basins of attractors, corresponding to patterns that have been embedded using a learning rule, occupy maximum volume in phase space at an optimal modularity. Simultaneously, the convergence time to these attractors decreases as a result of cooperative dynamics between the modules. The role of modularity in increasing global stability of certain desirable attractors of a system may provide a clue to its evolution and ubiquity in natural systems.",Human
"The draft sequence of the human genome became available almost a decade ago but the encoded proteome is not being explored to its fullest. Our bibliometric analysis of several large protein families, including those known to be ""druggable"", reveals that, even today, most papers focus on proteins that were known prior to 2000. It is evident that one or more aspects of the biomedical research system severely limits the exploration of the proteins in the 'dark matter' of the proteome, despite unbiased genetic approaches that have pointed to their functional relevance. It is perhaps not surprising that relatively few genome-derived targets have led to approved drugs.",Human
"We present experimental results regarding the electrotransfer of plasmid DNA into phosphatidylcholine giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Our observations indicate that a direct entry is the predominant mechanism of electrotransfer. A quantitative analysis of the DNA concentration increments inside the GUVs is also performed, and we find that our experimental data are very well described by a simple theoretical model in which DNA entry is mostly driven by electrophoresis. Our theoretical framework allows for the prediction of the amount of transfered DNA as a function of the electric field parameters, and thus paves the way towards a novel method for encapsulating with high efficiency not only DNA, but any negatively charged macromolecule into GUVs.",Human
"Understanding the physics of blood is challenging due to its nature as a suspension of soft particles and the fact that typical problems involve different scales. This is valid also for numerical investigations. In fact, many computational studies either neglect the existence of discrete cells or resolve relatively few cells very accurately. The authors recently developed a simple and highly efficient yet still particulate model with the aim to bridge the gap between currently applied methods. The present work focuses on its applicability to confined flows in vessels of diameters up to 100 micrometres. For hematocrit values below 30 percent, a dependence of the apparent viscosity on the vessel diameter in agreement with experimental literature data is found.",Human
Nonlinear interaction of membrane proteins with cytoskeleton and membrane leads to non-Gaussian structure of their displacement probability distribution. We propose a novel statistical analysis technique for learning the characteristics of the nonlinear potential from the cumulants of the displacement distribution. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on the analysis of kurtosis of the displacement distribution of the particle traveling on a membrane in a cage-type potential. Results of numerical simulations are supported by analytical predictions. We show that the approach allows robust identification of the potential for the much lower temporal resolution compare with the mean square displacement analysis.,Human
"Cells use genetic switches to shift between alternate gene expression states, e.g., to adapt to new environments or to follow a developmental pathway. Here, we study the dynamics of switching in a generic-feedback on/off switch. Unlike protein-only models, we explicitly account for stochastic fluctuations of mRNA, which have a dramatic impact on switch dynamics. Employing the WKB theory to treat the underlying chemical master equations, we obtain accurate results for the quasi-stationary distributions of mRNA and protein copy numbers and for the mean switching time, starting from either state. Our analytical results agree well with Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, one can use the approach to study the effect of varying biological parameters on switch stability.",Human
"We report on charge transport and current fluctuations in a single bacteriorhodpsin protein in a wide range of applied voltages covering direct and injection tunnelling regimes. The satisfactory agreement between theory and available experiments validates the physical plausibility of the model developed here. In particular, we predict a rather abrupt increase of the variance of current fluctuations in concomitance with that of the I-V characteristic. The sharp increase, for about five orders of magnitude of current variance is associated with the opening of low resistance paths responsible for the sharp increase of the I-V characteristics. A strong non-Gaussian behavior of the associated probability distribution function is further detected by numerical calculations.",Human
"The paper describes a method to understand time required to vaccinate against viruses in total as well as subpopulations. As a demonstration, a model based estimate for time required to vaccinate H1N1 in India, given its administrative difficulties is provided. We have proved novel theorems for the time functions defined in the paper. Such results are useful in planning for future epidemics. The number of days required to vaccinate entire high risk population in three subpopulations (villages, tehsils and towns) are noted to be 84, 89 and 88 respectively. There exists state wise disparities in the health infrastructure and capacities to deliver vaccines and hence national estimates need to be re-evaluated based on individual performances in the states.",Human
In this work we explore the effects of human mobility on the dispersion of a vector borne disease. We combine an already presented stochastic model for dengue with a simple representation of the daily motion of humans on a schematic city of 20x20 blocks with 100 inhabitants in each block. The pattern of motion of the individuals is described in terms of complex networks in which links connect different blocks and the link length distribution is in accordance with recent findings on human mobility. It is shown that human mobility can turn out to be the main driving force of the disease dispersal.,Human
Synchronous oscillatory dynamics is frequently observed in the human brain. We analyze the fine temporal structure of phase-locking in a realistic network model and match it with the experimental data from parkinsonian patients. We show that the experimentally observed intermittent synchrony can be generated just by moderately increased coupling strength in the basal ganglia circuits due to the lack of dopamine. Comparison of the experimental and modeling data suggest that brain activity in Parkinson's disease resides in the large boundary region between synchronized and nonsynchronized dynamics. Being on the edge of synchrony may allow for easy formation of transient neuronal assemblies.,Human
"We investigate the force generation by polymerizing bundles of filaments, which form because of short-range attractive filament interactions. We show that bundles can generate forces by a zipping mechanism, which is not limited by buckling and operates in the fully buckled state. The critical zipping force, i.e. the maximal force that a bundle can generate, is given by the adhesive energy gained during bundle formation. For opposing forces larger than the critical zipping force, bundles undergo a force-induced unbinding transition. For larger bundles, the critical zipping force depends on the initial configuration of the bundles. Our results are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations.",Human
"We apply theoretically open-loop quantum optimal control techniques to provide methods for the verification of various quantum coherent transport mechanisms in natural and artificial light-harvesting complexes under realistic experimental constraints. We demonstrate that optimally shaped laser pulses allow to faithfully prepare the photosystem in specified initial states (such as localized excitation or coherent superposition, i.e. propagating and non-propagating states) and to probe efficiently the dynamics. These results provide a path towards the discrimination of the different transport pathways and to the characterization of environmental properties, enhancing our understanding of the role that coherent processes may play in biological complexes.",Human
"Kinesin-5, also known as Eg5 in vertebrates is a processive motor with 4 heads, which moves on filamentous tracks called microtubules. The basic function of Kinesin-5 is to slide apart two anti-parallel microtubules by simultaneously walking on both the microtubules. We develop an analytical expression for the steady-state relative velocity of this sliding in terms of the rates of attachments and detachments of motor heads with the ATPase sites on the microtubules. We first analyse the motion of one pair of motor heads on one microtubule and then couple it to the motion of the other pair of motor heads of the same motor on the second microtubule to get the relative velocity of sliding.",Human
"We present a double site-bond percolation model to account, on the one hand, for the vascularization and/or resorption of biomaterial implant in bones and, on the other hand, for its mechanical continuity. The transformation of the implant into osseous material, and the dynamical formation/destruction of this osseous material is accounted for by creation and destruction of links and sites in two, entangled, networks. We identify the relevant parameters to describe the implant and its evolution, and separate their biological or chemical origin from their physical one. We classify the various phenomena in the two regimes, percolating or non-percolating, of the networks. We present first numerical results in two dimensions.",Human
"No existing algorithm can start with arbitrary RNA sequences and return the precise, three-dimensional structures that ensures their biological function. This chapter outlines current algorithms for automated RNA structure prediction (including our own FARNA-FARFAR), highlights their successes, and dissects their limitations, using a tetraloop and the sarcin/ricin motif as examples. The barriers to future advances are considered in light of three particular challenges: improving computational sampling, reducing reliance on experimentally solved structures, and avoiding coarse-grained representations of atomic-level interactions. To help meet these challenges and better understand the current state of the field, we propose an ongoing community-wide CASP-style experiment for evaluating the performance of current structure prediction algorithms.",Human
"A method for the direct patterning of electrostatic potential at the surface of hydroxyapatite is presented here. Micro-domains of surface potential have been created on hydroxyapatite coatings by a 20 keV focused electron beam with minimal alterations of surface chemistry. The success of such approach has been confirmed by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy measurements, which show that this method is capable of creating micron sized positive and negative local electrostatic potential. The shape and potential difference of these domains were found to depend on the dose of total injected charge from the electron beam as well as the speed with which such charge is injected.",Human
"Moment-closure methods are popular tools to simplify the mathematical analysis of stochastic models defined on networks, in which high dimensional joint distributions are approximated (often by some heuristic argument) as functions of lower dimensional distributions. Whilst undoubtedly useful, several such methods suffer from issues of non-uniqueness and inconsistency. These problems are solved by an approach based on the maximisation of entropy, which is motivated, derived and implemented in this article. A series of numerical experiments are also presented, detailing the application of the method to the Susceptible-Infective-Recovered model of epidemics, as well as cautionary examples showing the sensitivity of moment-closure techniques in general.",Human
We investigate the behavior of a treadmilling microswimmer in a two-dimensional unbounded domain with a semi-infinite no-slip wall. The wall can also be regarded as a probe or pipette inserted into the flow. We solve the governing evolution equations in an analytical form and numerically calculate trajectories of the swimmer for several different initial positions and orientations. We then compute the probability that the treadmilling organism can escape the vicinity of the wall. We find that many trajectories in a 'wedge' around the wall are likely to escape. This suggests that inserting a probe or pipette in a suspension of organism may push away treadmilling swimmers.,Human
"We study intact and bulging Escherichia coli cells using atomic force microscopy to separate the contributions of the cell wall and turgor pressure to the overall cell stiffness. We find strong evidence of power-law stress-stiffening in the E. coli cell wall, with an exponent of 1.22 \pm 0.12, such that the wall is significantly stiffer in intact cells (E = 23 \pm 8 MPa and 49 \pm 20 MPa in the axial and circumferential directions) than in unpressurized sacculi. These measurements also indicate that the turgor pressure in living cells E. coli is 29 \pm 3 kPa.",Human
"We inspect the geometry of proteins by identifying their backbones as framed polygons. We find that the left-handed helix region of the Ramachandran map for non-glycyl residues corresponds to an isolated and highly localized sector in the orientation of the $C_\beta$ carbons, when viewed in a Frenet frame that is centered at the corresponding $C_\alpha$ carbons. We show that this localization in the orientation persists to $C_\gamma$ and $C_\delta$ carbons. Furthermore, when we extend our analysis to the neighboring residues we conclude that the left-handed helix region reflects a very regular and apparently residue independent collective interplay of at least seven consecutive amino acids.",Human
"Near a critical point, the time scale of thermally-induced fluctuations diverges in a manner determined by the dynamic universality class. Experiments have verified predicted 3D dynamic critical exponents in many systems, but similar experiments in 2D have been lacking for the case of conserved order parameter. Here we analyze time-dependent correlation functions of a quasi-2D lipid bilayer in water to show that its critical dynamics agree with a recently predicted universality class. In particular, the effective dynamic exponent $z_{\text{eff}}$ crosses over from $\sim 2$ to $\sim 3$ as the correlation length of fluctuations exceeds a hydrodynamic length set by the membrane and bulk viscosities.",Human
"Evolutionary biology shares many concepts with statistical physics: both deal with populations, whether of molecules or organisms, and both seek to simplify evolution in very many dimensions. Often, methodologies have undergone parallel and independent development, as with stochastic methods in population genetics. We discuss aspects of population genetics that have embraced methods from physics: amongst others, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, travelling waves, and Monte-Carlo methods have been used to study polygenic evolution, rates of adaptation, and range expansions. These applications indicate that evolutionary biology can further benefit from interactions with other areas of statistical physics, for example, by following the distribution of paths taken by a population through time.",Human
"Amplification underlies the operation of many biological and engineering systems. Simple electrical, optical, and mechanical amplifiers are reciprocal: the backward coupling of the output to the input equals the forward coupling of the input to the output. Unidirectional amplifiers that occur often in electrical and optical systems are special non-reciprocal devices in which the output does not couple back to the input even though the forward coupling persists. Here we propose a scheme for unidirectional mechanical amplification that we utilize to construct an active microphone. We show that amplification improves the microphone's threshold for detecting weak signals and that unidirectionality prevents distortion.",Human
"The quasispecies model of biological evolution for asexual organisms such as bacteria and viruses has attracted considerable attention of biological physicists. Many variants of the model have been proposed and subsequently solved using the methods of statistical physics. In this paper I will put forward important but largely overlooked relations between localization theory, random matrices, and the quasispecies model. These relations will help me to study the dynamics of this model. In particular, I will show that the distribution of times between evolutionary jumps in the genotype space follows a power law, in agreement with recent findings in the shell model - a simplified version of the quasispecies model.",Human
"We derive a convex optimization problem on a steady-state nonequilibrium network of biochemical reactions, with the property that energy conservation and the second law of thermodynamics both hold at the problem solution. This suggests a new variational principle for biochemical networks that can be implemented in a computationally tractable manner. We derive the Lagrange dual of the optimization problem and use strong duality to demonstrate that a biochemical analogue of Tellegen's theorem holds at optimality. Each optimal flux is dependent on a free parameter that we relate to an elementary kinetic parameter when mass action kinetics is assumed.",Human
We present Molecular Dynamics simulations of a single stranded unprotonated DNA i-motif in explicit solvent. Our results indicate that the native structure in non-acidic solution at 300 K is unstable and completely vanishes on a time scale up to 10 ns. Two unfolding mechanisms with decreasing connectivity between the initially interacting nucleobases can be identified where one pathway is characterized as entropically more favorable. The entropic preference can be mainly explained by strong water ordering effects due to hydrogen bonds for several occurring structures along the pathways. Finally we are able to indicate via free energy calculations the most stable configurations belonging to distinct hairpin structures in good agreement to experimental results.,Human
"Nested structure, which is non-random, controls cooperation dynamics and biodiversity in plant-animal mutualistic networks. This structural pattern has been explained in a static (non-growth) network models. However, evolutionary processes might also influence the formation of such a structural pattern. We thereby propose an evolving network model for plant-animal interactions and show that non-random patterns such as nested structure and heterogeneous connectivity are both qualitatively and quantitatively predicted through simple evolutionary processes. This finding implies that network models can be simplified by considering evolutionary processes, and also that another explanation exists for the emergence of non-random patterns and might provide more comprehensible insights into the formation of plant-animal mutualistic networks from the evolutionary perspective.",Human
"Bending of DNA from a straight rod to a circular form in presence of any of the mono-, di-, tri- or tetravalent counterions has been simulated in strong Coulomb coupling environment employing a previously developed energy minimization simulation technique. The inherent characteristics of the simulation technique allow monitoring the required electrostatic contribution to the bending. The curvature of the bending has been found to play crucial roles in facilitating electrostatic attractive potential energy. The total electrostatic potential energy has been found to decrease with bending which indicates that bending a straight DNA to a circular form or to a toroidal form in presence of neutralizing counterions is energetically favorable and practically is a spontaneous phenomenon.",Human
"Fabrication of DNA nanostructures primarily follows two fundamental rules. First, DNA oligonucleotides mutually combine by Watson-Crick base pairing rules between complementary base sequences. Second, the geometrical compatibility of the DNA oligonucleotide must match for lattices to form. Here we present a fabrication scheme of DNA nanostructures with non-complementary and/or geometrically incompatible DNA oligonucleotides, which contradicts conventional DNA structure creation rules. Quantitative analyses of DNA lattice sizes were carried out to verify the unfavorable binding occurrences which correspond to errors in algorithmic self-assembly. Further studies of these types of bindings may shed more light on the exact mechanisms at work in the self-assembly of DNA nanostructures.",Human
"The interplay of geometrical and topological entanglement in semiflexible knotted polymer rings confined inside a spherical cavity is investigated using advanced numerical methods. By using stringent and robust algorithms for locating knots, we characterize how the knot length lk depends on the ring contour length, Lc and the radius of the confining sphere, Rc . In the no- and strong- confinement cases we observe weak knot localization and complete knot delocalization, respectively. We show that the complex interplay of lk, Lc and Rc that seamlessly bridges these two limits can be encompassed by a simple scaling argument based on deflection theory. The same argument is used to rationalize the multiscale character of the entanglement that emerges with increasing confinement.",Human
"We study the storage of multiple phase-coded patterns as stable dynamical attractors in recurrent neural networks with sparse connectivity. To determine the synaptic strength of existent connections and store the phase-coded patterns, we introduce a learning rule inspired to the spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We find that, after learning, the spontaneous dynamics of the network replay one of the stored dynamical patterns, depending on the network initialization. We study the network capacity as a function of topology, and find that a small- world-like topology may be optimal, as a compromise between the high wiring cost of long range connections and the capacity increase.",Human
"We investigated the ability of diamond nanoparticles (nanodiamonds, NDs) to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) in Ewing sarcoma cells, in the perspective of in vivo anti-cancer nucleic acid drug delivery. siRNA was adsorbed onto NDs previously coated with cationic polymer. Cell uptake of NDs has been demonstrated by taking advantage of NDs intrinsic fluorescence coming from embedded color center defects. Cell toxicity of these coated NDs was shown to be low. Consistent with the internalization efficacy, we have shown a specific inhibition of EWS/Fli-1 gene expression at the mRNA and protein level by the ND vectorized siRNA in a serum containing medium.",Human
"Abstracting an effective theory from a complicated process is central to the study of complexity. Even when the underlying mechanisms are understood, or at least measurable, the presence of dissipation and irreversibility in biological, computational and social systems makes the problem harder. Here we demonstrate the construction of effective theories in the presence of both irreversibility and noise, in a dynamical model with underlying feedback. We use the Krohn-Rhodes theorem to show how the composition of underlying mechanisms can lead to innovations in the emergent effective theory. We show how dissipation and irreversibility fundamentally limit the lifetimes of these emergent structures, even though, on short timescales, the group properties may be enriched compared to their noiseless counterparts.",Human
"We consider the edge-based compartmental models for epidemic spread developed in Part I. We show conditions under which simpler models may be substituted for more detailed models, and in so doing we define a hierarchy of epidemic models. In particular we provide conditions under which it is appropriate to use the standard mass action SIR model, and we show what happens when these conditions fail. Using our hierarchy, we provide a procedure leading to the choice of the appropriate model for a given population. Our result about the convergence of models to the Mass Action model gives clear, rigorous conditions under which the Mass Action model is accurate.",Human
"Interactions among neighboring birds in a flock cause an alignment of their flight directions. We show that the minimally structured (maximum entropy) model consistent with these local correlations correctly predicts the propagation of order throughout entire flocks of starlings, with no free parameters. These models are mathematically equivalent to the Heisenberg model of magnetism, and define an ""energy"" for each configuration of flight directions in the flock. Comparing flocks of different densities, the range of interactions that contribute to the energy involves a fixed number of (topological) neighbors, rather than a fixed (metric) spatial range. Comparing flocks of different sizes, the model correctly accounts for the observed scale invariance of long ranged correlations among the fluctuations in flight direction.",Human
"Ankylography is a new 3D imaging technique, which, under certain circumstances, enables reconstruction of a 3D object from a single sample orientation. Here, we provide a matrix rank analysis to explain the principle of ankylography. We then present an ankylography experiment on a microscale phase object using an optical laser. Coherent diffraction patterns are acquired from the phase object using a planar CCD detector and are projected onto a spherical shell. The 3D structure of the object is directly reconstructed from the spherical diffraction pattern. This work may potentially open the door to a new method for 3D imaging of phase objects in the visible light region. Finally, the extension of ankylography to more complicated and larger objects is suggested.",Human
"A major issue in biology is the understanding of the interactions between proteins. These interactions can be described by a network, where the proteins are modeled by nodes and the interactions by edges. The origin of these protein networks is not well understood yet. Here we present a two-step model, which generates clusters with the same topological properties as networks for protein-protein interactions, namely, the same degree distribution, cluster size distribution, clustering coefficient and shortest path length. The biological and model networks are not scale free but exhibit small world features. The model allows the fitting of different biological systems by tuning a single parameter.",Human
"A new numerical characterization of symbolic sequences is proposed. The partition of sequence based on Ke and Tong algorithm is a starting point. Algorithm decomposes original sequence into set of distinct subsequences - a patterns. The set of subsequences common for two symbolic sequences (their intersection) is proposed as a measure of similarity between them. The new similarity measure works well for short (of tens letters) sequences and the very long (of hundred thousand letters) as well. When applied to nucleotide or protein sequences may help to trace possible evolutionary of species. As an illustration, similarity of several sets of nucleotide and amino acid sequences is examined.",Human
"It is well known that during homology recognition and strand exchange the double stranded DNA (dsDNA) in DNA/RecA filaments is highly extended, but the functional role of the extension has been unclear. We present an analytical model that calculates the distribution of tension in the extended dsDNA during strand exchange. The model suggests that the binding of additional dsDNA base pairs to the DNA/RecA filament alters the tension in dsDNA that was already bound to the filament, resulting in a non-linear increase in the mechanical energy as a function of the number of bound base pairs. This collective mechanical response may promote homology stringency and underlie unexplained experimental results.",Human
"In a recent paper on 'Estimating Species Trees from Unrooted Gene Trees' Liu and Yu observe that the distance matrix on the underlying taxon set, which is built up from expected internode distances on gene trees under the multispecies coalescent, is tree-like, and that the underlying additive tree has the same topology as the true species tree. Hence they suggest to use (observed) average internode distances on gene trees as an input for the neighbor joining algorithm to estimate the underlying species tree in a statistically consistent way. In this note we give a rigorous proof of their above mentioned observation.",Human
"In this paper we suggest that, under suitable conditions, supervised learning can provide the basis to formulate at the microscopic level quantitative questions on the phenotype structure of multicellular organisms. The problem of explaining the robustness of the phenotype structure is rephrased as a real geometrical problem on a fixed domain. We further suggest a generalization of path integrals that reduces the problem of deciding whether a given molecular network can generate specific phenotypes to a numerical property of a robustness function with complex output, for which we give heuristic justification. Finally, we use our formalism to interpret a pointedly quantitative developmental biology problem on the allowed number of pairs of legs in centipedes.",Human
"We summarize some aspects of electrostatic interactions in the context of viruses. A simplified but, within well defined limitations, reliable approach is used to derive expressions for electrostatic energies and the corresponding osmotic pressures in single-stranded RNA viruses and double-stranded DNA bacteriophages. The two types of viruses differ crucially in the spatial distribution of their genome charge which leads to essential differences in their free energies, depending on the capsid size and total charge in a quite different fashion. Differences in the free energies are trailed by the corresponding characteristics and variations in the osmotic pressure between the inside of the virus and the external bathing solution.",Human
"We develop and study the evolution of a model of radiation induced apoptosis in cells using stochastic simulations, and identified key protein targets for effective mitigation of radiation damage. We identified several key proteins associated with cellular apoptosis using an extensive literature survey. In particular, we focus on the p53 transcription dependent and p53 transcription independent pathways for mitochondrial apoptosis. Our model reproduces known p53 oscillations following radiation damage. The key, experimentally testable hypotheses that we generate are - inhibition of PUMA is an effective strategy for mitigation of radiation damage if the treatment is administered immediately, at later stages following radiation damage, inhibition of tBid is more effective.",Human
"Gene delivery of nucleic acid to the cell nucleus is a fundamental step in gene therapy. In this review of modeling drug and gene delivery, we focus on the particular stage of plasmid DNA or virus cytoplasmic trafficking. A challenging problem is to quantify the success of this limiting stage. We present some models and simulations of plasmid trafficking and of the limiting phase of DNA-polycation escape from an endosome and discuss virus cytoplasmic trafficking. The models can be used to assess the success of viral escape from endosomes, to quantify the early step of viral-cell infection, and to propose new simulation tools for designing new hybrid-viruses as synthetic vectors.",Human
"We introduce a model of biological evolution where species evolve in response to biotic interactions and a fluctuating environmental stress. The species may either become extinct or mutate to acquire a new fitness value when the effective stress level is greater than their individual fitness. The model exhibits a phase transition to a completely extinct phase as the environmental stress or the mutation rate is varied. We discuss the generic conditions for which this transition is continuous. The model is exactly solvable and the critical behavior is characterized by an unusual dynamic exponent z=1/3. Apart from predicting large scale evolution, the model can be applied to understand the trends in the available fossil data.",Human
"We analytically study the input-output properties of a neuron whose active dendritic tree, modeled as a Cayley tree of excitable elements, is subjected to Poisson stimulus. Both single-site and two-site mean-field approximations incorrectly predict a non-equilibrium phase transition which is not allowed in the model. We propose an excitable-wave mean-field approximation which shows good agreement with previously published simulation results [Gollo et al., PLoS Comput. Biol. 5(6) e1000402 (2009)] and accounts for finite-size effects. We also discuss the relevance of our results to experiments in neuroscience, emphasizing the role of active dendrites in the enhancement of dynamic range and in gain control modulation.",Human
"Water near hydrophobic surfaces is like that at a liquid-vapor interface, where fluctuations in water density are substantially enhanced compared to that in bulk water. Here we use molecular simulations with specialized sampling techniques to show that water density fluctuations are similarly enhanced, even near hydrophobic surfaces of complex biomolecules, situating them at the edge of a dewetting transition. Consequently, water near these surfaces is sensitive to subtle changes in surface conformation, topology, and chemistry, any of which can tip the balance towards or away from the wet state, and thus significantly alter biomolecular interactions and function. Our work also resolves the long-standing puzzle of why some biological surfaces dewet and other seemingly similar surfaces do not.",Human
"The emergence of biochemical activities in a protein seem to commence with the onset of atomic mean-square displacements along the protein lattice. The ensuing protein dynamical transition has been discussed extensively in the literature, and often with conflicting conclusions. Here we clarify the phenomenon by establishing a deep connection between the dynamical transition and the pseudogap state where high-temperature superconductivity comes to its end.   For this we first show how to endow proteins with an order parameter akin the quasiparticle wave function in superconductors. We then present universality arguments to claim that the protein dynamical transition takes place in tandem with a pseudogap transmutation. We confirm that available experimental data fully supports our proposal.",Human
"The distances over which biological molecules and their complexes can function range from a few nanometres, in the case of folded structures, to millimetres, for example during chromosome organization. Describing phenomena that cover such diverse length, and also time scales, requires models that capture the underlying physics for the particular length scale of interest. Theoretical ideas, in particular, concepts from polymer physics, have guided the development of coarse-grained models to study folding of DNA, RNA, and proteins. More recently, such models and their variants have been applied to the functions of biological nanomachines. Simulations using coarse-grained models are now poised to address a wide range of problems in biology.",Human
A model to describe the mechanism of conformational dynamics in protein based on matter interactions using lagrangian approach and imposing certain symmetry breaking is proposed. Both conformation changes of proteins and the injected non-linear sources are represented by the bosonic lagrangian with an additional \phi^4 interaction for the sources. In the model the spring tension of protein representing the internal hydrogen bonds is realized as the interactions between individual amino acids and nonlinear sources. The folding pathway is determined by the strength of nonlinear sources that propagate through the protein backbone. It is also shown that the model reproduces the results in some previous works.,Human
"Correlations among spikes, both on the same neuron and across neurons, are ubiquitous in the brain. For example cross-correlograms can have large peaks, at least in the periphery, and smaller -- but still non-negligible -- ones in cortex, and auto-correlograms almost always exhibit non-trivial temporal structure at a range of timescales. Although this has been known for over forty years, it's still not clear what role these correlations play in the brain -- and, indeed, whether they play any role at all. The goal of this chapter is to shed light on this issue by reviewing some of the work on this subject.",Human
"Dynamics of single flexible non-Brownian fibers, tumbling in a Poiseuille flow between two parallel solid plane walls, is studied with the use of the hydromultipole numerical code, based on the multipole expansion of the Stokes equations, corrected for lubrication. It is shown that for a wide range of the system parameters, the migration rate towards the middle plane of the channel increases for fibers, which are closer to a wall, or are more flexible (less stiff), or are longer. The faster motion towards the channel center is accompanied by a slower translation along the flow and a larger fiber deformation.",Human
"We consider a chemical reaction network governed by mass action kinetics and composed of N different species which can reversibly form heterodimers. A fast iterative algorithm is introduced to compute the equilibrium concentrations of such networks. We show that the convergence is guaranteed by the Banach fixed point theorem. As a practical example, of relevance for a quantitative analysis of microarray data, we consider a reaction network formed by N~10^6 mutually hybridizing different mRNA sequences. We show that, despite the large number of species involved, the convergence to equilibrium is very rapid for most species. The origin of slow convergence for some specific subnetworks is discussed. This provides some insights for improving the performance of the algorithm.",Human
"""Cicada: a Heavy but Agile Flyer"" is a fluid dynamic video submitted to Gallery of Fluid Motion in APS-DFD 2011. Comparing to other insects, cicadas can generate much higher lift to overcome their large body weight. The hidden mechanism may help in designing a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) to carry large payloads. However, it is lack of literatures in discussing how cicadas use their wings to accomplish various flights. In this work, a high-speed photogrammetry system and 3D surface reconstruction technology are used to reveal cicada wing kinematics and deformation during a freely forward flight. The aerodynamic performance is studied using in-house immerse boundary method based Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) solver.",Human
"Blebs are balloon-shaped membrane protrusions that form during many physiological processes. Using computer simulation of a particle-based model for self-assembled lipid bilayers coupled to an elastic meshwork, we investigated the phase behavior and kinetics of blebbing. We found that blebs form for large values of the ratio between the areas of the bilayer and the cytoskeleton. We also found that blebbing can be induced when the cytoskeleton is subject to a localized ablation or a uniform compression. The results obtained are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental evidence and the model opens up the possibility to study the kinetics of bleb formation in detail.",Human
"Is there an overriding principle of nature, hitherto overlooked, that governs all population behavior? A single principle that drives all the regimes observed in nature - exponential-like growth, saturated growth, population decline, population extinction, oscillatory behavior? In current orthodox population theory, this diverse range of population behaviors is described by many different equations - each with its own specific justification. The signature of an overriding principle would be a differential equation which, in a single statement, embraces all the panoply of regimes. A candidate such governing equation is proposed. The principle from which the equation is derived is this: The effect on the environment of a population's success is to alter that environment in a way that opposes the success.",Human
"We consider a generalized two-species population dynamic model and analytically solve it for the amensalism and commensalism ecological interactions. These two-species models can be simplified to a one-species model with a time dependent extrinsic growth factor. With a one-species model with an effective carrying capacity one is able to retrieve the steady state solutions of the previous one-species model. The equivalence obtained between the effective carrying capacity and the extrinsic growth factor is complete only for a particular case, the Gompertz model. Here we unveil important aspects of sigmoid growth curves, which are relevant to growth processes and population dynamics.",Human
"This writing: a) Draws attention to the intricacies inherent to the pursuit of a universal seizure definition even when powerful, well understood signal analysis methods are utilized to this end; b) Identifies this aim as a multi-objective optimization problem and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of adopting or rejecting a unitary seizure definition; c) Introduces a Probabilistic Measure of Seizure Activity to manage this thorny issue. The challenges posed by the attempt to define seizures unitarily may be partly related to their fractal properties and understood through a simplistic analogy to the so-called ""Richardson effect"". A revision of the time-honored conceptualization of seizures may be warranted to further advance epileptology.",Human
"Neutral speciation mechanisms based on isolation by distance and sexual selection, termed topopatric, have recently been shown to describe the observed patterns of abundance distributions and species-area relationships. Previous works have considered this type of process only in the context of hermaphrodic populations. In this work we extend a hermaphroditic model of topopatric speciation to populations where individuals are explicitly separated into males and females. We show that for a particular carrying capacity speciation occurs under similar conditions, but the number of species generated decreases as compared to the hermaphroditic case. Evolution results in fewer species having more abundant populations.",Human
"The precise role of the microenvironment on tumor growth is poorly understood. Whereas the tumor is in constant competition with the surrounding tissue, little is known about the mechanics of this interaction. Using a novel experimental procedure, we study quantitatively the effect of an applied mechanical stress on the long-term growth of a spheroid cell aggregate. We observe that a stress of 10 kPa is sufficient to drastically reduce growth by inhibition of cell proliferation mainly in the core of the spheroid. We compare the results to a simple numerical model developed to describe the role of mechanics in cancer progression.",Human
"Neuronal mechanisms underlying addiction have been attracting attention in neurobiology, economics, neuropsychiatry, and neuroeconomics. This paper proposes a possible link between economic theory of addiction (Becker and Murphy, 1988) and neurobiological theory of bidirectional synaptic plasticity (Bienenstock, Cooper, Munro, 1982) based on recent findings in neuroeconomics and neurobiology of addiction. Furthermore, it is suggested that several neurobiological substrates such as cortisol (a stress hormone), NMDA and AMPA receptors/subunits and intracellular calcium in the postsynaptic neurons are critical factors determining parameters in Becker and Murphy's economic theory of addiction. Future directions in the application of the theory to studies in neuroeconomics and neuropsychiatry of addiction and its relation to stress at the molecular level are discussed.",Human
"Intertemporal choice has drawn attention in behavioral economics, econophysics, and neuroeconomics. Recent studies in mainstream economics have mainly focused on inconsistency in intertemporal choice (dynamic inconsistency); while impulsivity/impatience in intertemporal choice has been extensively studied in behavioral economics of addiction. However, recent advances in neuroeconomic and econophysical studies on intertemporal choice have made it possible to study both impulsivity and inconsistency in intertemporal choice within a unified framework. In this paper I propose the new frameworks for investigations into neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice. The importance of studying neurochemical and neuroendocrinological modulations of intertemporal choice and time-perception (e.g. serotonin, dopamine, cortisol, testosterone, and epinephrine) is emphasized.",Human
"DNA based nanostructures built on a long single stranded DNA scaffold, known as DNA origamis, offer the possibility to organize various molecules at the nanometer scale in one pot experiments.   The folding of the scaffold is guaranteed by the presence of short, single stranded DNA sequences (staples), that hold together separate regions of the scaffold. In this paper, we modelize the annealing-melting properties of these DNA constructions. The model captures important features such as the hysteresis between melting and annealing, as well as the dependence upon the topology of the scaffold. We show that cooperativity between staples is critical to quantitatively explain the folding process of DNA origamis.",Human
In this paper we explore the life expectancy at birth in the Netherlands by based on a recent theory and a new methodology but also a classical theory of fitting and forecasting. We use the data from 1850 to 2006 provided by the Human Mortality Database (HMD) for the annual deaths per year of age and the structure of the population per year of age. We apply the IM first exit time model which includes also the infant mortality by using the appropriate non-linear regression analysis program that we have developed in Excel. We provide all the related material from the website: http://www.cmsim.net,Human
We employ a large scale molecular simulation based on bond-order ReaxFF to simulate the chemical reaction and study the damage to a large fragment of DNA-molecule in the solution by ionizing radiation. We illustrate that the randomly distributed clusters of diatomic OH-radicals that are primary products of megavoltage ionizing radiation in water-based systems are the main source of hydrogen-abstraction as well as formation of carbonyl- and hydroxyl-groups in the sugar-moiety that create holes in the sugar-rings. These holes grow up slowly between DNA-bases and DNA-backbone and the damage collectively propagate to DNA single and double strand break.,Human
"Information is a key concept in evolutionary biology. Information is stored in biological organism's genomes, and used to generate the organism as well as to maintain and control it. Information is also ""that which evolves"". When a population adapts to a local environment, information about this environment is fixed in a representative genome. However, when an environment changes, information can be lost. At the same time, information is processed by animal brains to survive in complex environments, and the capacity for information processing also evolves. Here I review applications of information theory to the evolution of proteins as well as to the evolution of information processing in simulated agents that adapt to perform a complex task.",Human
"The statistical properties of protein folding within the {\phi}^4 model are investigated. The calculation is performed using statistical mechanics and path integral method. In particular, the evolution of heat capacity in term of temperature is given for various levels of the nonlinearity of source and the strength of interaction between protein backbone and nonlinear source. It is found that the nonlinear source contributes constructively to the specific heat especially at higher temperature when it is weakly interacting with the protein backbone. This indicates increasing energy absorption as the intensity of nonlinear sources are getting greater. The simulation of protein folding dynamics within the model is also refined.",Human
"The impact of damping effect and external forces to the DNA breathing is investigated within the Peyrard-Bishop model. In in the continuum limit, the dynamics of the breathing of DNA is described by the forced-damped nonlinear Schrodinger equation and studied by means of variational method. The analytical solutions are obtained for special cases. It is shown that the breather propagation is decelerated in the presence of damping factor without the external force, while the envelope velocity and the amplitude increase significantly with the presence of external force. It is particularly found that the higher harmonic terms are enhanced when the periodic force is applied. It is finally argued that the external force accelerates the DNA breathing.",Human
"Finite stochastic Markov models play a major role for modelling biochemical pathways. Such models are a coarse-grained description of the underlying microscopic dynamics and can be considered mesoscopic. The level of coarse-graining is to a certain extend arbitrary since it depends on the resolution of accomodating measurements. Here, we present a way to simplify such stochastic descriptions, which preserves both the meso-micro and the meso-macro connection. The former is achieved by demanding locality, the latter by considering cycles on the network of states. Using single- and multicycle examples we demonstrate how our new method preserves fluctuations of observables much better than na\""ive approaches.",Human
"Because organisms synthesize component molecules at rates that reflect those molecules' adaptive utility, we expect a population of biota to leave a distinctive chemical signature on their environment that is anomalous given the local (abiotic) chemistry. We observe the same effect in the distribution of computer instructions used by an evolving population of digital organisms, and characterize the robustness of the evolved signature with respect to a number of different changes in the system's physics. The observed instruction abundance anomaly has features that are consistent over a large number of evolutionary trials and alterations in system parameters, which makes it a candidate for a non-Earth-centric life-diagnostic",Human
"We report on a case of autocatalytic feedback in a template directed synthesis of a self-complementary hexa-PNA from two trimeric building blocks. The course of the reaction was monitored in the presence of increasing initial concentrations of product by means of RP-HPLC. Kinetic modeling with the SimFit program revealed parabolic growth according to the so-called square-root law. The observed template effect, as well as the rate of the ligation, was significantly influenced by factors like nucleophilic catalysts, pH value, and uncharged co-solvents. Systematic optimization of the reaction conditions allowed us to increase the autocatalytic efficiency of the system by two orders of magnitude.",Human
"This article shows how to fit reticulate finite and infinite sites sequence spectra to aligned data from five modern human genomes (San, Yoruba, French, Han and Papuan) plus two archaic humans (Denisovan and Neanderthal), to better infer demographic parameters. These include interbreeding between distinct lineages. Major improvements in the fit of the sequence spectrum are made with successively more complicated models. Findings include some evidence of a male biased gene flow from the Denisova lineage to Papuan ancestors and possibly even more archaic gene flow. It is unclear if there is evidence for more than one Neanderthal interbreeding, as the evidence suggesting this largely disappears when a finite sites model is fitted.",Human
"One of the more interesting themes of the mathematical ecology is the description of the mutualistic interaction between two interacting species. Based on continuous-time model developed by Holland and DeAngelis 2009 for consumer-resource mutualism description, this work deals with the application of the Mickens Non Standard Finite Difference method to transform the continuous-time scheme into a discrete-time one. It has been proved that the Mickens scheme is dynamically consistent with the original one regardless of the step-sizes used in numerical simulations, in opposition of the forward Euler method that shows numerical instabilities when the step size overcomes a critical value.",Human
"We show that the folding rates (k_F) of RNA are determined by N, the number of nucleotides. By assuming that the distribution of free energy barriers separating the folded and the unfolded states is Gaussian, which follows from central limit theorem arguments and polymer physics concepts, we show that k_F ~ k_0 exp(-alpha N^0.5). Remarkably, the theory fits the experimental rates spanning over seven orders of magnitude with k_0 ~ 1.0 (microsec)^{-1}. An immediate consequence of our finding is that the speed limit of RNA folding is about one microsecond just as it is in the folding of globular proteins.",Human
"We show how strain stiffening affects the elastic response to internal forces, caused either by material defects and inhomogeneities or by active forces that molecular motors generate in living cells. For a spherical force dipole in a material with a strongly nonlinear strain energy density, strains change sign with distance, indicating that even around a contractile inclusion or molecular motor there is radial compression; it is only at long distance that one recovers the linear response in which the medium is radially stretched. Scaling laws with irrational exponents relate the far-field renormalized strain to the near-field strain applied by the inclusion or active force.",Human
"Osmotic deflation of vesicles enclosing two liquid phases can lead to bulging of one of the phases from the vesicle body. This budding process is preceded by a complete to partial wetting transition of one of the liquid phases on the membrane and depends on the membrane tensions and the tension of the interface between the enclosed liquid phases. These tensions dominate in different morphology regimes, the crossover of which initiates the budding process. In addition, the degree of budding can be controlled by aspiration via micropipettes. We also demonstrate that the budding direction can be reversed if there are two external phases in contact with the vesicle.",Human
"Microarrays are made it possible to simultaneously monitor the expression profiles of thousands of genes under various experimental conditions. Identification of co-expressed genes and coherent patterns is the central goal in microarray or gene expression data analysis and is an important task in Bioinformatics research. In this paper, K-Means algorithm hybridised with Cluster Centre Initialization Algorithm (CCIA) is proposed Gene Expression Data. The proposed algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of specifying the number of clusters in the K-Means methods. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed method performs well on gene Expression Data when compare with the traditional K- Means clustering and Silhouette Coefficients cluster measure.",Human
"Neutral particles ejected from biological material under ultra short laser ablation have been investigated by laser post-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. It could be shown, that beside ionized species, a substantial amount of neutral particles is ejected. A temporal study of the ablation plume is carried out by recording neutral particle time-of- flight mass spectra as a function of delay time between the ablation and post-ionization pulse. Close the ablation threshold, the mechanism of ejection is found to be of predominantely mechanical nature, driven by the relaxation of the laser-induced pressure. In this regime of stress confinement, the ejection results in very broad velocity distributions and extremely low velocities.",Human
"Previously, there existed no clear explanation why chaotic dynamics is always accompanied by the infinitely long memory of perturbations (and/or initial conditions) known as the butterfly effect (BE). In this paper, it is shown that within the recently proposed approximation-free supersymmetric theory of stochastic (partial) differential equations (SDE), the BE is a derivable consequence of (stochastic) chaos, a rigorous definition of which is the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry that all SDEs possess. It is also discussed that the concept of ergodicy must be refined under the condition of the spontaneous breakdown of pseudo-time-reversal symmetry when the model has ""physical"" states of multiple eigenvalues that survive the physical limit of the infinitely long temporal propagation.",Human
"A mechanism of double strand breaking (DSB) in DNA due to the action of two electrons is considered. These are the electrons produced in the vicinity of DNA molecules due to ionization of water molecules with a consecutive emission of two electrons, making such a mechanism possible. This effect qualitatively solves a puzzle of large yields of DSBs following irradiation of DNA molecules. The transport of secondary electrons, including the additional electrons, is studied in relation to the assessment of radiation damage due to incident ions. This work is a stage in the inclusion of Auger mechanism and like effects into the multiscale approach to ion-beam cancer therapy.",Human
"We study the variation of the dielectric response of a dielectric liquid (e.g. water) when a salt is added to the solution. Employing field-theoretical methods we expand the Gibbs free-energy to first order in a loop expansion and calculate self-consistently the dielectric constant. We predict analytically the dielectric decrement which depends on the ionic strength in a complex way. Furthermore, a qualitative description of the hydration shell is found and is characterized by a single length scale. Our prediction fits rather well a large range of concentrations for different salts using only one fit parameter related to the size of ions and dipoles.",Human
"It is now well accepted that cellular responses to materials in a biological medium reflect greatly the adsorbed biomolecular layer, rather than the material itself. Here, we study by molecular dynamic simulations the competitive protein adsorption on a surface (Vroman effect), i.e. the non-monotonic behavior of the amount of protein adsorbed on a surface in contact with plasma as a function of contact time and plasma concentration. We find a complex behavior, with regimes during which small and large proteins are not necessarily competing between them, but are both competing with others in solution. We show how the effect can be understood, controlled and inverted.",Human
"We consider the translocation of a one-dimensional polymer through a pore channel helped by a motor driven by a dichotomous noise with time exponential correlation. We are interested in the study of the translocation time, mean velocity and stall force of the system as a function of the mean driving frequency. We find a monotonous translocation time, in contrast with the mean velocity which shows a pronounced maximum at a given frequency. Interestingly, the stall force shows a nonmonotonic behavior with the presence of a minimum. The influence of the spring elastic constant to the mean translocation times and velocities is also presented.",Human
"We study the synchronisation and phase-lag of fluctuations in the number of infected individuals in a network of cities between which individuals commute. The frequency and amplitude of these oscillations is known to be very well captured by the van Kampen system-size expansion, and we use this approximation to compute the complex coherence function that describes their correlation. We find that, if the infection rate differs from city to city and the coupling between them is not too strong, these oscillations are synchronised with a well defined phase lag between cities. The analytic description of the effect is shown to be in good agreement with the results of stochastic simulations for realistic population sizes.",Human
"One of the main applications of balance indices is in tests of null models of evolutionary processes. The knowledge of an exact formula for a statistic of a balance index, holding for any number n of leaves, is necessary in order to use this statistic in tests of this kind involving trees of any size. In this paper we obtain exact formulas for the variance under the Yule model of the Sackin index, the Colless index and the total cophenetic index of binary rooted phylogenetic trees with n leaves. We also obtain the covariance of the Sackin and the total cophenetic index.",Human
"The light-harvesting is a problem of long interest. It becomes active again in recent years stimulated by suggestions of quantum effects in energy transport. Recent experiments found evidence that BChla 1 and BChla 6 are the first to be excited in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson(FMO) protein, theoretical studies, however, are mostly restricted to consider the exciton in BChla 1 initially. In this paper, we study the energy transport in the FMO complex by taking different initial states into account. Optimizations are performed for the decoherence rates as to maximal transport efficiency. Dependence of the energy transfer efficiency on the initial states is given and discussed. Effects of fluctuations in the site energies and couplings are also examined.",Human
"In a previous paper (S. Ghosal and Z. Chen Bull. Math. Biol. 2010, vol. 72, pg. 2047) it was shown that the evolution of the solute concentration in capillary electrophoresis is described by a nonlinear wave equation that reduced to Burger's equation if the nonlinearity was weak. It was assumed that only strong electrolytes (fully dissociated) were present. In the present paper it is shown that the same governing equation also describes the situation where the electrolytic buffer consists of a single weak acid (or base). A simple approximate formula is derived for the dimensionless peak variance which is shown to agree well with published experimental data.",Human
"The simple circadian oscillator found in cyanobacteria can be reconstituted in vitro using three proteins-KaiA, KaiB and KaiC. The total phosphorylation level of KaiC oscillates with a circadian period. Recent experiments elucidated the structure and function of the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator, which is driven by sunlight intensity variation and therefore by Earth's rotation. In this paper, we derive the oscillator's equation of motion directly from experimental data, couple it with Earth's rotation and compute its natural periods and resonance curve. Finally, we propose the use of a quantum circuit that is capable of describing the function of the oscillator.",Human
Recent experiments suggest that membranes of living cells are tuned close to a miscibility critical point in the 2D Ising universality class. We propose that one role for this proximity to criticality in live cells is to provide a conduit for relatively long-ranged critical Casimir forces. Using techniques from conformal field theory we calculate potentials of mean force between membrane bound inclusions mediated by their local interactions with the composition order parameter. We verify these calculations using Monte-Carlo where we also compare critical and off-critical results. Our findings suggest that membrane bound proteins experience weak yet long range forces mediated by critical composition fluctuations in the plasma membranes of living cells.,Human
"Genome-wide protein-protein interaction (PPI) data are readily available thanks to recent breakthroughs in biotechnology. However, PPI networks of extant organisms are only snapshots of the network evolution. How to infer the whole evolution history becomes a challenging problem in computational biology. In this paper, we present a likelihood-based approach to inferring network evolution history from the topology of PPI networks and the duplication relationship among the paralogs. Simulations show that our approach outperforms the existing ones in terms of the accuracy of reconstruction. Moreover, the growth parameters of several real PPI networks estimated by our method are more consistent with the ones predicted in literature.",Human
"In complex systems, the interplay between nonlinear and stochastic dynamics, e.g., J. Monod's necessity and chance, gives rise to an evolutionary process in Darwinian sense, in terms of discrete jumps among attractors, with punctuated equilibrium, spontaneous random ""mutations"" and ""adaptations"". On an evlutionary time scale it produces sustainable diversity among individuals in a homogeneous population rather than convergence as usually predicted by a deterministic dynamics. The emergent discrete states in such a system, i.e., attractors, have natural robustness against both internal and external perturbations. Phenotypic states of a biological cell, a mesoscopic nonlinear stochastic open biochemical system, could be understood through such a perspective.",Human
"We use a recently developed coarse-grained model for DNA to study kissing complexes formed by hybridization of complementary hairpin loops. The binding of the loops is topologically constrained because their linking number must remain constant. By studying systems with linking numbers -1, 0 or 1 we show that the average number of interstrand base pairs is larger when the topology is more favourable for the right-handed wrapping of strands around each other. The thermodynamic stability of the kissing complex also decreases when the linking number changes from -1 to 0 to 1. The structures of the kissing complexes typically involve two intermolecular helices that coaxially stack with the hairpin stems at a parallel four-way junction.",Human
"Multistep denaturation in a short circular DNA molecule is analyzed by a mesoscopic Hamiltonian model which accounts for the helicoidal geometry. Computation of melting profiles by the path integral method suggests that stacking anharmonicity stabilizes the double helix against thermal disruption of the hydrogen bonds. Twisting is essential in the model to capture the importance of nonlinear effects on the thermodynamical properties. In a ladder model with zero twist, anharmonic stacking scarcely affects the thermodynamics. Moderately untwisted helices, with respect to the equilibrium conformation, show an energetic advantage against the overtwisted ones. Accordingly moderately untwisted helices better sustain local fluctuational openings and make more unlikely the thermally driven complete strand separation.",Human
"In this paper we develop mathematical models for collective cell motility. Initially we develop a model using a linear diffusion-advection type equation and fit the parameters to data from cell motility assays. This approach is helpful in classifying the results of cell motility assay experiments. In particular, this model can determine degrees of directed versus undirected collective cell motility. Next we develop a model using a nonlinear diffusion term that is able capture in a unified way directed and undirected collective cell motility. Finally we apply the nonlinear diffusion approach to a problem in tumor cell invasion, noting that neither chemotaxis or haptotaxis are present in the system under consideration in this article.",Human
"The cytosol state in living cell is treated as homogeneous phase equilibrium with a special feature: the pressure of one phase is positive and the pressure of the other is negative. From this point of view the cytosol is neither solution nor gel (or sol as a whole) regardless its components (water and dissolved substances). This is its unique capability for selecting, sorting and transporting reagents to the proper place of the living cell without a so-called ""pipeline"". To base this statement the theoretical investigation of the conditions of equilibrium and stability of the medium with alternative-sign pressure is carried out under using the thermodynamic laws and the Gibbs' equilibrium criterium.",Human
"We study DNA self-assembly and DNA computation using a coarse-grained DNA model within the directional dynamic bonding framework {[}C. Svaneborg, Comp. Phys. Comm. 183, 1793 (2012){]}. In our model, a single nucleotide or domain is represented by a single interaction site. Complementary sites can reversibly hybridize and dehybridize during a simulation. This bond dynamics induces a dynamics of the angular and dihedral bonds, that model the collective effects of chemical structure on the hybridization dynamics. We use the DNA model to perform simulations of the self-assembly kinetics of DNA tetrahedra, an icosahedron, as well as strand displacement operations used in DNA computation.",Human
"We study time averages of single particle trajectories in scale free anomalous diffusion processes, in which the measurement starts at some time t_a>0 after initiation of the process at the time origin, t=0. Using ageing renewal theory we show that for such non-stationary processes a large class of observables are affected by a unique ageing function, which is independent of boundary conditions or the external forces. We quantify the weakly non-ergodic nature of this process in terms of the distribution of time averages and the ergodicity breaking parameter which both explicitly depend on the ageing time t_a. Consequences for the interpretation of single particle tracking data are discussed.",Human
"Recently the A/H1N1-2009 virus pandemic appeared in Mexico and in other nations. We present a study of this pandemic in the Mexican case using the SIR model to describe epidemics. This model is one of the simplest models but it has been a successful description of some epidemics of closed populations. We consider the data for the Mexican case and use the SIR model to make some predictions. Then, we generalize the SIR model in order to describe the spatial dynamics of the disease. We make a study of the spatial and temporal spread of the infected population with model parameters that are consistent with temporal SIR model parameters obtained by fitting to the Mexican case.",Human
"Using a minimal model of cells or cohesive cell layers as continuum active elastic media, we examine the effect of substrate thickness and stiffness on traction forces exerted by strongly adhering cells. We obtain a simple expression for the length scale controlling the spatial variation of stresses in terms of cell and substrate parameters that describes the crossover between the thin and thick substrate limits. Our model is an important step towards a unified theoretical description of the dependence of traction forces on cell or colony size, acto-myosin contractility, substrate depth and stiffness, and strength of focal adhesions, and makes experimentally testable predictions.",Human
"Biochemical reaction networks are subjected to large fluctuations attributable to small molecule numbers, yet underlie reliable biological functions. Most theoretical approaches describe them as purely deterministic or stochastic dynamical systems, depending on which point of view is favored. Here, we investigate the dynamics of a self-repressing gene using an intermediate approach based on a moment closure approximation of the master equation, which allows us to take into account the binary character of gene activity. We thereby obtain deterministic equations that describe how nonlinearity feeds back fluctuations into the mean-field equations, providing insight into the interplay of determinism and stochasticity. This allows us to identify regions of parameter space where fluctuations induce relatively regular oscillations.",Human
"The copy number of any protein fluctuates among cells in a population; characterizing and understanding these fluctuations is a fundamental problem in biophysics. We show here that protein distributions measured under a broad range of biological realizations collapse to a single non-Gaussian curve under scaling by the first two moments. Moreover in all experiments the variance is found to depend quadratically on the mean, showing that a single degree of freedom determines the entire distribution. Our results imply that protein fluctuations do not reflect any specific molecular or cellular mechanism, and suggest that some buffering process masks these details and induces universality.",Human
"In a variety of biological processes, eukaryotic cells use cilia to transport flow. Although cilia have a remarkably conserved internal molecular structure, experimental observations report very diverse kinematics. To address this diversity, we determine numerically the kinematics and energetics of the most efficient cilium. Specifically, we compute the time-periodic deformation of a wall-bound elastic filament leading to transport of a surrounding fluid at minimum energetic cost, where the cost is taken to be the positive work done by all internal molecular motors. The optimal kinematics are found to strongly depend on the cilium bending rigidity through a single dimensionless number, the Sperm number, and closely resemble the two-stroke ciliary beating pattern observed experimentally.",Human
"The network approach became a widely used tool to understand the behaviour of complex systems in the last decade. We start from a short description of structural rigidity theory. A detailed account on the combinatorial rigidity analysis of protein structures, as well as local flexibility measures of proteins and their applications in explaining allostery and thermostability is given. We also briefly discuss the network aspects of cytoskeletal tensegrity. Finally, we show the importance of the balance between functional flexibility and rigidity in protein-protein interaction, metabolic, gene regulatory and neuronal networks. Our summary raises the possibility that the concepts of flexibility and rigidity can be generalized to all networks.",Human
"The steady state of the two-substance model of light driven carbon turnover for the photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate is presented. The model is based on the nonlinear diffusion equation for a single chloroplast in the elliptical geometry by assuming light driven Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration and CO2 assimilation reaction of carboxilation coupled with the photosynthetic sink strength. The detailed analysis of 3 -dimensional CO2 concentration and flux on the chloroplast level is made. It is shown that under intense light irradiation there exists a boundary layer of chloroplasts with a high value of CO2 assimilation flux. The presented simplified model can be used for the calculations and experimental estimations of the CO2 assimilation rate for environmental applications.",Human
"The recently proposed close-packed motif for collagen is investigated using first principles semi-empirical wave function theory and Kohn-Sham density functional theory. Under these refinements the close-packed motif is shown to be stable. For the case of the 7/2 motif a similar stability exists. The electronic circular dichroism of the close-packed model has a significant negative bias and a large signal. An interesting feature of the close-packed structure is the existence of a central channel. Simulations show that, if hydrogen atoms are placed in the cavity, a chain of molecular hydrogens is formed suggesting a possible biological function for molecular hydrogen.",Human
"How networks endure damage is a central issue in neural network research. This includes temporal as well as spatial pattern of damage. Here, based on some very simple models we study the difference between a slow-growing and acute damage and the relation between the size and rate of injury. Our result shows that in both a three-layer and a homeostasis model a slow-growing damage has a decreasing effect on network disability as compared with a fast growing one. This finding is in accord with clinical reports where the state of patients before and after the operation for slow-growing injuries is much better that those patients with acute injuries.",Human
"Dynamics in biological networks are in general robust against several perturbations. We investigate a coupled map network as a model motivated by gene regulatory networks and design systems which are robust against phenotypic perturbations (perturbations in dynamics), as well as systems which are robust against mutation (perturbations in network structure). To achieve such a design, we apply a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. Analysis based on the maximum Lyapunov exponent and parameter sensitivity shows that systems with marginal stability, which are regarded as systems at the edge of chaos, emerge when robustness against network perturbations is required. This emergence of the edge of chaos is a self-organization phenomenon and does not need a fine tuning of parameters.",Human
"It is well known since the pioneering work of Goldbeter and Koshland [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 78, pp. 6840-6844 (1981)] that cellular phosphorylation- dephosphorylation cycle (PdPC), catalyzed by kinase and phosphatase under saturated condition with zeroth order enzyme kinetics, exhibits ultrasensitivity, sharp transition. We analyse the dynamics aspects of the zeroth order PdPC kinetics and show a critical slowdown akin to the phase transition in condensed matter physics. We demonstrate that an extremely simple, though somewhat mathematically ""singular"" model is a faithful representation of the ultrasentivity phenomenon. The simplified mathematical model will be valuable, as a component, in developing complex cellular signaling network theory as well as having a pedagogic value.",Human
"The composition of narrow distribution poly ethylene oxide-propylene oxide copolymer (Mw ~ 8700 Da) was studied using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. The ethylene oxide-propylene oxide copolymer produced oligomers separated by 14 Da. The average resolving power over the entire spectrum was 28,000. Approximately 448 isotopically resolved peaks representing about 56 oligomers are identified. Although agreement between experimental and calculated isotopic distributions was strong, the compositional assignment was difficult. This is due to the large number of possible isobaric components. The purpose of this research is to resolve and study the composition of high mass copolymer such as ethylene oxide-propylene oxide.",Human
"The question of the value of the pitch angle of DNA is visited from the perspective of a geometrical analysis of transcription. It is suggested that for transcription to be possible, the pitch angle of B-DNA must be smaller than the angle of zero-twist. At the zero-twist angle the double helix is maximally rotated and its strain-twist coupling vanishes. A numerical estimate of the pitch angle for B-DNA based on differential geometry is compared with numbers obtained from existing empirical data. The crystallographic studies shows that the pitch angle is approximately 38 deg., less than the corresponding zero-twist angle of 41.8 deg., which is consistent with the suggested principle for transcription.",Human
The yield of chemical reactions involving intermediate radical pairs is influenced by magnetic fields well beyond the levels expected from energy considerations. This dependence can be traced back to the microscopic dynamics of electron spins and constitutes the basis of the chemical compass. Here we propose a new experimental approach based on molecular photoswitches to achieve additional control on the chemical reaction and to allow short-time resolution of the spin dynamics. Our proposal enables experiments to test some of the standard assumptions of the radical pair model and improves the sensitivity of chemical magnetometers by two orders of magnitude.,Human
"Cross-linked actomyosin bundles retract when severed in vivo by laser ablation, or when isolated from the cell and micromanipulated in vitro in the presence of ATP. We identify the time scale for contraction as a viscoelastic time tau, where the viscosity is due to (internal) protein friction. We obtain an estimate of the order of magnitude of the contraction time tau ~ 10-100 s, consistent with available experimental data for circumferential microfilament bundles and stress fibers. Our results are supported by an exactly solvable, hydrodynamic model of a retracting bundle as a cylinder of isotropic, active matter, from which the order of magnitude of the active stress is estimated.",Human
"Recently, several works have analysed the efficiency of photosynthetic complexes in a transient scenario and how that efficiency is affected by environmental noise. Here, following a quantum master equation approach, we study the energy and excitation transport in fully connected networks both in general and in the particular case of the Fenna-Matthew-Olson complex. The analysis is carried out for the steady state of the system where the excitation energy is constantly ""flowing"" through the system. Steady state transport scenarios are particularly relevant if the evolution of the quantum system is not conditioned on the arrival of individual excitations. By adding dephasing to the system, we analyse the possibility of noise-enhancement of the quantum transport.",Human
"We report numerical simulations of membrane tubulation driven by large colloidal particles. Using Monte Carlo simulations we study how the process depends on particle size, concentration and binding strength, and present accurate free energy calculations to sort out how tube formation compares with the competing budding process. We find that tube formation is a result of the collective behavior of the particles adhering on the surface, and it occurs for binding strengths that are smaller than those required for budding. We also find that long linear aggregates of particles forming on the membrane surface act as nucleation seeds for tubulation by lowering the free energy barrier associated to the process.",Human
"The expansion of tools against HIV transmission has brought increased interest in epidemiological models that can predict the impact of these interventions. The EMOD-HIV model was recently compared to eleven other independently developed mathematical models of HIV transmission to determine the extent to which they agree about the potential impact of expanded use of antiretroviral therapy in South Africa. Here we describe in detail the modeling methodology used to produce the results in this comparison, which we term EMOD-HIV v0.7. We include a discussion of the structure and a full list of model parameters. We also discuss the architecture of the model, and its potential utility in comparing structural assumptions within a single modeling framework.",Human
"In this paper, we model a microtubule based on its dimer resolution structure. First, the fundamental structural components were studied and then electrostatic potential function for a single monomer was calculated. Subsequently, the potential function inside a single monomer due to a ring of dimers was obtained. Considering the potential due to protofilament-protofilament interaction with a monomer in a B crystal structure of a microtubule, we obtain a double well potential wall. Quantum mechanically the ions can pass through this wall because of the Tunnelling effect. We solve the time independent Schrodinger Equation, calculate the transmission efficiency of ion flow and use the latter in the calculation of ion current density.",Human
"We analyse a large data set of genetic markers obtained from populations of Cymodocea nodosa, a marine plant occurring from the East Mediterranean to the Iberian-African coasts in the Atlantic Ocean. We fully develop and test a recently introduced methodology to infer the directionality of gene flow based on the concept of geographical segregation. Using the Jensen-Shannon divergence, we are able to extract a directed network of gene flow describing the evolutionary patterns of Cymodocea nodosa. In particular we recover the genetic segregation that the marine plant underwent during its evolution. The results are confirmed by natural evidence and are consistent with an independent cross analysis.",Human
One of the principal models of magnetic sensing in migratory birds rests on the quantum spin-dynamics of transient radical pairs created photochemically in ocular cryptochrome proteins. We consider here the role of electron spin entanglement and coherence in determining the sensitivity of a radical pair-based geomagnetic compass and the origins of the directional response. It emerges that the anisotropy of radical pairs formed from spin-polarized molecular triplets could form the basis of a more sensitive compass sensor than one founded on the conventional hyperfine-anisotropy model. This property offers new and more flexible opportunities for the design of biologically inspired magnetic compass sensors.,Human
"The fields of structural biology and soft matter have independently sought out fundamental principles to rationalize protein crystallization. Yet the conceptual differences and the limited overlap between the two disciplines have thus far prevented a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon to emerge. We conduct a computational study of proteins from the rubredoxin family that bridges the two fields. Using atomistic simulations, we characterize their crystal contacts, and accordingly parameterize patchy particle models. Comparing the phase diagrams of these schematic models with experimental results enables us to critically examine the assumptions behind the two approaches. The study also reveals features of protein-protein interactions that can be leveraged to crystallize proteins more generally.",Human
We report the kinetic analysis of free radicals on fungal spores of Penicillium digitatum interacted with atomic oxygen generated plasma electric discharge using real time in situ electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. We have obtained information that the ESR signal from the spores was observed and preliminarily assignable to semiquinone radical with a g-value of around 2.004 and a line width of approximately 5G. The decay of the signal is possibly linked to the inactivation of the fungal spore. The real-time in situ ESR has proven to be a useful method to elucidate plasma-induced surface reactions on biological specimens.,Human
"Quantum noise places a fundamental limit on the per photon sensitivity attainable in optical measurements. This limit is of particular importance in biological measurements, where the optical power must be constrained to avoid damage to the specimen. By using non-classically correlated light, we demonstrated that the quantum limit can be surpassed in biological measurements. Quantum enhanced microrheology was performed within yeast cells by tracking naturally occurring lipid granules with sensitivity 2.4 dB beyond the quantum noise limit. The viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm could thereby be determined with a 64% improved measurement rate. This demonstration paves the way to apply quantum resources broadly in a biological context.",Human
"We study theoretically the shapes of biological tubes affected by various pathologies. When epithelial cells grow at an uncontrolled rate, the negative tension produced by their division provokes a buckling instability. Several shapes are investigated : varicose, enlarged, sinusoidal or sausage-like, all of which are found in pathologies of tracheal, renal tubes or arteries. The final shape depends crucially on the mechanical parameters of the tissues : Young modulus, wall-to-lumen ratio, homeostatic pressure. We argue that since tissues must be in quasistatic mechanical equilibrium, abnormal shapes convey information as to what causes the pathology. We calculate a phase diagram of tubular instabilities which could be a helpful guide for investigating the underlying genetic regulation.",Human
"Using an experimental optimization approach, this study investigated whether two human movements, pointing tasks and squat-jumps, could be modelled with a reduced set of kinematic parameters. Three sigmoid models were proposed to model the evolution of joint angles. The models parameters were optimized to fit the 2D position of the joints obtained from 304 pointing tasks and 120 squat-jumps. The models were accurate for both movements. This study provides a new framework to model planar movements with a small number of meaningful kinematic parameters, allowing a continuous description of both kinematics and kinetics. Further researches should investigate the implication of the control parameters in relation to motor control and validate this approach for three dimensional movements.",Human
"Complex systems, in many different scientific sectors, show coarse-grain properties with simple growth laws with respect to fundamental microscopic algorithms. We propose a classification scheme of growth laws which includes human aging, tumor (and/or tissue) growth, logistic and generalized logistic growth and the aging of technical devices. The proposed classification permits to evaluate the aging/failure of combined new bio-technical ""manufactured products"", where part of the system evolves in time according to biological-mortality laws and part according to technical device behaviors. Moreover it suggests a direct relation between the mortality leveling-off for humans and technical devices and the observed small cure probability for large tumors.",Human
"Existing state-of-the-art methods that take a single RNA sequence and predict the corresponding RNA secondary-structure are thermodynamic methods. These predict the most stable RNA structure, but do not consider the process of structure formation. We have by now ample experimental and theoretical evidence, however, that sequences in vivo fold while being transcribed and that the process of structure formation matters. We here present a conceptually new method for predicting RNA secondary-structure, called CoFold, that combines thermodynamic with kinetic considerations. Our method significantly improves the state-of-art in terms of prediction accuracy, especially for long sequences of more than a thousand nucleotides length such as ribosomal RNAs.",Human
"We present force-clamp data on the collapse of ubiquitin polyproteins in response to a quench in the force. These nonequilibrium trajectories are analyzed using a general method based on a diffusive assumption of the end-to-end length to reconstruct a downhill free energy profile at 5pN and an energy plateau at 10pN with a slow diffusion coefficient on the order of~100nm^2/s. The shape of the free energy and its linear scaling with the protein length give validity to a physical model for the collapse. However, the length independent diffusion coefficient suggests that internal rather than viscous friction dominates and thermal noise is needed to capture the variability in the measured times to collapse.",Human
"We estimated the aerial biomass and stored carbon in twelve types of forests in the department of C\'ordoba with annual rain fall ranging from 3000 mm (super humid climates) to 1300 mm (semi-humid climate). Biomass was estimated based on structural aspects of the vegetation (diameter at breast height, total height, and wood specific weight). We tested nine allometric equations for tropical forests available in the literature and selected those proposed by Chave et al (2005) that are specific for humid and dry forests. Carbon content in trees was measured in four tissues (stem, branch, bark, and leafs) through an automated dry combustion method, which estimates the percentage of carbon in a sample of known weight.",Human
"Flowing blood displays a phenomenon called margination, in which leukocytes and platelets are preferentially found near blood vessel walls, while erythrocytes are depleted from these regions. Here margination is investigated using direct hydrodynamic simulations of a binary suspension of stiff (s) and floppy (f) capsules, as well as a stochastic model that incorporates the key particle transport mechanisms in suspensions -- wall-induced hydrodynamic migration and shear-induced pair collisions. The stochastic model allows the relative importance of these two mechanisms to be directly evaluated and thereby indicates that margination, at least in the dilute case, is largely due to the differential dynamics of homogeneous (e.g. s-s) and heterogeneous (s-f) collisions",Human
"The ability of migratory birds to orient relative to the Earth's magnetic field is believed to involve a coherent superposition of two spin states of a radical electron pair. However, the mechanism by which this coherence can be maintained in the face of strong interactions with the cellular environment has remained unclear. This Letter addresses the problem of decoherence between two electron spins due to hyperfine interaction with a bath of spin 1/2 nuclei. Dynamics of the radical pair density matrix are derived and shown to yield a simple mechanism for sensing magnetic field orientation. Rates of dephasing and decoherence are calculated ab initio and found to yield millisecond coherence times, consistent with behavioral experiments.",Human
A mesoscopic model which allows us to identify and quantify the strength of binding sites in DNA sequences is proposed. The model is based on the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model for the DNA chain coupled to a Brownian particle which explores the sequence interacting more importantly with open base pairs of the DNA chain. We apply the model to promoter sequences of different organisms. The free energy landscape obtained for these promoters shows a complex structure that is strongly connected to their biological behavior. The analysis method used is able to quantify free energy differences of sites within genome sequences.,Human
"We studied the curvature-driven roughening of a disk domain pattern with a variable interface window. The relaxation of interface is driven by negative surface tension . When a domain boundary propagates radially at a constant rate, we found that evolution of interface roughness follows scaling dynamic behavior. The local growth exponents are substantially different from the global exponents. Curvature-driven roughening belongs to a new class of anomalous roughening dynamics. However, a different surface tension leads to different global exponents. This is different from that of interface evolution with a fixed-size window, which has universal exponent. The variable growth window leads to a new class of anomalous roughening dynamics.",Human
"It is believed that the quantum coherence itself cannot explain the very high excitation energy transfer (EET) efficiency in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. In this paper, we show that this is not the case if the inter-site couplings take complex values. By phenomenologically introducing phases into the inter-site couplings, we obtain the EET efficiency as high as 0.8972 in contrast to 0.6781 with real inter-site couplings. Dependence of the excitation energy transfer efficiency on the initial states is elaborated. Effects of fluctuations in the site energies and inter-site couplings are also examined.",Human
"Self-replication is a capacity common to every species of living thing, and simple physical intuition dictates that such a process must invariably be fueled by the production of entropy. Here, we undertake to make this intuition rigorous and quantitative by deriving a lower bound for the amount of heat that is produced during a process of self-replication in a system coupled to a thermal bath. We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.",Human
We have developed a mathematical model for in-host virus dynamics that includes spatial chemotaxis and diffusion across a two dimensional surface representing the vaginal or rectal epithelium at primary HIV infection. A linear stability analysis of the steady state solutions identified conditions for Turing instability pattern formation. We have solved the model equations numerically using parameter values obtained from previous experimental results for HIV infections. Simulations of the model for this surface show hot spots of infection. Understanding this localization is an important step in the ability to correctly model early HIV infection. These spatial variations also have implications for the development and effectiveness of microbicides against HIV.,Human
"While modern structural biology has provided us with a rich and diverse picture of membrane proteins, the biological function of membrane proteins is often influenced by the mechanical properties of the surrounding lipid bilayer. Here we explore the relation between the shape of membrane proteins and the cooperative function of membrane proteins induced by membrane-mediated elastic interactions. For the experimental model system of mechanosensitive ion channels we find that the sign and strength of elastic interactions depend on the protein shape, yielding distinct cooperative gating curves for distinct protein orientations. Our approach predicts how directional elastic interactions affect the molecular structure, organization, and biological function of proteins in crowded membranes.",Human
"In a single molecule assay, the motion of a molecular motor is often inferred from measuring the stochastic trajectory of a large probe particle attached to it. We discuss a simple model for this generic set-up taking into account explicitly the elastic coupling between probe and motor. The combined dynamics consists of discrete steps of the motor and continuous Brownian motion of the probe. Motivated by recent experiments on the F1-ATPase, we investigate three types of efficiencies both in simulations and a Gaussian approximation. Overall, we obtain good quantitative agreement with the experimental data. In particular, we clarify the conditions under which one of these efficiencies becomes larger than one.",Human
"Using a network representation for real soil samples and mathematical models for microbial spread, we show that the structural heterogeneity of the soil habitat may have a very significant influence on the size of microbial invasions of the soil pore space. In particular, neglecting the soil structural heterogeneity may lead to a substantial underestimation of microbial invasion. Such effects are explained in terms of a crucial interplay between heterogeneity in microbial spread and heterogeneity in the topology of soil networks. The main influence of network topology on invasion is linked to the existence of long channels in soil networks that may act as bridges for transmission of microorganisms between distant parts of soil.",Human
"We use a recently developed coarse-grained model to simulate the overstretching of duplex DNA. Overstretching at 23C occurs at 74 pN in the model, about 6-7 pN higher than the experimental value at equivalent salt conditions. Furthermore, the model reproduces the temperature dependence of the overstretching force well. The mechanism of overstretching is always force-induced melting by unpeeling from the free ends. That we never see S-DNA (overstretched duplex DNA), even though there is clear experimental evidence for this mode of overstretching under certain conditions, suggests that S-DNA is not simply an unstacked but hydrogen-bonded duplex, but instead probably has a more exotic structure.",Human
"In this paper, by using a stochastic reaction-diffusion-taxis model, we analyze the picophytoplankton dynamics in the basin of the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by poorly mixed waters. The model includes intraspecific competition of picophytoplankton for light and nutrients. The multiplicative noise sources present in the model account for random fluctuations of environmental variables. Phytoplankton distributions obtained from the model show a good agreement with experimental data sampled in two different sites of the Sicily Channel. The results could be extended to analyze data collected in different sites of the Mediterranean Sea and to devise predictive models for phytoplankton dynamics in oligotrophic waters.",Human
"The scaling of transient times to zero-lag synchronization in networks composed of excitable units is shown to be governed by three features of the graph representing the network: the longest path between pairs of neurons (diameter), the largest loop (circumference) and the loop with the maximal average out degree. The upper bound of transient times can vary between O(1) and O(N2), where N is the size of the network, and its scaling can be predicted in many scenarios from finite time accumulated information of the transient. Results challenge the assumption that functionality of neural networks might depend solely upon the synchronized repeated activation such as zero-lag synchronization.",Human
"Molecular diffusion measurements are widely used to probe microstructure in materials and living organisms noninvasively. The precise relation of diffusion metrics to microstructure remains a major challenge: In complex samples, it is often unclear which structural features are most relevant and can be quantified. Here we classify the structural complexity in terms of the long time tail exponent in the molecular velocity autocorrelation function. The specific values of the dynamical exponent let us identify the relevant tissue microanatomy affecting water diffusion measured with MRI in muscles and in brain, and the microstructural changes in ischemic stroke. Our framework presents a systematic way to identify the most relevant part of structural complexity using transport measured with a variety of techniques.",Human
"Highly correlated brain dynamics produces synchronized states with no behavioral value, while weakly correlated dynamics prevent information flow. In between these states, the unique dynamical features of the critical state endow the brain with properties which are fundamental for adaptive behavior. We discuss the idea put forward two decades ago by Per Bak that the working brain stays at an intermediate (critical) regime characterized by power-law correlations. This proposal is now supported by a wide body of empirical evidence at different scales demonstrating that the spatiotemporal brain dynamics exhibit key signatures of critical dynamics, previously recognized in other complex systems. The rationale behind this program is discussed in these notes, followed by an account of the most recent results.",Human
"Combining extensive molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayer systems of varying chemical composition with single-trajectory analyses we systematically elucidate the stochastic nature of the lipid motion. We observe subdiffusion over more than four orders of magnitude in time, clearly stretching into the sub-microsecond domain. The lipid motion delicately depends on the lipid chemistry, the lipid phase, and especially on the presence of cholesterol. We demonstrate that fractional Langevin equation motion universally describes the lipid motion in all phases including the gel phase, and in the presence of cholesterol. The results underline the relevance of anomalous diffusion in lipid bilayers and the strong effects of the membrane composition.",Human
"The basic mechanics of evolution have been understood since Darwin. But debate continues over whether macroevolutionary phenomena are driven primary by the fitness structure of genotype space or by ecological interaction. In this paper we propose a simple, abstract model capturing some key features of fitness-landscape and ecological models of evolution. Our model describes evolutionary dynamics in a high-dimensional, structured genotype space with a significant role for interspecific interaction. We find some promising qualitative similarity with the empirical facts about macroevolution, including broadly distributed extinction sizes and realistic exploration of the genotype space. The abstraction of our model permits numerous interpretations and applications beyond macroevolution, including molecular evolution and technological innovation.",Human
"The evidence that Flowering Locus T (FT) protein and its paralog Twin Sister of FT, act as the long distance floral stimulus, or at least that they are part of it in diverse plant species, has attracted much attention in recent years. Studies to understand the physiological and molecular apparatuses that integrate spatial and temporal signals to regulate developmental transition in plants have occupied countless scientists and have resulted in an unmanageably large amount of research data. Analysis of these data has helped to identify multiple systemic florigenic and antiflorigenic regulators. This study gives an overview of the recent research on gene products, phytohormones and other metabolites that have been demonstrated to have florigenic or antiflorigenic functions in plants.",Human
"In a multicellular organism different cell types express a gene in different amounts. Samples from which gene expression levels can be measured typically contain a mixture of different cell types, the resulting measurements thus give only averages over the different cell types present. Based on fluctuations in the mixture proportions from sample to sample it is in principle possible to reconstruct the underlying expression levels of each cell type: to deconvolute the sample. We use a statistical mechanics approach to the problem of deconvoluting such partial concentrations from mixed samples, give analytical results for when and how well samples can be unmixed, and suggest an algorithm for sample deconvolution.",Human
"Global dynamical behaviors of the competitive Lotka-Volterra system even in 3-dimension are not fully understood. The Lyapunov function can provide us such knowledge once it is constructed. In this paper, we construct explicitly the Lyapunov function in three examples of the competitive Lotka-Volterra system for the whole state space: (1) the general 2-dimensional case; (2) a 3-dimensional model; (3) the model of May-Leonard. The dynamics of these examples include bistable case and cyclical behavior. The first two examples are the generalized gradient system defined in the Appendixes, while the model of May-Leonard is not. Our method is helpful to understand the limit cycle problems in general 3-dimensional case.",Human
"Some mathematical models for the estimation of the effects of Cry1Ab and Cry1F Bt-maize exposure in the biodiversity are discussed. Novel results about these models are obtained and described in the note. The exact formula for the proportion of the population that suffers mortality exposed to Cry1Ab pollen, underlining its dependence on the margin from the Bt crop edge, is derived. In addition, regarding Cry1F pollen effects, it is proposed a procedure, using a probabilistic and statistical approach, that computes the width of the non Bt-stripes used as mitigation measures. Finally, it has been derived a lower bound, using probabilistic consideration, on the species sensitivity of Lepidoptera.",Human
"In this essay we elaborate on recent evidence demonstrating the presence of a second order phase transition in human brain dynamics and discuss its consequences for theoretical approaches to brain function. We review early evidence of criticality in brain dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales, and we stress how it was necessary to unify concepts and analysis techniques across scales to introduce the adequate order and control parameters which define the transition. A discussion on the relation between structural vs. dynamical complexity exposes future steps to understand the dynamics of the connectome (structure) from which emerges the cognitome (function).",Human
"We review the mathematical formalism underlying the modelling of stochasticity in biological systems. Beginning with a description of the system in terms of its basic constituents, we derive the mesoscopic equations governing the dynamics which generalise the more familiar macroscopic equations. We apply this formalism to the analysis of two specific noise-induced phenomena observed in biologically-inspired models. In the first example, we show how the stochastic amplification of a Turing instability gives rise to spatial and temporal patterns which may be understood within the linear noise approximation. The second example concerns the spontaneous emergence of cell polarity, where we make analytic progress by exploiting a separation of time-scales.",Human
"The syncytial cells of a filamentous fungus consist of a mass of growing, tube-like hyphae. Each extending tip is fed by a continuous flow of nuclei from the colony interior, pushed by a gradient in turgor pressure. The myco-fluidic flows of nuclei are complex and multidirectional, like traffic in a city. We map out the flows in a strain of the model filamentous fungus {\it N. crassa} that has been transformed so that nuclei express either hH1-dsRed (a red fluorescent nuclear protein) or hH1-GFP (a green-fluorescent protein) and report our results in a fluid dynamics video.",Human
"We introduce a system of light driven microscopic autonomous moving particles that move on a flat surface. The design is simple, yet effective: Micrometer sized objects with wedge shape are produced by photopolymerization, they are covered with a reflective surface. When the area of motion is illuminated perpendicularly from above, the light is deflected to the side by the wedge shaped objects, in the direction determined by the position and orientation of the particles. The momentum change during reflection provides the driving force for an effectively autonomous motion. The system is an efficient tool to study self propelled microscopic robots.",Human
"One of the most fundamental concepts of evolutionary dynamics is the ""fixation"" probability, i.e. the probability that a mutant spreads through the whole population. Most natural communities are geographically structured into habitats exchanging individuals among each other and can be modeled by an evolutionary graph (EG), where directed links weight the probability for the offspring of one individual to replace another individual in the community. Very few exact analytical results are known for EGs. We show here how by using the techniques of the fixed point of Probability Generating Function, we can uncover a large class of of graphs, which we term bithermal, for which the exact fixation probability can be simply computed.",Human
"Recent experiments on the green alga Chlamydomonas that swims using synchronized beating of a pair of flagella have revealed that it exhibits a run-and-tumble behavior similar to that of bacteria such as E. Coli. Using a simple purely hydrodynamic model that incorporates a stroke cycle and an intrinsic Gaussian white noise, we show that a stochastic run-and-tumble behavior could emerge, due to the nonlinearity of the combined synchronization-rotation-translation dynamics. This suggests the intriguing possibility that the alga might exploit nonlinear mechanics---as opposed to sophisticated biochemical circuitry as used by bacteria---to control its behavior.",Human
"We introduce a system for experimental evolution consisting of populations of short oligonucleotides (Oli populations) evolving in a modified quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). It is tractable at the genetic, genomic, phenotypic and fitness levels. The Oli system uses DNA hairpins designed to form structures that self-prime under defined conditions. Selection acts on the phenotype of self-priming, after which differences in fitness are amplified and quantified using qPCR. We outline the methodological and bioinformatics tools for the Oli system here, and demonstrate that it can be used as a conventional experimental evolution model system by test-driving it in an experiment investigating adaptive evolution under different rates of environmental change.",Human
"We present a minimal continuum model of strongly adhering cells as active contractile isotropic media and use the model to study the effect of the geometry of the adhesion patch in controlling the spatial distribution of traction and cellular stresses. Activity is introduced as a contractile, hence negative, spatially homogeneous contribution to the pressure. The model shows that patterning of adhesion regions can be used to control traction stress distribution and yields several results consistent with experimental observations. Specifically, the cell spread area is found to increase with substrate stiffness and an analytic expression for the dependence is obtained for circular cells. The correlation between the magnitude of traction stresses and cell boundary curvature is also demonstrated and analyzed.",Human
"Limited spectrum coverage is a problem in shotgun proteomics. Replicates are generated to improve the spectrum coverage. When integrating peptide identification results obtained from replicates, the state-of-the-art algorithm PeptideProphet combines Peptide-Spectrum Matches (PSMs) before building the statistical model to calculate peptide probabilities.   In this paper, we find the connection between merging results of replicates and Bagging, which is a standard routine to improve the power of statistical methods. Following Bagging's philosophy, we propose to run PeptideProphet separately on each replicate and combine the outputs to obtain the final peptide probabilities. In our experiments, we show that the proposed routine can improve PeptideProphet consistently on a standard protein dataset, a Human dataset and a Yeast dataset.",Human
"Invasion waves are a fundamental building block of theoretical ecology. In this study we aim to take the first steps to link propagation failure and fast acceleration of traveling waves to critical transitions (or tipping points). The approach is based upon a detailed numerical study of various versions of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) equation. The main motivation of this work is to contribute to the following question: how much information do statistics, collected by a stationary observer, contain about the speed and bifurcations of traveling waves? We suggest warning signs based upon closeness to carrying capacity, second-order moments and transients of localized initial invasions.",Human
"Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we investigate the dynamics of polymer translocation into a circular nanocontainer through a nanopore under a driving force $F$. We observe that the translocation probability initially increases and then saturates with increasing $F$, independent of $\phi$, which is the average density of the whole chain in the nanocontainer. The translocation time distribution undergoes a transition from a Gaussian distribution to an asymmetric distribution with increasing $\phi$. Moreover, we find a nonuniversal scaling exponent of the translocation time as chain length, depending on $\phi$ and $F$. These results are interpreted by the conformation of the translocated chain in the nanocontainer and the time of an individual segment passing through the pore during translocation.",Human
"Studies of coevolution of amino acids within and between proteins have revealed two types of coevolving units: coevolving contacts, which are pairs of amino acids distant along the sequence but in contact in the three-dimensional structure, and sectors, which are larger groups of structurally connected amino acids that underlie the biochemical properties of proteins. By reconciling two approaches for analyzing correlations in multiple sequence alignments, we link these two findings together and with coevolving units of intermediate size, called `sectons', which are shown to provide additional information. By extending the analysis to the co-occurrence of orthologous genes in bacterial genomes, we also show that the methods and results are general and relevant beyond protein structures.",Human
"We investigate the microtubule polymerization dynamics with catastrophe and rescue events for three different confinement scenarios, which mimic typical cellular environments: (i) The microtubule is confined by rigid and fixed walls, (ii) it grows under constant force, and (iii) it grows against an elastic obstacle with a linearly increasing force. We use realistic catastrophe models and analyze the microtubule dynamics, the resulting microtubule length distributions, and force generation by stochastic and mean field calculations; in addition, we perform stochastic simulations. We also investigate the force dynamics if growth parameters are perturbed in dilution experiments. Finally, we show the robustness of our results against changes of catastrophe models and load distribution factors.",Human
"We report the experimental verification of noise-enhanced logic behaviour in an electronic analog of a synthetic genetic network, composed of two repressors and two constitutive promoters. We observe good agreement between circuit measurements and numerical prediction, with the circuit allowing for robust logic operations in an optimal window of noise. Namely, the input-output characteristics of a logic gate is reproduced faithfully under moderate noise, which is a manifestation of the phenomenon known as Logical Stochastic Resonance. The two dynamical variables in the system yield complementary logic behaviour simultaneously. The system is easily morphed from AND/NAND to OR/NOR logic.",Human
"Metacommunity theory is considered a promising approach for explaining species diversity and food web complexity. Recently Pillai et al. proposed a simple modeling framework for the dynamics of food webs at the metacommunity level. Here, we employ this framework to compute general conditions for the persistence of complex food webs in metacommunities. The persistence conditions found depend on the connectivity of the resource patches and the structure of the assembled food web, thus linking the underlying spatial patch-network and the species interaction network. We find that the persistence of omnivores is more likely when it is feeding on (a) prey on low trophic levels, and (b) prey on similar trophic levels.",Human
"We report the imaging of tendon, a connective tissue rich in collagen type I proteins, with Interferometric Second Harmonic Generation (I-SHG) microscopy. We observed that the noncentrosymmetric structural organization can be maintained along the fibrillar axis over more than 150 {\mu}m, while in the transverse direction it is ~1-15 {\mu}m. Those results are explained by modeling tendon as a heterogeneous distribution of noncentrosymmetric nanocylinders (collagen fibrils) oriented along the fibrillar axis. The preservation of the noncentrosymmetric structural organization over multiple tens of microns reveals that tendon is made of domains in which the fraction occupied by fibrils oriented in one direction is larger than in the other.",Human
"Various biological sensory systems exhibit a response to a relative change of the stimulus, often referred to as fold-change detection. In the last few years fold-change detecting mechanisms, based on transcriptional networks, have been proposed. Here we present fold-change detecting mechanism, based on protein-protein interactions, consisting of two interacting proteins. This mechanism, in contrast to previously proposed mechanisms, does not consume chemical energy and is not subject to transcriptional and translational noise. We show by analytical and numerical calculations, that the mechanism can have a fast, precise and efficient response for parameters that are relevant to eukaryotic cells.",Human
"The cable equation is a second order, parabolic, partial differential equation that describes the evolution of voltage in the dendrite of a neuron. Here we look at the various ways in which lambda(space constant/ variable space constant/length parameter) is calculated in the cases of linear, passive transmission as well as nonlinear active transmission. Changes in morphology are taken into account by including the case of tapering dendrite, branched dendrites, branched dendrites with taper or flare. The case of variable membrane resistance and the relationship between input resistance and space constant is explored. Finally the reaction diffusion equation governing the diffusion of calcium in dendrites and space constant associated with that is described.",Human
"Calcium dynamics is the highly responsible for intracellular electrical (action potential) and chemical (neurotransmitter) signaling in neuron cell. The Mathematical modeling of calcium dynamics in neurons lead to the reaction diffusion equation which involves the parameters like diffusion coefficient, free calcium, bound calcium, buffers and bound buffer. Here the parameters like receptors, serca and leak are also incorporated in the model. Appropriate boundary conditions have been framed based on biophysical conditions of the problem. The finite volume method has been employed to obtain the solution. The computer program has been developed using MATLAB 7.11 for the entire problem to compute Ca2+ profiles and study the relationships among various parameters.",Human
"Inference of gene regulatory network from expression data is a challenging task. Many methods have been developed to this purpose but a comprehensive evaluation that covers unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised methods, and provides guidelines for their practical application, is lacking.   We performed an extensive evaluation of inference methods on simulated expression data. The results reveal very low prediction accuracies for unsupervised techniques with the notable exception of the z-score method on knock-out data. In all other cases the supervised approach achieved the highest accuracies and even in a semi-supervised setting with small numbers of only positive samples, outperformed the unsupervised techniques.",Human
"Starting from fitness correlation functions, we calculate exact expressions for the amplitude spectra of fitness landscapes as defined by P.F. Stadler [J. Math. Chem. 20, 1 (1996)] for common landscape models, including Kauffman's NK-model, rough Mount Fuji landscapes and general linear superpositions of such landscapes. We further show that correlations decaying exponentially with the Hamming distance yield exponentially decaying spectra similar to those reported recently for a model of molecular signal transduction. Finally, we compare our results for the model systems to the spectra of various experimentally measured fitness landscapes. We claim that our analytical results should be helpful when trying to interpret empirical data and guide the search for improved fitness landscape models.",Human
"Mechanical forces such as fluid shear have been shown to enhance cell growth and differentiation, but knowledge of their mechanistic effect on cells is limited because the local flow patterns and associated metrics are not precisely known. Here we present real-time, noninvasive measures of local hydrodynamics in 3D biomaterials based on nuclear magnetic resonance. Microflow maps were further used to derive pressure, shear and fluid permeability fields. Finally, remodeling of collagen gels in response to precise fluid flow parameters was correlated with structural changes. It is anticipated that accurate flow maps within 3D matrices will be a critical step towards understanding cell behavior in response to controlled flow dynamics.",Human
"Wang-Landau sampling has been applied to investigate the thermodynamics and structural properties of a lattice hydrophobic-polar heteropolymer (the HP protein model) interacting with an attractive substrate. For simplicity, we consider a short HP sequence consisting of only 36 monomers interacting with a substrate which attracts all monomers in the sequence. The conformational ""phase transitions"" have been identified by a canonical analysis of the specific heat and suitable structural observables. Three major ""transitions"", namely, adsorption, hydrophobic core formation and ""flattening"" of adsorbed structures, are observed. Depending on the surface attractive strength relative to the intra-protein attraction among the H monomers, these processes take place in different sequences upon cooling.",Human
"Nanoscale biosensors are devices designed to detect analytes by combining biological components and physicochemical detectors. One of the well known methods of constructing these sensors is by using nanocantilevers. These microscopic 'diving boards' are coated with binding probes that have an affinity to a particular amino acid, enzyme or protein in living organisms. When these probes attract some target particles, such as biomolecules, they change the vibrating frequency of the cantilever. This process is random in nature and produces fluctuations in the frequency and damping of the cantilever. In this paper, we studied the effect of these fluctuations using a stochastically perturbed classical harmonic oscillator.",Human
"We investigate the relationship between communication and search efficiency in a biological context by proposing a model of Brownian searchers with long-range pairwise interaction. After a general study of the properties of the model, we show an application to the particular case of acoustic communication among Mongolian gazelle, for which data are available, searching for good habitat areas. Using Monte Carlo simulations and density equations, our results point out that the search is optimal (i.e. the mean first hitting time among searchers is minimum) at intermediate scales of communication, showing that both an excess and a lack of information may worsen it.",Human
"We characterize cell motion in experiments and show that the transition to collective motion in colonies of gliding bacterial cells confined to a monolayer appears through the organization of cells into larger moving clusters. Collective motion by non-equilibrium cluster formation is detected for a critical cell packing fraction around 17%. This transition is characterized by a scale-free power-law cluster size distribution, with an exponent $0.88\pm0.07$, and the appearance of giant number fluctuations. Our findings are in quantitative agreement with simulations of self-propelled rods. This suggests that the interplay of self-propulsion of bacteria and the rod-shape of bacteria is sufficient to induce collective motion.",Human
"A formalism is developed which describes the extent to which stochastic oscillations in biochemical models are synchronised. It is based on the calculation of the complex coherence function within the linear noise approximation. The method is illustrated on a simple example and then applied to study the synchronisation of chemical concentrations in social amoeba. The degree to which variation of rate constants in different cells and the volume of the cells affects synchronisation of the oscillations is explored, and the phase lag calculated. In all cases the analytical results are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained through numerical simulations.",Human
"Genetic redundancy is ubiquitous and can be found in any organism. However, it has been argued that genetic redundancy reduces total population fitness, and therefore, redundancy is unlikely to evolve. In this letter, we study an evolutionary model with high-dimensional genotype-phenotype mapping (GPM) to investigate the relevance of complexity in GPM to the evolution of genetic redundancy. By applying the replica method to deal with quenched randomness, the redundancy dependence of the fitness is analytically obtained, which demonstrates that genetic redundancy can indeed evolve, provided that the GPM is complex. Our result provides a novel insight into how genetic redundancy evolves.",Human
"Intracellular transport based on molecular motors and its regulation are crucial to the functioning of cells. Filamentary tracks of the cells are abundantly decorated with non-motile microtubule-associated proteins, such as tau. Motivated by experiments on kinesin-tau interactions [Dixit et al. Science 319, 1086 (2008)] we developed a stochastic model of interacting single-headed motor proteins KIF1A that also takes into account the interactions between motor proteins and tau molecules. Our model reproduce experimental observations and predicts significant effects of tau on bound time and run length which suggest an important role of tau in regulation of kinesin-based transport.",Human
"We apply our general method of duality, introduced in [Giardina', Kurchan, Redig, J. Math. Phys. 48, 033301 (2007)], to models of population dynamics. The classical dualities between forward and ancestral processes can be viewed as a change of representation in the classical creation and annihilation operators, both for diffusions dual to coalescents of Kingman's type, as well as for models with finite population size. Next, using SU(1,1) raising and lowering operators, we find new dualities between the Wright-Fisher diffusion with $d$ types and the Moran model, both in presence and absence of mutations. These new dualities relates two forward evolutions. From our general scheme we also identify self-duality of the Moran model.",Human
"In this letter, we present an original demonstration of an associative learning neural network inspired by the famous Pavlov's dogs experiment. A single nanoparticle organic memory field effect transistor (NOMFET) is used to implement each synapse. We show how the physical properties of this dynamic memristive device can be used to perform low power write operations for the learning and implement short-term association using temporal coding and spike timing dependent plasticity based learning. An electronic circuit was built to validate the proposed learning scheme with packaged devices, with good reproducibility despite the complex synaptic-like dynamic of the NOMFET in pulse regime.",Human
"Morphologic diversity is observed across all families of viruses. Yet these supra-molecular assemblies are produced most of the time in a spontaneous way through complex molecular self-assembly scenarios. The modeling of these phenomena remains a challenging problem within the emerging field of Physical Virology. We present in this work a theoretical analysis aiming at highlighting the particular role of configuration entropy in the control of viral particle size distribution. Specializing this model to retroviruses like HIV-1, we predict a new mechanism of entropic control of both RNA uptake into the viral particle, and of the particle's size distribution. Evidence of this peculiar behavior has been recently reported experimentally.",Human
"Self-sustained turbulent structures have been observed in a wide range of living fluids, yet no quantitative theory exists to explain their properties. We report experiments on active turbulence in highly concentrated 3D suspensions of Bacillus subtilis and compare them with a minimal fourth-order vector-field theory for incompressible bacterial dynamics. Velocimetry of bacteria and surrounding fluid, determined by imaging cells and tracking colloidal tracers, yields consistent results for velocity statistics and correlations over two orders of magnitude in kinetic energy, revealing a decrease of fluid memory with increasing swimming activity and linear scaling between energy and enstrophy. The best-fit model parameters allow for quantitative agreement with experimental data.",Human
"The distribution of Red Blood Cells in a confined channel flow is inhomogeneous and shows a marked depletion near the walls due to a competition between migration away from the walls and shear-induced diffusion resulting from interactions between particles. We investigated the lift of RBCs in a shear flow near a wall and measured a significant lift velocity despite the tumbling motion of cells. We also provide values for the collective and anisotropic shear-induced diffusion of a cloud of RBCs, both in the direction of shear and in the direction of vorticity. A generic down-gradient subdiffusion characterized by an exponent 1/3 is highlighted.",Human
"Direct monitoring of singlet oxygen (1O2) luminescence is a particularly challenging infrared photodetection problem. 1O2, an excited state of the oxygen molecule, is a crucial intermediate in many biological processes. We employ a low noise superconducting nanowire single-photon detector to record 1O2 luminescence at 1270 nm wavelength from a model photosensitizer (Rose Bengal) in solution. Narrow band spectral filtering and chemical quenching is used to verify the 1O2 signal, and lifetime evolution with the addition of protein is studied. Furthermore, we demonstrate the detection of 1O2 luminescence through a single optical fiber, a marked advance for dose monitoring in clinical treatments such as photodynamic therapy.",Human
"Soliton rate equations are based on non-Kolmogorovian models of probability and naturally include autocatalytic processes. The formalism is not widely known but has great unexplored potential for applications to systems interacting with environments. Beginning with links of contextuality to non-Kolmogorovity we introduce the general formalism of soliton rate equations and work out explicit examples of subsystems interacting with environments. Of particular interest is the case of a soliton autocatalytic rate equation coupled to a linear conservative environment, a formal way of expressing seasonal changes. Depending on strength of the system-environment coupling we observe phenomena analogous to hibernation or even complete blocking of decay of a population.",Human
"The application of newly developed first-principle modeling techniques to liquid water deepens our understanding of the microscopic origins of its unusual macroscopic properties and behaviour. Here, we review two novel ab initio computational methods: second-generation Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics and decomposition analysis based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals. We show that these two methods in combination not only enable ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on previously inaccessible time and length scales, but also provide unprecedented insights into the nature of hydrogen bonding between water molecules. We discuss recent applications of these methods to water clusters and bulk water.",Human
"Cancer cells maintain a high level of aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), which is associated with their rapid proliferation. Many studies have reported that the suppression of glycolysis and activation of oxidative phosphorylation can repress the growth of cancer cells through regulation of key regulators. Whether Warburg effect of cancer cells could be switched by some other environmental stimulus? Herein, we report an interesting phenomenon in which cells alternated between glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration depending on the type of radiation they were exposed to. We observed enhanced glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in HeLa cells exposed to 2-Gy X-ray and 2-Gy carbon ion radiation, respectively. This discovery may provide novel insights for tumor therapy.",Human
"In this manuscript we present an in vitro model based on agarose gel that can be used to simulate a dirty, oily, bloody, and morphologically complex surface of, for example, an open wound. We show this models effectiveness in simulating depth of penetration of reactive species generated in plasma deep into tissue of a rat and confirm the penetration depths with agarose gel model. We envision that in the future such a model could be used to study plasma discharges (and other modalities) and minimize the use of live animals: plasma can be optimized on the agarose gel wound model and then finally verified using an actual wound.",Human
"Left- and right-handed helical modes' statistical absolute equilibria appear \textit{separately}. If both chiral sectors present, one can dominate around its positive pole, which is relevant to the nearly maximally helical (force free for magnetic field) states of turbulence. Pure magnetodynamics (PMD, or electron magnetohydrodynamics --- EMHD), pure hydrodynamics (PHD), and, single-fluid and two-fluid MHDs are studied. Relevant documented data and issues of cascade properties, and, helical and nonhelical dynamos are revisited. We also discuss new scenarios, such as PMD inverse magnetic helicity and forward energy cascades, and, the continuous transition from completely-inverse to partly-inverse-and-partly-forward and to completely-forward energy transfers in PHD.",Human
"We propose a new framework for the study of continuous time dynamical systems on networks. We view such dynamical systems as collections of interacting control systems. We show that a class of maps between graphs called graph fibrations give rise to maps between dynamical systems on networks. This allows us to produce conjugacy between dynamical systems out of combinatorial data. In particular we show that surjective graph fibrations lead to synchrony subspaces in networks. The injective graph fibrations, on the other hand, give rise to surjective maps from large dynamical systems to smaller ones. One can view these surjections as a kind of ""fast/slow"" variable decompositions or as ""abstractions"" in the computer science sense of the word.",Human
"An evolutionary tree is a cascade of bifurcations starting from a single common root, generating a growing set of daughter species as time goes by. Species here is a general denomination for biological species, spoken languages or any other entity evolving through heredity. From the N currently alive species within a clade, distances are measured through pairwise comparisons made by geneticists, linguists, etc. The larger is such a distance for a pair of species, the older is their last common ancestor. The aim is to reconstruct the past unknown bifurcations, i.e. the whole clade, from the knowledge of the N(N-1)/2 quoted distances taken for granted. A mechanical method is presented, and its applicability discussed.",Human
"We study colonies of non-motile, rod-shaped bacteria growing on solid substrates. In our model, bacteria interact purely mechanically, by pushing each other away as they grow, and consume a diffusing nutrient. We show that mechanical interactions control the velocity and shape of the advancing front, which leads to features that cannot be captured by established Fisher-Kolmogorov models. In particular, we find that the velocity depends on the elastic modulus of bacteria or their stickiness to the surface. Interestingly, we predict that the radius of an incompressible, strictly two-dimensional colony cannot grow linearly in time. Importantly, mechanical interactions can also account for the nonequilibrium transition between circular and branching colonies, often observed in the lab.",Human
"Confining surfaces play crucial roles in dynamics, transport and order in many physical systems, but their effects on active matter, a broad class of dynamically self-organizing systems, are poorly understood. We investigate here the influence of global confinement and surface curvature on collective motion by studying the flow and orientational order within small droplets of a dense bacterial suspension. The competition between radial confinement, self-propulsion, steric interactions and hydrodynamics robustly induces an intriguing steady single-vortex state, in which cells align in inwardly-spiralling patterns accompanied by a thin counterrotating boundary layer. A minimal continuum model is shown to be in good agreement with these observations.",Human
"Ecological networks are often composed of different sub-communities (often referred to as modules). Identifying such modules has the potential to develop a better understanding of the assembly of ecological communities and to investigate functional overlap or specialisation. The most informative form of networks are quantitative or weighted networks. Here we introduce an algorithm to identify modules in quantitative bipartite (or two-mode) networks. It is based on the hierarchical random graphs concept of Clauset et al. (2008 Nature 453: 98-101) and is extended to include quantitative information and adapted to work with bipartite graphs. We define the algorithm, which we call QuaBiMo, sketch its performance on simulated data and illustrate its potential usefulness with a case study.",Human
We have considered as a theoretical possibility for the development of a nanobiochip the operation principle of which is based on measuring conductance in single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. Calculations have demonstrated that in the majority of cases the conductance of double-stranded nucleotides considerably exceeds that of single-stranded ones. The results obtained are in agreement with recent experiments on measuring the oligonucleotide conductance. It has been shown that an electronic biochip containing 11 nucleotide pairs will recognize approximately 97% sequences. It has also been demonstrated that the percentage of identifiable sequences will grow with the sequence length.,Human
"The global dynamics of gene regulatory networks are known to show robustness to perturbations in the form of intrinsic and extrinsic noise, as well as mutations of individual genes. One molecular mechanism underlying this robustness has been identified as the action of so-called microRNAs that operate via feedforward loops. We present results of a computational study, using the modeling framework of stochastic Boolean networks, which explores the role that such network motifs play in stabilizing global dynamics. The paper introduces a new measure for the stability of stochastic networks. The results show that certain types of feedforward loops do indeed buffer the network against stochastic effects.",Human
"We, for the first time, report the detection and the size measurement of single nanoparticles (i.e. polystyrene) in aquatic environment using mode splitting in a whispering gallery mode (WGM) optical resonator, namely a microtoroid resonator. Using this method we achieved detecting and measuring individual synthetic hemozoin nanocrystals, which are a hemoglobin degradation by-product of malarial parasites, dispersed in a solution or in air. The results of size measurement in solution and in air agree with each other and with those obtained using scanning electron microscope and dynamic light scattering. Moreover, we compare the sensing capabilities of the degenerate (single resonance) and non-degenerate (split mode, doublet) operation regimes of the WGM resonator.",Human
"RNAs are negatively charged molecules residing in macromolecular crowding cellular environments. Macromolecular confinement can influence the ion effects in RNA folding. In this work, using the recently developed tightly bound ion model for ion fluctuation and correlation, we investigate the confinement effect on the ion-mediated RNA structural collapse for a simple model system. We found that, for both Na$^+$ and Mg$^{2+}$, ion efficiencies in mediating structural collapse/folding are significantly enhanced by the structural confinement. Such an enhancement in the ion efficiency is attributed to the decreased electrostatic free energy difference between the compact conformation ensemble and the (restricted) extended conformation ensemble due to the spatial restriction.",Human
"The first realization of a biomolecular OR gate function with double-sigmoid response (sigmoid in both inputs) is reported. Two chemical inputs activate the enzymatic gate processes resulting in the output signal: chromogen oxidation, which occurs when either one of the inputs or both are present (corresponding to the OR binary function), and can be optically detected. High-quality gate functioning in handling of sources of noise is enabled by ""filtering"" involving pH control with an added buffer. The resulting gate response is sigmoid in both inputs when proper system parameters are chosen, and the gate properties are theoretically analyzed within a model devised to evaluate its noise-handling properties.",Human
"During recent years, dynamical decoupling (DD) has gained relevance as a tool for manipulating quantum systems and extracting information from them. This is particularly relevant for spins involved in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), where DD sequences can be used to prolong quantum coherences, or for selectively couple/decouple the effects imposed by random environmental fluctuations. In this Letter, we show that one can exploit these concepts in order to selectively recouple diffusion processes in restricted spaces. The ensuing method provides a novel tool to measure restriction lengths in confined systems such as capillaries, pores or cells. The principles of this method for selectively recoupling diffusion-driven decoherence, its standing within the context of diffusion NMR, and corroborating experiments, are presented.",Human
"In this work we propose a model for gene expression based on the theory of random dynamical systems (RDS) and show that it has a ""modularity property"" in the following sense: given any collection of genes that are linked in a transcriptional network, if each of them is individually described by a certain class of RDS then there is a natural, and essentially unique, prescription for coupling them together, respecting the network topology, in such a way that the collective system formed by all genes is a RDS as well. Moreover, the class of RDS used to describe the individual genes is flexible enough to account for a wide range of stochastic behaviors within the realm of stationary processes.",Human
"This study reveals that, in strong coulomb coupling regime, bending a straight and fully overcharged DNA (up to its maximal acceptance by multivalent counterions) to a circle releases some of the adsorbed (correlated)counterions but still remains fully overcharged. This phenomenon seems to be inherent to the minimum energy state of a DNA. By definition, the total electrostatic potential energy of a macroion-counterion system reaches to its lowest point at maximal acceptance of overcharging counterions that ensures the most stable conformation. This intermediate phenomenon of release of cations from DNA surface due to bending can be taken into account in theoretical modeling of some ionic concentration dependent physico-chemical aspects of DNA solutions in strong Coulomb coupling regimes.",Human
"Using the Helmholtz decomposition of the vector field of folding fluxes in a two-dimensional space of collective variables, a potential of the driving force for protein folding is introduced. The potential has two components. One component is responsible for the source and sink of the folding flows, which represent, respectively, the unfolded states and the native state of the protein, and the other, which accounts for the flow vorticity inherently generated at the periphery of the flow field, is responsible for the canalization of the flow between the source and sink. The theoretical consideration is illustrated by calculations for a model $\beta$-hairpin protein.",Human
"We apply formal measures of emergence, self-organization, homeostasis, autopoiesis and complexity to an aquatic ecosystem; in particular to the physiochemical component of an Arctic lake. These measures are based on information theory. Variables with an homogeneous distribution have higher values of emergence, while variables with a more heterogeneous distribution have a higher self-organization. Variables with a high complexity reflect a balance between change (emergence) and regularity/order (self-organization). In addition, homeostasis values coincide with the variation of the winter and summer seasons. Autopoiesis values show a higher degree of independence of biological components over their environment. Our approach shows how the ecological dynamics can be described in terms of information.",Human
"We describe a simple automated method to extract and quantify transient heterogeneous dynamical changes from large datasets generated in single molecule/particle tracking experiments. Based on wavelet transform, the method transforms raw data to locally match dynamics of interest. This is accomplished using statistically adaptive universal thresholding, whose advantage is to avoid a single arbitrary threshold that might conceal individual variability across populations. How to implement this multiscale method is described, focusing on local confined diffusion separated by transient transport periods or hopping events, with 3 specific examples: in cell biology, biotechnology, and glassy colloid dynamics. This computationally-efficient method can run routinely on hundreds of millions of data points analyzed within an hour on a desktop personal computer.",Human
"We study kinetic model of Nuclear Receptor Binding to Promoter Regions. This model is written as a system of ordinary differential equations. Model reduction techniques have been used to simplify chemical kinetics.In this case study, the technique of Pseudo-first order approximation is applied to simplify the reaction rates. CellDesigner has been used to draw the structures of chemical reactions of Nuclear Receptor Binding to Promoter Regions. After model reduction, the general analytical solution for reduced model is given and the number of species and reactions are reduced from 9 species and 6 reactions to 6 species and 5 reactions.",Human
"The perceived pitch of a complex harmonic sound changes if the partials of the sound are frequency-shifted by a fixed amount. Simple mathematical rules that the perceived pitch could be expected to follow ('first pitch-shift') are violated in psychoacoustic experiments ('second pitchshift'). For this, commonly cognitive cortical processes were held responsible. Here, we show that human pitch perception can be reproduced from a minimal, purely biophysical, model of the cochlea, by fully recovering the psychoacoustical pitch-shift data of G.F. Smoorenburg (1970) and related physiological measurements from the cat cochlear nucleus. For this to happen, the cochlear fluid plays a distinguished role.",Human
"How mutations accumulate in genomes is the central question of molecular evolution theories, however our understanding of this process is far from complete. Drake's rule is a notoriously universal property of genomes from microbes to mammals - the number of (functional) mutations per-genome per-generation is approximately constant within a phylum, despite orders of magnitude differences in genome sizes and diverse populations properties. So far there is no concise explanation for this phenomenon. A formal model of storage of genetic information suggests that a genome of any species operates near its maximum informational storage capacity, and the mutation rate is near its upper limit, providing a simple explanation for the rule with minimal assumptions.",Human
"Various subsets of self-avoiding walks naturally appear when investigating existing methods designed to predict the 3D conformation of a protein of interest. Two such subsets, namely the folded and the unfoldable self-avoiding walks, are studied computationally in this article. We show that these two sets are equal and correspond to the whole $n$-step self-avoiding walks for $n\leqslant 14$, but that they are different for numerous $n \geqslant 108$, which are common protein lengths. Concrete counterexamples are provided and the computational methods used to discover them are completely detailed. A tool for studying these subsets of walks related to both pivot moves and proteins conformations is finally presented.",Human
"The entropic effects of anchored polymers on biomembranes are studied using simulations of a meshless membrane model combined with anchored linear polymer chains. The bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature are investigated for anchored ideal and excluded-volume polymer chains. Our results are in good agreement with the previous theoretical predictions. It is found that the polymer reduces the line tension of membrane edges, as well as the interfacial line tension between membrane domains, leading to microdomain formation. Instead of the mixing of two phases as observed in typical binary fluids, densely anchored polymers stabilize small domains. A mean field theory is proposed for the edge line tension reduced by anchored ideal chains, which reproduces our simulation results well.",Human
"We study the propagation of tension caused by an external force along a long polymeric molecule in two different settings, namely along a free polymer in 3d space being pulled from one end, and along a pre-stretched circular polymer, confined in a narrow circular tube. We show that in both cases, the tension propagation is governed by a diffusion equation, and in particular, the tension front propagates as $t^{1/2}$ along the contour of the chain. The results are confirmed numerically, and by molecular dynamics simulations in the case of the 3d polymer. We also compare our results with the previously suggested ones for the translocation setting, and discuss why tension propagation is slower in that case.",Human
"Motivated by DNA electrophoresis near a nanopore, we consider the flow field around an ""elongated jet"", a long thin source which injects momentum into a liquid. This solution qualitatively describes the electro-osmotic flow around a long rigid polymer, where due to electrohydrodynamic coupling, the solvent receives momentum from the electric field. Based on the qualitative behavior of the elongated jet solution, we develop a coarse-grained scheme which reproduces the known theoretical results regarding the electrophoretic behavior of a long rigid polymer and a polymer coil in a uniform field, which we then exploit to analyze the electrophoresis of a polymer coil in the non-uniform field near a nanopore.",Human
"The prevalence of long-lasting oscillatory signals in the 2d echo-spectroscopy of light-harvesting complexes has led to a search for possible mechanisms. We investigate how two causes of oscillatory signals are intertwined: (i) electronic coherences supporting delocalized wave-like motion, and (ii) narrow bands in the vibronic spectral density. To disentangle the vibronic and electronic contributions we introduce a time-windowed Fourier transform of the signal amplitude. We find that 2d spectra can be dominated by excitations of pathways which are absent in excitonic energy transport. This leads to an underestimation of the life-time of electronic coherences by 2d spectra.",Human
"Simultaneously measuring the activities of all neurons in a mammalian brain at millisecond resolution is a challenge beyond the limits of existing techniques in neuroscience. Entirely new approaches may be required, motivating an analysis of the fundamental physical constraints on the problem. We outline the physical principles governing brain activity mapping using optical, electrical,magnetic resonance, and molecular modalities of neural recording. Focusing on the mouse brain, we analyze the scalability of each method, concentrating on the limitations imposed by spatiotemporal resolution, energy dissipation, and volume displacement. We also study the physics of powering and communicating with microscale devices embedded in brain tissue.",Human
"Blood vessel constriction is simulated with particle-based method using a molecular dynamics authoring software known as Molecular Workbench (WM). Blood flow and vessel wall, the only components considered in constructing a blood vessel, are all represented in particle form with interaction potentials: Lennard-Jones potential, push-pull spring potential, and bending spring potential. Influence of medium or blood plasma is accommodated in plasma viscosity through Stokes drag force. It has been observed that pressure p is increased as constriction c is increased. Leakage of blood vessel starts at 80 % constriction, which shows existence of maximum pressure that can be overcome by vessel wall.",Human
"Polypeptides can self-assemble into hierarchically organized fibrils consisting of a stack of individually folded polypeptides driven together by hydrophobic interaction. Using a coarse grained model, we systematically studied this self-assembly as a function of temperature and hydrophobicity of the residues on the outside of the building block. We find the self-assembly can occur via two different pathways - a random aggregation-folding route, and a templated-folding process - thus indicating a strong coupling between folding and assembly. The simulation results can explain experimental evidence that assembly through stacking of folded building blocks is rarely observed, at the experimental concentrations. The model thus provides a generic picture of hierarchical fibril formation.",Human
"We report SInC (SNV, Indel and CNV) simulator and read generator, an open-source tool capable of simulating biological variants taking into account a platform-specific error model. SInC is capable of simulating and generating single- and paired-end reads with user-defined insert size with high efficiency compared to the other existing tools. SInC, due to its multi-threaded capability during read generation, has a low time footprint. SInC is currently optimised to work in limited infrastructure setup and can efficiently exploit the commonly used quad-core desktop architecture to simulate short sequence reads with deep coverage for large genomes. Sinc can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/sincsimulator/.",Human
"The motion of a rotating helical body in a viscoelastic fluid is considered. In the case of force-free swimming, the introduction of viscoelasticity can either enhance or retard the swimming speed and locomotive efficiency, depending on the body geometry, fluid properties, and the body rotation rate. Numerical solutions of the Oldroyd-B equations show how previous theoretical predictions break down with increasing helical radius or with decreasing filament thickness. Helices of large pitch angle show an increase in swimming speed to a local maximum at a Deborah number of order unity. The numerical results show how the small-amplitude theoretical calculations connect smoothly to the large-amplitude experimental measurements.",Human
"To function as gene regulatory elements in response to environmental signals, riboswitches must adopt specific secondary structures on appropriate time scales. We employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulation to model the time-dependent folding during transcription of TPP riboswitch expression platforms. According to our simulations, riboswitch transcriptional terminators, which must adopt a specific hairpin configuration by the time they have been transcribed, fold with higher efficiency than Shine-Dalgarno sequesterers, whose proper structure is required only at the time of ribosomal binding. Our findings suggest both that riboswitch transcriptional terminator sequences have been naturally selected for high folding efficiency, and that sequesterers can maintain their function even in the presence of significant misfolding.",Human
"A model of telomere dynamics is proposed and examined. Our model, which extends a previously introduced two-compartment model that incorporates stem cells as progenitors of new cells, imposes the Hayflick Limit, the maximum number of cell divisions that are possible. This new model leads to cell populations for which the average telomere length is not necessarily a monotonically decreasing function of time, in contrast to previously published models. We provide a phase diagram indicating where such results would be expected. In addition, qualitatively different results are obtained for the evolution of the total cell population. Last, in comparison to available leukocyte baboon data, this new model is shown to provide a better fit to biological data.",Human
"We study the mean field approximation to a simple spatial host-pathogen model that has been shown to display interesting evolutionary properties. We show that previous derivations of the mean field equations for this model are actually only low-density approximations to the true mean field limit. We derive the correct equations and the corresponding equations including pair-correlations. The process of invasion by a mutant type of pathogen is also discussed. [This article was published as Physical Review E 67, 047102 (2003). Errata for the published version are corrected here and explicitly listed at the end of this document.]",Human
"In previous works, the author and collaborators establish a mathematical model for injury response in articular cartilage. In this paper we use mathematical software and computational techniques, applied to an existing model to explore in more detail how the behavior of cartilage cells is influenced by several of, what are believed to be, the most significant mechanisms underlying cartilage injury response at the cellular level. We introduce a control parameter, the radius of attenuation, and present some new simulations that shed light on how inflammation associated with cartilage injuries impacts the metabolic activity of cartilage cells. The details presented in the work can help to elucidate targets for more effective therapies in the preventative treatment of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.",Human
"Recent chromosome conformation capture experiments have led to the discovery of dense, contiguous, megabase-sized topological domains that are similar across cell types and conserved across species. These domains are strongly correlated with a number of chromatin markers and have since been included in a number of analyses. However, functionally-relevant domains may exist at multiple length scales. We introduce a new and efficient algorithm that is able to capture persistent domains across various resolutions by adjusting a single scale parameter. The identified novel domains are substantially different from domains reported previously and are highly enriched for insulating factor CTCF binding and histone modfications at the boundaries.",Human
"We study a stochastic spatial model of biological competition in which two species have the same birth and death rates, but different diffusion constants. In the absence of this difference, the model can be considered as an off-lattice version of the Voter model and presents similar coarsening properties. We show that even a relative difference in diffusivity on the order of a few percent may lead to a strong bias in the coarsening process favoring the more agile species. We theoretically quantify this selective advantage and present analytical formulas for the average growth of the fastest species and its fixation probability.",Human
"We study the average asymptotic growth rate of cells in randomly fluctuating environments, with multiple viable phenotypes per environment. We show that any information processing strategy has an asymptotic growth rate, which is the sum of: (i) the maximal growth rate at the worst possible distribution of environments, (ii) relative information between the actual distribution of environments to the worst one, and (iii) information utilization rate, which is the information rate of the sensory devices minus the ""information dissipation rate"", the amount of information not utilized by the cell for growth. In non-stationary environments, we find that the optimal phenotypic switching times equally partition the information dissipation rate between consecutive switching intervals.",Human
"Social animals have to make collective decisions on a daily basis. In most instances, these decisions are taken by consensus, when the group does what the majority of individuals want. Individuals have to base these decisions on the information they perceive from their socioecological landscape. The perception mechanisms they use can influence the cost of collective decisions. Here I show that when group-living individuals perceive their environment concurrently for the same decisions, a quantum-like perception entanglement process can confer less costly collective decisions than when individuals collect their information independently. This highlights a mechanism that can help explain what may seem to be irrational group-living behavior and opens avenues to develop empirical tests for quantum decision theory.",Human
"We study dynamics of a two-level system coupled simultaneously to a pair of dissimilar reservoirs, namely, a spin bath and a boson bath, which are connected via finite interbath coupling. It is found that the steady-state energy transfer in the two-level system increases with its coupling to the spin bath while optimal transfer occurs at intermediate coupling in the transient process. If the two-level system is strongly coupled to the spin bath, the population transfer is unidirectional barring minor population oscillations of minute amplitudes. If the spin bath is viewed as an atomic ensemble, robust generation of macroscopic superposition states exists against parameter variations of the two-level system and the boson bath.",Human
"Regular vegetation patterns in semiarid ecosystems are believed to arise from the interplay between long-range competition and facilitation processes acting at smaller distances. We show that, under rather general conditions, long-range competition alone may be enough to shape these patterns. To this end we propose a simple, general model for the dynamics of vegetation, which includes only long-range competition between plants. Competition is introduced through a nonlocal term, where the kernel function quantifies the intensity of the interaction. We recover the full spectrum of spatial structures typical of vegetation models that also account for facilitation in addition to competition.",Human
"Energy is a complex idea that cuts across scientific disciplines. For life science students, an approach to energy that incorporates chemical bonds and chemical reactions is better equipped to meet the needs of life sciences students than a traditional introductory physics approach that focuses primarily on mechanical energy. We present a curricular sequence, or thread, designed to build up students' understanding of chemical energy in an introductory physics course for the life sciences. This thread is designed to connect ideas about energy from physics, biology, and chemistry. We describe the kinds of connections among energetic concepts that we intended to develop to build interdisciplinary coherence, and present some examples of curriculum materials and student data that illustrate our approach.",Human
"To simulate long time and length scale processes involving DNA it is necessary to use a coarse-grained description. Here we provide an overview of different approaches to such coarse graining, focussing on those at the nucleotide level that allow the self-assembly processes associated with DNA nanotechnology to be studied. OxDNA, our recently-developed coarse-grained DNA model, is particularly suited to this task, and has opened up this field to systematic study by simulations. We illustrate some of the range of DNA nanotechnology systems to which the model is being applied, as well as the insights it can provide into fundamental biophysical properties of DNA.",Human
"We present an experimentally guided, bi-phasic, multi-species ionic gel model to compare and make quantitative predictions on the viscoelastic properties of healthy mucus versus Cystic-Fibrosis infected mucus. The mixture theory consists of the mucus (polymer phase) and water (solvent phase) as well as several different ions: H$^+$, Na$^+$, Cl$^-$ and Ca$^{2+}$. The model is calibrated with the experimental data of mucus diffusivities. Numerical studies reveal that the Donnan forces are the dominating mechanism driving the mucus swelling/deswelling transition. However, these transitions could be continuous or discontinuous, depending on the complex interplay between ionic bath concentrations, pH, polymer mass in the solvent and the average charge per monomer.",Human
"The transmission dynamics of some infectious diseases is related to the contact structure between individuals in a network. We used five algorithms to generate contact networks with different topological structure but with the same scale-free degree distribution. We simulated the spread of acute and chronic infectious diseases on these networks, using SI (Susceptible - Infected) and SIS (Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible) epidemic models. In the simulations, our objective was to observe the effects of the topological structure of the networks on the dynamics and prevalence of the simulated diseases. We found that the dynamics of spread of an infectious disease on different networks with the same degree distribution may be considerably different.",Human
"The quantal release of catecholamines from neuroendocrine cells is a key mechanism which has been investigated with a broad range of materials and devices, among which carbon-based materials such as carbon fibers, diamond-like carbon, carbon nanotubes and nanocrystalline diamond. In the present work we demonstrate that a MeV-ion-microbeam lithographic technique can be successfully employed for the fabrication of an all-carbon miniaturized cellular bio-sensor based on graphitic micro-channels embedded in a single-crystal diamond matrix. The device was functionally characterized for the in vitro recording of quantal exocytic events from single chromaffin cells, with high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, opening promising perspectives for the realization of monolithic all-carbon cellular biosensors.",Human
"The structural and dynamical properties of suspensions of self-propelled Brownian particles of spherical shape are investigated in three spatial dimensions. Our simulations reveal a phase separation into a dilute and a dense phase, above a certain density and strength of self-propulsion. The packing fraction of the dense phase approaches random close packing at high activity, yet the system remains fluid. Although no alignment mechanism exists in this model, we find long-lived cooperative motion of the particles in the dense regime. This behavior is probably due to an interface-induced sorting process. Spatial displacement correlation functions are nearly scale-free for systems with densities close to or above the glass transition density of passive systems.",Human
"It has long been accepted that the multiple-ion single-file transport model is appropriate for many kinds of ion channels. However, most of the purely theoretical works in this field did not capture all of the important features of the realistic systems. Nowadays, large-scale atomic-level simulations are more feasible. Discrepancy between theories, simulations and experiments are getting obvious, enabling people to carefully examine the missing parts of the theoretical models and methods. In this work, it is attempted to find out the essential features that such kind of models should possess, in order that the physical properties of an ion channel be adequately reflected.",Human
"A new type of metabolizable and efficient radiosensitizer for cancer radiotherapy is presented in this study by combining ultrasmall Au nanoclusters (NCs, <2 nm) with biocompatible coating ligands (glutathione, GSH). The new nano-construct (GSH-coated Au25 NCs) inherits attractive features of both the Au core (strong radiosensitizing effect) and GSH shell (good biocompatibility). It can preferentially accumulate in tumor via the improved EPR effect, which leads to strong enhancement for cancer radiotherapy. After the treatment, the small-sized GSH-Au25 NCs can be efficiently cleared by the kidney, minimizing any potential side effects due to the accumulation of Au25 NCs in the body.",Human
"In bacteria, regulatory proteins search for a specific DNA binding target via ""facilitated diffusion"": a series of rounds of 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm, and 1D linear diffusion along the DNA contour. Using large scale Brownian dynamics simulations we find that each of these steps is affected differently by crowding proteins, which can either be bound to the DNA acting as a road block to the 1D diffusion, or freely diffusing in the cytoplasm. Macromolecular crowding can strongly affect mechanistic features such as the balance between 3D and 1D diffusion, but leads to surprising robustness of the total search time.",Human
"We analyse the effect of the Basset history force on the sedimentation or rising of inertial particles in a two-dimensional convection flow. When memory effects are neglected, the system exhibits rich dynamics, including periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic attractors. Here we show that when the full advection dynamics is considered, including the history force, both the nature and the number of attractors change, and a fractalization of their basins of attraction appears. In particular, we show that the history force significantly weakens the horizontal diffusion and changes the speed of sedimentation or rising. The influence of the history force is dependent on the size of the advected particles, being stronger for larger particles.",Human
"We consider a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model with a contact rate that fluctuates seasonally. Through the use of a nonlinear, stochastic projection, we are able to analytically determine the lower dimensional manifold on which the deterministic and stochastic dynamics correctly interact. Our method produces a low dimensional stochastic model that captures the same timing of disease outbreak and the same amplitude and phase of recurrent behavior seen in the high dimensional model. Given seasonal epidemic data consisting of the number of infectious individuals, our method enables a data-based model prediction of the number of unobserved exposed individuals over very long times.",Human
"Cluster analysis faces two problems in high dimensions: first, the `curse of dimensionality' that can lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance; and second, the sheer time taken for conventional algorithms to process large amounts of high-dimensional data. In many applications, only a small subset of features provide information about the cluster membership of any one data point, however this informative feature subset may not be the same for all data points. Here we introduce a `Masked EM' algorithm for fitting mixture of Gaussians models in such cases. We show that the algorithm performs close to optimally on simulated Gaussian data, and in an application of `spike sorting' of high channel-count neuronal recordings.",Human
"The message passing approach of Karrer and Newman [Phys. Rev. E 82, 016101 (2010)] is an exact and practicable representation of susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics on finite trees. Here we show that, assuming Poisson contact processes, a pair-based moment closure representation [Sharkey, J. Math. Biol. 57, 311 (2008)] can be derived from their equations. We extend the applicability of both representations and discuss their relative merits. On arbitrary time-independent networks, as was shown for the message passing formalism, the pair-based moment closure equations also provide a rigorous lower bound on the expected number of susceptibles at all times.",Human
"Several variations of the Watterson estimator of variability for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data have been proposed in the literature. We present a unified framework for generalized Watterson estimators based on Maximum Composite Likelihood, which encompasses most of the existing estimators. We propose this class of unbiased estimators as generalized Watterson estimators for a large class of NGS data, including pools and trios. We also discuss the relation with the estimators that have been proposed in the literature and show that they admit two equivalent but seemingly different forms, deriving a set of combinatorial identities as a byproduct. Finally, we give a detailed treatment of Watterson estimators for single or multiple autopolyploid individuals.",Human
"Nanodiamonds (NDs) containing silicon vacancy (SiV) defects were evaluated as a potential biomarker for the labeling and fluorescent imaging of neural precursor cells (NPCs). SiV-containing NDs were synthesized using chemical vapor deposition and silicon ion implantation. Spectrally, SiV-containing NDs exhibited extremely stable fluorescence and narrow bandwidth emission with an excellent signal to noise ratio exceeding that of NDs containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. NPCs labeled with NDs exhibited normal cell viability and proliferative properties consistent with biocompatibility. We conclude that SiVcontaining NDs are a promising biomedical research tool for cellular labeling and optical imaging in stem cell research.",Human
"A quantum-based magnetic compass sensor, mediated through radical pair reactions, has been suggested to underlie the sensory ability of migrating birds to receive directional information from the geomagnetic field. Here we extend the currently available models by considering the effects of slow fluctuations in the nuclear spin environment on the directional signal. We quantitatively evaluate the robustness of signals under fluctuations on a timescale longer than the lifetime of a radical pair, utilizing two models of radical pairs. Our results suggest design principles for building a radical-pair based compass sensor that is both robust and highly directional sensitive.",Human
"We study the effects of the shear force on the rupture mechanism on a double stranded DNA. Motivated by recent experiments, we perform the atomistic simulations with explicit solvent to obtain the distributions of extension in hydrogen and covalent bonds below the rupture force. We obtain a significant difference between the atomistic simulations and the existing results in the iterature based on the coarse-grained models (theory and simulations). We discuss the possible reasons and improve the coarse-grained model by incorporating the consequences of semi-microscopic details of the nucleotides in its description. The distributions obtained by the modified model (simulations and theoretical) are qualitatively similar to the one obtained using atomistic simulations.",Human
"In the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model of disease spreading, the time to extinction of the epidemics happens at an intermediate value of the per-contact transmission probability. Too contagious infections burn out fast in the population. Infections that are not contagious enough die out before they spread to a large fraction of people. We characterize how the maximal extinction time in SIR simulations on networks depend on the network structure. For example we find that the average distances in isolated components, weighted by the component size, is a good predictor of the maximal time to extinction. Furthermore, the transmission probability giving the longest outbreaks is larger than, but otherwise seemingly independent of, the epidemic threshold.",Human
"Most animals possess the ability to actuate a vast diversity of movements, ostensibly constrained only by morphology and physics. In practice, however, a frequent assumption in behavioral science is that most of an animal's activities can be described in terms of a small set of stereotyped motifs. Here we introduce a method for mapping the behavioral space of organisms, relying only upon the underlying structure of postural movement data to organize and classify behaviors. We find that six different drosophilid species each perform a mix of non-stereotyped actions and over one hundred hierarchically-organized, stereotyped behaviors. Moreover, we use this approach to compare these species' behavioral spaces, systematically identifying subtle behavioral differences between closely-related species.",Human
"The influence of migration on the stochastic dynamics of subdivided populations is still an open issue in various evolutionary models. We develop here a self-consistent mean-field-like method in order to determine the effects of migration on relevant nonequilibrium properties, such as the mean fixation time. If evolution strongly favors coexistence of species (e.g., balancing selection), the mean fixation time develops an unexpected minimum as a function of the migration rate. Our analysis hinges only on the presence of a separation of time scales between local and global dynamics and therefore it carries over to other nonequilibrium processes in physics, biology, ecology, and social sciences.",Human
"The theoretical and experimental study of energy transfer in photosynthesis has revealed an interesting transport regime, which lies at the borderline between classical transport dynamics and quantum-mechanical interference effects. Dissipation is caused by the coupling of electronic degrees of freedom to vibrational modes and leads to a directional energy transfer from the antenna complex to the target reaction-center. The dissipative driving is robust and does not rely on fine-tuning of specific vibrational modes. For the parameter regime encountered in the biological systems new theoretical tools are required to directly compare theoretical results with experimental spectroscopy data. The calculations require to utilize massively parallel graphics processor units (GPUs) for efficient and exact computations.",Human
"We investigate the potential of numerical algorithms to decipher the kinetic parameters involved in multi-step chemical reactions. To this end we study a dimerization kinetics of protein as a model system. We follow the dimerization kinetics using a stochastic simulation algorithm and combine it with three different optimization techniques (Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and Parallel Tempering) to obtain the rate constants involved in each reaction step. We find good convergence of the numerical scheme to the rate constants of the process. We also perform a sensitivity test on the reaction kinetic parameters to see the relative effects of the parameters for the associated profile of the monomer/dimer distribution.",Human
"Relevance of mode coupling to energy/information transfer during protein function, particularly in the context of allosteric interactions is widely accepted. However, existing evidence in favor of this hypothesis comes essentially from model systems. We here report a novel formal analysis of the near-native dynamics of myosin II, which allows us to explore the impact of the interaction between possibly non-Gaussian vibrational modes on fluctutational dynamics. We show that, an information-theoretic measure based on mode coupling {\it alone} yields a ranking of residues with a statistically significant bias favoring the functionally critical locations identified by experiments on myosin II.",Human
"We propose a new look at the heat bath for two Brownian particles, in which the heat bath as a `system' is both perturbed and sensed by the Brownian particles. Non-local thermal fluctuation give rise to bath-mediated static forces between the particles. Based on the general sum-rule of the linear response theory, we derive an explicit relation linking these forces to the friction kernel describing the particles' dynamics. The relation is analytically confirmed in the case of two solvable models and could be experimentally challenged. Our results point out that the inclusion of the environment as a part of the whole system is important for micron- or nano-scale physics.",Human
"We introduce a parallel algorithmic architecture for metagenomic sequence assembly, termed MetaPar, which allows for significant reductions in assembly time and consequently enables the processing of large genomic datasets on computers with low memory usage. The gist of the approach is to iteratively perform read (re)classification based on phylogenetic marker genes and assembler outputs generated from random subsets of metagenomic reads. Once a sufficiently accurate classification within genera is performed, de novo metagenomic assemblers (such as Velvet or IDBA-UD) or reference based assemblers may be used for contig construction. We analyze the performance of MetaPar on synthetic data consisting of 15 randomly chosen species from the NCBI database through the effective gap and effective coverage metrics.",Human
"The model analyzes the muscle fiber as a deformable system for which experimental data are determinated with the help of the laws of Newtonian mechanic. The model predicts the four transient phases for the shortening of a muscle fiber according to a force or length step. The model shows, on the one hand, the importance of the viscosity during the first phase of these two types of step and, secondly, the interdependence of the six other phases towards a bimodal state after disappearance of actions due to viscosity. The model provides an interpretation for the behavior of a fiber with shortening staircase. The model is consistent with experimental data during temperature changes or various structural alterations.",Human
"We assess electrical brain dynamics before, during, and after one-hundred human epileptic seizures with different anatomical onset locations by statistical and spectral properties of functionally defined networks. We observe a concave-like temporal evolution of characteristic path length and cluster coefficient indicative of a movement from a more random toward a more regular and then back toward a more random functional topology. Surprisingly, synchronizability was significantly decreased during the seizure state but increased already prior to seizure end. Our findings underline the high relevance of studying complex systems from the view point of complex networks, which may help to gain deeper insights into the complicated dynamics underlying epileptic seizures.",Human
"The emergence of agriculture is suggested to have driven extensive human population growths. However, genetic evidence from maternal mitochondrial genomes suggests major population expansions began before the emergence of agriculture. Therefore, role of agriculture that played in initial population expansions still remains controversial. Here, we analyzed a set of globally distributed whole Y chromosome and mitochondrial genomes of 526 male samples from 1000 Genome Project. We found that most major paternal lineage expansions coalesced in Neolithic Time. The estimated effective population sizes through time revealed strong evidence for 10- to 100-fold increase in population growth of males with the advent of agriculture. This sex-biased Neolithic expansion might result from the reduction in hunting-related mortality of males.",Human
"We employ the adaptive resolution approach AdResS, in its recently developed Grand Canonical-like version (GC-AdResS) [Wang et al. Phys.Rev.X 3, 011018 (2013)], to calculate the excess chemical potential, $\mu^{ex}$, of various liquids and mixtures. We compare our results with those obtained from full atomistic simulations using the technique of thermodynamic integration and show a satisfactory agreement. In GC-AdResS the procedure to calculate $\mu^{ex}$ corresponds to the process of standard initial equilibration of the system; this implies that, independently of the specific aim of the study, $\mu^{ex}$, for each molecular species, is automatically calculated every time a GC-AdResS simulation is performed.",Human
"The mechanism allowing a protein to search of a target sequence on DNA is currently described as an intermittent process composed of 3D diffusion in bulk and 1D diffusion along the DNA molecule. Due to the relevant charge of protein and DNA, electrostatic interaction should play a crucial role during this search. In this paper, we explicitly derive the mean field theory allowing for a description of the protein-DNA electrostatics in solution. This approach leads to a unified model of the search process, where 1D and 3D diffusion appear as a natural consequence of the diffusion on an extended interaction energy profile.",Human
"X-ray data indicate that complexes of ribosomes with cognate and near cognate tRNAs are very similar structurally, and this was the ground for a suggestion that the ribosome discriminates correct codon-anticodon pair because of its higher stability. Here an alternative explanation of kinetic proofreading is suggested, and intramolecular oscillations in tRNAs play a keystone role in it. Resonance of the oscillations allows the cognate codon-anticodon pair to be conserved due to fast energy transfer to other part of the tRNA molecule. This mechanism can potentially discriminate correct pair from an incorrect one even if they have similar stabilities.",Human
"In the study of the evolution of cooperation, resource limitations are usually assumed just to provide a finite population size. Recently, however, it has been pointed out that resource limitation may also generate dynamical payoffs able to modify the original structure of the games. Here we study analytically a phase transition from a homogeneous population of defectors when resources are abundant to the survival of unconditional cooperators when resources reduce below a threshold. To this end, we introduce a model of simple agents, with no memory or ability of recognition, interacting in well-mixed populations. The result might shed light on the role played by resource constraints on the origin of multicellularity.",Human
Viruses are biological nanosystems with a capsid of protein-made capsomer units that encloses and protects the genetic material responsible for their replication. Here we show how the geometrical constraints of the capsomer-capsomer interaction in icosahedral capsids fix the form of the shortest and universal truncated multipolar expansion of the two-body interaction between capsomers. The structures of many of the icosahedral and related virus capsids are located as single lowest energy states of this potential energy surface. Our approach unveils relevant features of the natural design of the capsids and can be of interest in fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology where similar hollow convex structures are relevant.,Human
"The aim of this paper is to study the (clinical) time-series data of three diseases with complex dynamics: Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. For this purpose, first all of the time series data are embedded in a vector space of suitable dimension and then the correlation dimension of the above mentioned diseases is estimated. The results are also compared with healthy control subjects. At the next step, existence of chaos in these diseases is investigated by means of the so-called 0-1 test. The simulations show that none of the above mentioned diseases are chaotic.",Human
"We introduce a system of pulse coupled oscillators that can change both their phases and frequencies; and prove that when there is a separation of time scales between phase and frequency adjustment the system converges to exact synchrony on strongly connected graphs with time delays. The analysis involves decomposing the network into a forest of tree-like structures that capture causality. Furthermore, we provide a lower bound for the size of the basin of attraction with immediate implications for empirical networks and random graph models. These results provide a robust method of sensor net synchronization as well as demonstrate a new avenue of possible pulse coupled oscillator research.",Human
"Complex networks are intrinsically modular. Resolving small modules is particularly difficult when the network is densely connected; wide variation of link weights invites additional complexities. In this article we present an algorithm to detect community structure in densely connected weighted networks. First, modularity of the network is calculated by erasing the links having weights smaller than a cutoff $q.$ Then one takes all the disjoint components obtained at $q=q_c,$ where the modularity is maximum, and modularize the components individually using Newman Girvan's algorithm for weighted networks. We show, taking microRNA (miRNA) co-target network of Homo sapiens as an example, that this algorithm could reveal miRNA modules which are known to be relevant in biological context.",Human
"Direct-Coupling Analysis is a group of methods to harvest information about coevolving residues in a protein family by learning a generative model in an exponential family from data. In protein families of realistic size, this learning can only be done approximately, and there is a trade-off between inference precision and computational speed. We here show that an earlier introduced $l_2$-regularized pseudolikelihood maximization method called plmDCA can be modified as to be easily parallelizable, as well as inherently faster on a single processor, at negligible difference in accuracy. We test the new incarnation of the method on 148 protein families from the Protein Families database (PFAM), one of the largest tests of this class of algorithms to date.",Human
"Water molecules play an important role in providing unique environments for biological reactions on cell membranes. It is widely believed that water molecules form bridges that connect lipid molecules and stabilize cell membranes. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show that translational and rotational diffusion of water molecules on lipid membrane surfaces exhibit subdiffusion. Moreover, we provide evidence that both divergent mean trapping time (continuous-time random walk) and long-correlated noise (fractional Brownian motion) contribute to this subdiffusion. These results suggest that subdiffusion on cell membranes causes the water retardation, an enhancement of cell membrane stability, and a higher reaction efficiency.",Human
"The minimal ecological requirements for formation of regular vegetation patterns in semiarid systems have been recently questioned. Against the general belief that a combination of facilitative and competitive interactions is necessary, recent theoretical studies suggest that, under broad conditions, nonlocal competition among plants alone may induce patterns. In this paper, we review results along this line, presenting a series of models that yield spatial patterns when finite-range competition is the only driving force. A preliminary derivation of this type of model from a more detailed one that considers water-biomass dynamics is also presented. Keywords: Vegetation patterns, nonlocal interactions",Human
"We present a Landau type theory for the non-linear elasticity of biopolymer gels with a part of the order parameter describing induced nematic order of fibers in the gel. We attribute the non-linear elastic behavior of these materials to fiber alignment induced by strain. We suggest an application to contact guidance of cell motility in tissue. We compare our theory to simulation of a disordered lattice model for biopolymers. We treat homogeneous deformations such as simple shear, hydrostatic expansion, and simple extension, and obtain good agreement between theory and simulation. We also consider a localized perturbation which is a simple model for a contracting cell in a medium.",Human
"Constitutive equations for a one-dimensional, active, polar, viscoelastic liquid are derived by treating the strain field as a slow hydrodynamic variable. Taking into account the couplings between strain and polarity allowed by symmetry, the hydrodynamics of an active, polar, viscoelastic body include an evolution equation for the polarity field that generalizes the damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Beyond thresholds of the active coupling coefficients between the polarity and the stress or the strain rate, bifurcations of the homogeneous state lead first to stationary waves, then to propagating waves of the strain, stress and polarity fields. I argue that these results are relevant to living matter, and may explain rotating actomyosin rings in cells and mechanical waves in epithelial cell monolayers.",Human
"We apply here the principle of affine symmetry to the nested fullerene cages (carbon onions) that arise in the context of carbon chemistry. Previous work on affine extensions of the icosahedral group has revealed a new organisational principle in virus structure and assembly. We adapt this group theoretic framework here to the physical requirements dictated by carbon chemistry, and show that we can derive mathematical models for carbon onions within this affine symmetry approach. This suggests the applicability of affine symmetry in a wider context in Nature, as well as offering a novel perspective on the geometric principles underpinning carbon chemistry.",Human
"The uniform sampling of convex regions in high dimension is an important computational issue, from both theoretical and applied point of view. The hit-and-run montecarlo algorithms are the most efficient methods known to perform it and one of their bottlenecks relies in the difficulty of escaping from tight corners in high dimension. Inspired by optimized montecarlo methods used in statistical mechanics we define a new algorithm by overelaxing the hit-and-run dynamics. We made numerical simulations on high dimensional simplices in order to test its performances, pointing out its improved ability to escape from angles and finally apply it to an inference problem in the steady state dynamics of metabolic networks.",Human
"Interactive molecular graphics applications facilitate analysis of three dimensional protein structures. Naturally, non-interactive 2-D snapshots of the protein structures do not convey the same level of geometric detail. Several 2-D visualization methods have been in use to summarize structural information, including contact maps and 2-D cartoon views. We present a new approach for 2-D visualization of protein structures where amino acid residues are displayed on a circle and spatially close residues are depicted by links. Furthermore, residue-specific properties, such as conservation, accessibility, temperature factor, can be displayed as plots on the same circular view.",Human
"The way for performing multiple sequence alignment is based on the criterion of the maximum scored information content computed from a weight matrix, but it is possible to have two or more alignments to have the same highest score leading to ambiguities in selecting the best alignment. This paper addresses this issue by introducing the concept of joint weight matrix to eliminate the randomness in selecting the best multiple sequence alignment. Alignments with equal scores are iteratively rescored with the joint weight matrix of increasing level (nucleotide pairs, triplets and so on) until one single best alignment is eventually found. This method for resolving ambiguity in multiple sequence alignment can be easily implemented by use of the improved scoring matrix.",Human
"A statistical study of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) is presented based on the estimation of similar-word set distribution. It is observed that CRMs tend to have a fat-tail distribution. A new statistical fat-tail test with two kurtosis-based fatness coefficients is proposed to distinguish CRMs from non-CRMs. As compared with the existing fluffy-tail test, the first fatness coefficient is designed to reduce computational time, making the novel fat-tail test very suitable for long sequences and large database analysis in the post-genome time and the second one to improve separation accuracy between CRMs and non-CRMs. These two fatness coefficients may be served as valuable filtering indexes to predict CRMs experimentally.",Human
"Single and collective cellular oscillations involving the actomyosin cytoskeleton have been observed in numerous biological systems. We show here that a generic model of a contractile material, which is turning over and contracts against an elastic element, exhibits spontaneous oscillations. Such a model can thus account for shape oscillations observed in amnioserosa cells during dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo. We investigate the collective dynamics of an ensemble of such oscillators and show that the relative contribution of viscous and friction losses yield different regimes of collective oscillations. Taking into account the diffusion of contractile elements, our theoretical framework predicts the appearance of traveling waves which might account for the propagation of actomyosin contractile waves observed during morphogenesis.",Human
"This work asks how light harvesting in photosynthetic systems can be optimised for economically scalable, sustainable energy production. Hierarchy theory is introduced as a system-analysis and optimisation tool better able to handle multiscale, multiprocess complexities in photosynthetic energetics compared with standard linear-process analysis. Within this framework, new insights are given into relationships between composition, structure and energetics at the scale of the thylakoid membrane, and also into how components at different scales cooperate under functional objectives of the whole photosynthetic system. Combining these reductionistic and holistic analyses creates a platform for modelling multiscale-optimal, idealised photosynthetic systems in silico.",Human
"Guided by extensive numerical simulations, we propose a microfluidic device that can sort elastic capsules by their deformability. The device consists of a duct embedded with a semi-cylindrical obstacle, and a diffuser which further enhances the sorting capability. We demonstrate that the device can operate reasonably well under changes in the initial position of the the capsule. The efficiency of the device remains essentially unaltered under small changes of the obstacle shape (from semi-circular to semi-elliptic cross-section). Confinement along the direction perpendicular to the plane of the device increases its efficiency. This work is the first numerical study of cell sorting by a realistic microfluidic device.",Human
"Atomistic simulations were performed on hydrated model lipid multilayers that are representative of the lipid matrix in the outer skin (stratum corneum). We find that cholesterol transfers easily between adjacent leaflets belonging to the same bilayer via fast orientational diffusion (tumbling) in the inter-leaflet disordered region, while at the same time there is a large free energy cost against swelling. This fast flip-flop may play an important role in accommodating the variety of curvatures that would be required in the three dimensional arrangement of the lipid multilayers in skin, and for enabling mechanical or hydration induced strains without large curvature elastic costs.",Human
"Network measures that reflect the most salient properties of complex large-scale networks are in high demand in the network research community. In this paper we adapt a combinatorial measure of negative curvature (also called hyperbolicity) to parameterized finite networks, and show that a variety of biological and social networks are hyperbolic. This hyperbolicity property has strong implications on the higher-order connectivity and other topological properties of these networks. Specifically, we derive and prove bounds on the distance among shortest or approximately shortest paths in hyperbolic networks. We describe two implications of these bounds to cross-talk in biological networks, and to the existence of central, influential neighborhoods in both biological and social networks.",Human
"In this paper, we propose a dynamic delayed feedback control approach for desynchronization of chaotic-bursting synchronous activities in an ensemble of globally coupled neuronal oscillators. We demonstrate that the difference signal between an ensemble's mean field and its time delayed state, filtered and fed back to the ensemble, can suppress the self-synchronization in the ensemble. These individual units are decoupled and stabilized at the desired desynchronized states while the stimulation signal reduces to the noise level. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by examples of two different populations of globally coupled chaotic-bursting neurons. The proposed method has potential for mild, effective and demand-controlled therapy of neurological diseases characterized by pathological synchronization.",Human
"We describe the effect of optical aberrations on fluorescence fluctuations microscopy (FFM), when focusing through a single living cell. FFM measurements are performed in an aqueous fluorescent solution and prove to be a highly sensitive tool to assess the optical aberrations introduced by the cell. We demonstrate an adaptive optics (AO) system to remove the aberration-related bias in the FFM measurements. Our data show that AO is not only useful when imaging deep in tissues but also when performing FFM measurements through a single cellular layer. This work paves the way for the application of FFM to complex three-dimensional multicellular samples.",Human
"We analyze fluctuations of particle displacements and stresses in a sheared athermal suspension of elastic capsules (red blood cells). Upon variation of the volume fraction from the dilute up to the highly concentrated regime, our numerical simulations reveal different characteristic power-law regimes of the fluctuation variances and relaxation times. In the jammed phase and at high shear rates, anomalous scaling exponents are found that deviate from pure dimensional predictions. The observed behavior is rationalized via kinetic arguments and a dissipation balance model that takes into account the local fluid flows between the particles. Our findings support the view that the rheology of dense suspensions is essentially governed by the non-affine displacements.",Human
"Here we report on the use of double-nanohole (DNH) optical tweezers as a label-free and free-solution single-molecule probe for protein-DNA interactions. Using this approach, we demonstrate the unzipping of individual 10 base pair DNA-hairpins, and quantify how tumor suppressor p53 protein delays the unzipping. From the Arrhenius behavior, we find the energy barrier to unzipping introduced by p53 to be $2\times 10^{-20}$ J, whereas cys135ser mutant p53 does not show suppression of unzipping, which gives clues to its functional inability to suppress tumor growth. This transformative approach to single molecule analysis allows for ultra-sensitive detection and quantification of protein-DNA interactions to revolutionize the fight against genetic diseases.",Human
"Transitions in the qualitative behavior of chemical reaction dynamics with a decrease in molecule number have attracted much attention. Here, a method based on a Markov process with a tridiagonal transition matrix is applied to the analysis of this transition in reaction dynamics. The transition to bistability due to the small-number effect and the mean switching time between the bistable states are analytically calculated in agreement with numerical simulations. In addition, a novel transition involving the reversal of the chemical reaction flow is found in the model under an external flow, and also in a three-component model. The generality of this transition and its correspondence to biological phenomena are also discussed.",Human
"A wide range of networked systems exhibit highly connected nodes (hubs) as prominent structural elements. The functional roles of hubs in the collective nonlinear dynamics of many such networks, however, are not well understood. Here we propose that hubs in neural circuits may activate local signal transmission along sequences of specific subnetworks. Intriguingly, in contrast to previous suggestions of the functional roles of hubs, here not the hubs themselves, but non-hub subnetworks transfer the signals. The core mechanism relies on hubs and non-hubs providing activating feedback to each other. It may thus induce the propagation of specific pulse and rate signals in neuronal and other communication networks.",Human
"Cancer cells can be described as an invasive species that is able to establish itself in a new environment. The concept of niche construction can be utilized to describe the process by which cancer cells terraform their environment, thereby engineering an ecosystem that promotes the genetic fitness of the species. Ecological dispersion theory can then be utilized to describe and model the steps and barriers involved in a successful diaspora as the cancer cells leave the original host organ and migrate to new host organs to successfully establish a new metastatic community. These ecological concepts can be further utilized to define new diagnostic and therapeutic areas for lethal cancers.",Human
"Measures of erythrocytes volume and surface are helpful in several physiological studies, both for zoologists and veterinarians. Whilst diameter and volume are assessed with ease from observations of blood smears and complete blood count, respectively, thickness and surface area, instead, are much more difficult to be obtained. The accurate description of the erythrocyte geometry is given by the equation of the oval of Cassini, but the formulas deriving from it are very complex, comprising elliptic integrals. In this article three solids are proposed as models approximating the erythrocyte: sphere, cylinder and a spheroid with concave caps. Volumes and Surface Areas obtained with these models are compared to those effectively measured.",Human
"Ecologists are interested in understanding and predicting how ecological communities change through time. While it might seem natural to measure this through changes in species' abundances, computational limitations mean transitions between community types are often modelled instead. We present an approach inspired by DNA substitution models that attempts to estimate historic interactions between species, and thus estimate turnover rates in ecological communities. Although our simulations show that the method has some limitations, our application to butterfly community data shows the method can detect signal in real data. Open source C++ code implementing the method is available at http://www.github.com/willpearse/lotto.",Human
"This work presents a modified Kedem-Katchalsky equations for osmosis through nano-pore. osmotic reflection coefficient of a solute was found to be chiefly affected by the entrance of the pore while filtration reflection coefficient can be affected by both the entrance and the internal structure of the pore. Using an analytical method, we get the quantitative relationship between osmotic reflection coefficient and the molecule size. The model is verified by comparing the theoretical results with the reported experimental data of aquaporin osmosis. Our work is expected to pave the way for a better understanding of osmosis in bio-system and to give us new ideas in designing new membranes with better performance.",Human
"In this communication, we propose a model to study the non-equilibrium process by which actin stress fibers develop force in contractile cells. The emphasis here is on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which is necessary to address the mechanics as well as the chemistry of dynamic cell contractility. In this setting we are able to develop a framework that relates (a) the dynamics of force generation within the cell and (b) the cell response to external stimuli to the chemical processes occurring within the cell, as well as to the mechanics of linkage between the stress fibers, focal adhesions and extra-cellular matrix.",Human
"The Phylogenetic Genome Annotator (PGA) is a computer program that enables real-time comparison of 'gene trees' versus 'species trees' obtained from predicted open reading frames of whole genome data. The gene phylogenies are inferred for each individual genome predicted proteins whereas the species phylogenies are inferred from rDNA data. The correlated protein domains, defined by PFAM, are then displayed side-by-side with a phylogeny of the corresponding species. The statistical support of gene clusters (branches) is given by the quartet puzzling method. This analysis readily discriminates paralogs from orthologs, enabling the identification of proteins originated by gene duplications and the prediction of possible functional divergence in groups of similar sequences.",Human
The fractal globule state is a popular model for describing chromatin packing in eukaryotic nuclei. Here we provide a scaling theory and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) computer simulation for the thermal motion of monomers in the fractal globule state. Simulations starting from different entanglement-free initial states show good convergence which provides evidence supporting the existence of unique metastable fractal globule state. We show monomer motion in this state to be sub-diffusive described by $\langle X^2 (t)\rangle \sim t^{\alpha_F}$ with $\alpha_F$ close to 0.4. This result is in good agreement with existing experimental data on the chromatin dynamics which makes an additional argument in support of the fractal globule model of chromatin packing.,Human
"Inside cells, various cargos are transported by teams of molecular motors. Intriguingly, the motors involved generally have opposite pulling directions, and the resulting cargo dynamics is a biased stochastic motion. It is an open question how the cell can control this bias. Here we develop a model which takes explicitly into account the elastic coupling of the cargo with each motor. We show that bias can be simply controlled or even reversed in a counterintuitive manner via a change in the external force exerted on the cargo or a variation of the ATP binding rate to motors. Furthermore, the superdiffusive behavior found at short time scales indicates the emergence of motor cooperation induced by cargo-mediated coupling.",Human
"A hypothesis of singleness of the growth equation for biological objects on different organizational levels and dimensional analysis are used in order to substantiate Schmalhausen's model of ontogenetic growth (the mass of a growing organism is a power function of time). It is stated that such a model is valid only in the initial period of growth. For the whole period of growth, a generalization of Schmalhausen's model is advanced; it provides the same accuracy as previously known models of quantitative description of kinetic curves. Within the scope of the developed model, a number of interesting results related to an allometry and biological time are obtained.",Human
"Consistency and predictability of brain functionalities depend on reproducible activity of a single neuron. We identify a reproducible non-chaotic neuronal phase where deviations between concave response latency profiles of a single neuron do not increase with the number of stimulations. A chaotic neuronal phase emerges at a transition to convex latency profiles which diverge exponentially, indicating irreproducible response timings. Our findings are supported by a quantitative mathematical framework and found robust to periodic and random stimulation patterns. In addition, these results put a bound on the neuronal temporal resolution which can be enhanced below a millisecond using neuronal chains.",Human
"Modeling of DNA-protein interactions is a complex process involving many important time and length scales. This can be facilitated through the use of coarse-grained models which reduce the number of degrees of freedom and allow efficient exploration of binding configurations. It is known that the local structure of DNA can significantly affect its protein-binding properties (i.e. intrinsic curvature in DNA-histone complexes). In a step towards comprehensive DNA-protein modeling, we expand the 3SPN.2 coarse-grained model to include intrinsic shape, and validate the refined model against experimental data including melting temperature, local flexibility, persistence length, and minor groove width profile.",Human
"We consider systems with two competing species whose actions are completely symmetric, with same mobility, reproduction and competition rates. Numerical implementations of the model in two and three-dimensional space show that regions of single species are formed by spontaneous symmetry breaking. We propose a theoretical formalism for describing the static profile of the interfaces of empty spaces separating domains with different species. We compute the topological properties of the interfaces and show that these theoretical functions are useful to the understanding of the dynamics of the network. Finally, we compare the theoretical functions with results from the numerical implementation of the mean field equations and verify that our model fits well the properties of interfaces.",Human
"Understanding how stimuli and synaptic connectivity in uence the statistics of spike patterns in neural networks is a central question in computational neuroscience. Maximum Entropy approach has been successfully used to characterize the statistical response of simultaneously recorded spiking neurons responding to stimuli. But, in spite of good performance in terms of prediction, the fitting parameters do not explain the underlying mechanistic causes of the observed correlations. On the other hand, mathematical models of spiking neurons (neuro-mimetic models) provide a probabilistic mapping between stimulus, network architecture and spike patterns in terms of conditional proba- bilities. In this paper we build an exact analytical mapping between neuro-mimetic and Maximum Entropy models.",Human
"In order to describe two-dimensionally packed cells in epithelial tissues both mathematically and physically, there have been developed several sorts of geometrical models, such as the vertex model, the finite element model, the cell-centered model, the cellular Potts model. So far, in any case, pressures have not neatly been dealt with and curvatures of the cell boundaries have been even omitted through their approximations. We focus on these quantities and formulate them on the vertex model. Thus, a model with the curvatures is constructed and its algorithm is given for simulation. Its possible extensions and applications will also be discussed.",Human
"The convergent interests of different scientific disciplines, from biochemistry to electronics, toward the investigation of protein electrical properties, has promoted the development of a novel bailiwick, the so called proteotronics. The main aim of proteotronics is to propose and achieve innovative electronic devices, based on the selective action of specific proteins. This paper gives a sketch of the fields of applications of proteotronics, by using as significant example the detection of a specific odorant molecule carried out by an olfactory receptor. The experiment is briefly reviewed and its theoretical interpretation given. Further experiments are envisioned and expected results discussed in the perspective of an experimental validation.",Human
"We introduce a simple ecological model describing the spatial organization of two interacting populations whose individuals are indifferent to conspecifics and avoid the proximity to heterospecifics. At small population densities $\Phi$ a non-trivial structure is observed where clusters of individuals arrange into a rhomboidal bipartite network with an average degree of four. For $\Phi\rightarrow0$ the length scale, order parameter and susceptibility of the network exhibit power-law divergences compatible with hyper-scaling, suggesting the existence of a zero density - non-trivial - critical point. At larger densities a critical threshold $\Phi_{c}$ is identified above which the evolution toward a partially ordered configuration is prevented and the system becomes jammed in a fully mixed state.",Human
"Is the brain really operating at a critical point? We study the non-equilibrium properties of a neural network which models the dynamics of the neocortex and argue for optimal quasi-critical dynamics on the Widom line where the correlation length is maximal. We simulate the network and introduce an analytical mean-field approximation, characterize the non-equilibrium phase transition, and present a non-equilibrium phase diagram, which shows that in addition to an ordered and disordered phase, the system exhibits a quasiperiodic phase corresponding to synchronous activity in simulations which may be related to the pathological synchronization associated with epilepsy.",Human
"Persistent Organic Pollutants represent a global ecological concern due to their ability to accumulate in organisms and to spread species-by-species via feeding connections. In this work we focus on the estimation and simulation of the bioaccumulation dynamics of persistent pollutants in the marine ecosystem, and we apply the approach for reconstructing a model of PCBs bioaccumulation in the Adriatic sea, estimated after an extensive review of trophic and PCBs concentration data on Adriatic species. Our estimations evidence the occurrence of PCBs biomagnification in the Adriatic food web, together with a strong dependence of bioaccumulation on trophic dynamics and external factors like fishing activity.",Human
"Information transmission in cells occurs quite accurately even when concentration changes are ""read"" by individual target molecules. In this Letter we study molecule number fluctuations when molecules diffuse and react. We show that, for immobile binding sites, fluctuations in the number of bound molecules are averaged out on a relatively fast timescale due to correlations. This result can explain the observed co-existence of highly fluctuating instantaneous transcriptional activities and of relatively stable protein concentrations shortly after the beginning of transcription. We also show that bound molecule numbers fluctuate with one or two characteristic timescales depending on the concentration of free molecules. This transition can explain changes in enzyme activity observed at the single molecule level.",Human
"Noise induced excitability is studied in type I and II Morris-Lecar neurons subject to constant sub threshold input, where fluctuations arise from sodium and potassium ion channels. Ion channels open and close randomly, creating current fluctuations that can induce spontaneous firing of action potentials. Both noise sources are assumed to be weak so that spontaneous action potentials occur on a longer timescale than ion channel fluctuations. Asymptotic approximations of the stationary density function and most probable paths are developed to understand the role of channel noise in spontaneous excitability. Even though the deterministic dynamical behavior of type I and II action potentials differ, results show that a single mechanism explains how ion channel noise generates spontaneous action potentials.",Human
"The eukaryotic flagellum beats with apparently unfailing periodicity, yet responds rapidly to stimuli. Like the human heartbeat, flagellar oscillations are now known to be noisy. Using the alga \textit{C. reinhardtii}, we explore three aspects of nonuniform flagellar beating. We report the existence of rhythmicity, waveform noise peaking at transitions between power and recovery strokes, and fluctuations of interbeat intervals that are correlated and even recurrent, with memory extending to hundreds of beats. These features are altered qualitatively by physiological perturbations. Further, we quantify the recovery of periodic breastroke beating from transient hydrodynamic forcing. These results will help constrain microscopic theories on the origins and regulation of flagellar beating.",Human
"The large scale behaviour of a population of cells that grow and interact through the concentration field of the chemicals they secrete is studied using dynamical renormalization group methods. The combination of the effective long-range chemotactic interaction and lack of number conservation leads to a rich variety of phase behaviour in the system, which includes a sharp transition from a phase that has moderate (or controlled) growth and regulated chemical interactions to a phase with strong (or uncontrolled) growth and no chemical interactions. The transition point has nontrivial critical exponents. Our results might help shed light on the interplay between chemical signalling and growth in tissues and colonies, and in particular on the challenging problem of cancer metastasis.",Human
"Breast cancer has been reported to account for the maximum cases among all female cancers till date. In order to gain a deeper insight into the complexities of the disease, we analyze the breast cancer network and its normal counterpart at the proteomic level. While the short range correlations in the eigenvalues exhibiting universality provide an evidence towards the importance of random connections in the underlying networks, the long range correlations along with the localization properties reveal insightful structural patterns involving functionally important proteins. The analysis provides a benchmark for designing drugs which can target a subgraph instead of individual proteins.",Human
"Two separated levels of functionality are identified in the nanostructure which covers the wings of the grey cicada $\textit{Cicada orni}$ (Hemiptera). The upper level is responsible for superhydrophobic character of the wing while the lower level enhances its anti-reflective behavior. Extensive wetting experiments with various chemical species and optical measurements were performed in order to assess the bi-functionality. Scanning electron microscopy imaging was used to identify the nanostructure morphology. Numerical optical simulations and analytical wetting models were used to prove the roles of both levels of the nanostructure. In addition, the complex refractive index of the chitinous material of the wing was determined from measurements.",Human
"Analysis of high-density superresolution imaging of receptors reveal the organization of dendrites at the nano-scale resolution. We present here simulations in empirical live cell images, which allows converting local information extracted from short range trajectories into simulations of long range trajectories. Based on these empirical simulations, we compute the residence time of an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) in dendritic spines that accounts for receptors local interactions and geometrical organization. We report here that depending on the type of the spine, the residence time varies from one to five minutes. Moreover, we show that there exists transient organized structures, previously described as potential wells that can regulate the trafficking of AMPARs to dendritic spines.",Human
"Nowadays massive amount of data are available for analysis in natural and social systems. Inferring system structures from the data, i.e., the inverse problem, has become one of the central issues in many disciplines and interdisciplinary studies. In this Letter, we study the inverse problem of stochastic dynamic complex networks. We derive analytically a simple and universal inference formula called double correlation matrix (DCM) method. Numerical simulations confirm that the DCM method can accurately depict both network structures and noise correlations by using available kinetic data only. This inference performance was never regarded possible by theoretical derivation, numerical computation and experimental design.",Human
"We present a droplet-based surface acoustic wave (SAW) system designed to viably detach biological cells from a surface and sort cell types based on differences in adhesion strength (adhesion contrast), without the need to label cells with molecular markers. The system uses modulated SAW to generate pulsatile flows in the droplets and efficiently detach the cells, thereby minimizing SAW excitation power and exposure time. As a proof-of-principle, the system is shown to efficiently sort HEK 293 from A7r5 cells based on adhesion contrast. Results are obtained in minutes with sorting purity and efficiency reaching 97 % and 95 %, respectively.",Human
"The human microbiome is the ensemble of genes in the microbes that live inside and on the surface of humans. Because microbial sequencing information is now much easier to come by than phenotypic information, there has been an explosion of sequencing and genetic analysis of microbiome samples. Much of the analytical work for these sequences involves phylogenetics, at least indirectly, but methodology has developed in a somewhat different direction than for other applications of phylogenetics. In this paper I review the field and its methods from the perspective of a phylogeneticist, as well as describing current challenges for phylogenetics coming from this type of work.",Human
"The marriage of two vibrant fields---photonics and neuromorphic processing---is fundamentally enabled by the strong analogies within the underlying physics between the dynamics of biological neurons and lasers, both of which can be understood within the framework of nonlinear dynamical systems theory. Whereas neuromorphic engineering exploits the biophysics of neuronal computation algorithms to provide a wide range of computing and signal processing applications, photonics offer an alternative approach to neuromorphic systems by exploiting the high speed, high bandwidth, and low crosstalk available to photonic interconnects which potentially grants the capacity for complex, ultrafast categorization and decision-making. Here we highlight some recent progress on this exciting field.",Human
"Developing robust, quantitative methods to optimize resource allocations in response to epidemics has the potential to save lives and minimize health care costs. In this paper, we develop and apply a computationally efficient algorithm that enables us to calculate the complete probability distribution for the final epidemic size in a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. Based on these results, we determine the optimal allocations of a limited quantity of vaccine between two non-interacting populations. We compare the stochastic solution to results obtained for the traditional, deterministic SIR model. For intermediate quantities of vaccine, the deterministic model is a poor estimate of the optimal strategy for the more realistic, stochastic case.",Human
"Phenomenological screening of small molecule libraries for anticancer activity yields potentially interesting candidate molecules, with a bottleneck in the determination of drug targets and the mechanism of anticancer action. A novel approach to drug target deconvolution compares the abundance profiles of proteins expressed in a panel of cells treated with different drugs, and identifies proteins with cell-type independent and drug-specific regulation that is exceptionally strong in relation to the other proteins. Mapping top candidates on known protein networks reveals the mechanism of drug action, while abundant proteins provide a signature of cellular death/survival pathways. The above approach can significantly shorten drug target identification, and thus facilitate the emergence of novel anticancer treatments.",Human
"We present a microscopic model of a disordered viscoelastic active solid, i.e. an active material whose long time behaviour is elastic as opposed to viscous. It is composed of filaments, passive crosslinks and molecular motors powered by stored chemical energy, e.g. actomyosin powered by ATP. Our model allows us to study the collective behaviour of contractile active elements and how their interaction with each other and the passive elastic elements determines the macroscopic mechanical properties of the active material. As a result of the (un)binding dynamics of the active elements, we find that this system provides a highly responsive material with a dynamic mechanical response strongly dependent on the amount of deformation.",Human
"Limitation of resources has been recently introduced as a mechanism for the survival and coexistence of cooperators with defectors in well-mixed populations. Here we examine the same model on a scale-free network. A prisoner's dilemma game on a scale-free network has shown coexistence of cooperators and defectors for the entire range of parameters. Our results show that by introducing the network to the limited resources model, the cooperator-dominated region in the parameter space expands comparing to the results of well-mixed population and the coexistence region becomes narrower. The effect of scale-free network is therefore interpreted as improving the cooperation in the population and reducing the coexistence.",Human
"Based on existing data, we wish to put forward a biological model of motor system on the neuron scale. Then we indicate its implications in statistics and learning. Specifically, neuron firing frequency and synaptic strength are probability estimates in essence. And the lateral inhibition also has statistical implications. From the standpoint of learning, dendritic competition through retrograde messengers is the foundation of conditional reflex and grandmother cell coding. And they are the kernel mechanisms of motor learning and sensory motor integration respectively. Finally, we compare motor system with sensory system. In short, we would like to bridge the gap between molecule evidences and computational models.",Human
"Radical-ion-pair reactions, central in photosynthesis and the avian magnetic compass mechanism, have recently shown to be a paradigm system for applying quantum information science in a biochemical setting. The fundamental quantum master equation describing radical-ion-pair reactions is still under debate. We here use quantum retrodiction to produce a rigorous refinement of the theory put forward in Phys. Rev. E {\bf 83}, 056118 (2011). We also provide a rigorous analysis of the measure of singlet-triplet coherence required for deriving the radical-pair master equation. A Monte-Carlo simulation with single-molecule quantum trajectories supports the self-consistency of our approach.",Human
"The radical pair model has been successful in explaining behavioral characteristics of the geomagnetic compass believed to underlie the navigation capability of certain avian species. In this study, the spin dynamics of the radical pair model and decoherence therein are interpreted from a microscopic state transition point of view. This helps to elucidate the interplay between the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions that enables the avian compass, and the distinctive effects of nuclear and environmental decoherence on it. Using a quantum information theoretic quantifier of coherence, we find that nuclear decoherence induces new structure in the spin dynamics without materially affecting the compass action; environmental decoherence, on the other hand, completely disrupts it.",Human
"All life, including cells and artificial protocells, must integrate diverse molecules into a single unit in order to reproduce. Despite expected pressure to evolve a simple system with the fastest replication speed, the mechanism by which the use of the great variety of components, and the coexistence of diverse cell-types with different compositions are achieved is as yet unknown. Here we show that coexistence of such diverse compositions and cell-types is the result of competitions for a variety of limited resources. We find that a transition to diversity occurs both in chemical compositions and in protocell types, as the resource supply is decreased, when the maximum inflow and consumption of resources are balanced.",Human
"Applications of first passage times in stochastic processes arise across a wide range of length and time scales in biological settings. After an initial technical overview, we survey representative applications and their corresponding models. Within models that are effectively Markovian, we discuss canonical examples of first passage problems spanning applications to molecular dissociation and self-assembly, molecular search, transcription and translation, neuronal spiking, cellular mutation and disease, and organismic evolution and population dynamics. In this last application, a simple model for stem-cell ageing is presented and some results derived. Various approximation methods and the physical and mathematical subtleties that arise in the chosen applications are also discussed.",Human
"The applications of Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) have expanded tremendously in the last 25 years, and the technique has become a staple technique in many biological and biophysical fields. FRET can be used as spectroscopic ruler in various areas such as structural elucidation of biological molecules and their interactions, in vitro assays, in vivo monitoring in cellular research, nucleic acid analysis, signal transduction, light harvesting, and metallic nanomaterials etc. Based on the mechanism of FRET a variety of novel chemical sensors and Biosensors have been developed. This review highlights the recent applications of sensitive and selective ratiometric FRET based sensors.",Human
"Many recent exciting discoveries have revealed the versatility of RNAs and their importance in a variety of cellular functions which are strongly coupled to RNA structures. To understand the functions of RNAs, some structure prediction models have been developed in recent years. In this review, the progress in computational models for RNA structure prediction is introduced and the distinguishing features of many outstanding algorithms are discussed, emphasizing three dimensional (3D) structure prediction. A promising coarse-grained model for predicting RNA 3D structure, stability and salt effect is also introduced briefly. Finally, we discuss the major challenges in the RNA 3D structure modeling.",Human
"We study genetic networks that produce many species of non-coding RNA molecules that are present at a moderate density, as typically exists in the cell. The associations of the many species of these RNA are modeled physically, taking into account the equilibrium constants between bound and unbound states. By including the pair-wise binding of the many RNA species, the network becomes highly interconnected and shows different properties than the usual type of genetic network. It shows much more robustness to mutation, and also rapid evolutionary adaptation in an environment that oscillates in time. This provides a possible explanation for the weak evolutionary constraints seen in much of the non-coding RNA that has been studied.",Human
"The aftermath of influenza infection is determined by a complex set of host-pathogen interactions, where genomic variability on both viral and host sides influences the final outcome. Although there exists large body of literature describing influenza virus variability, only a very small fraction covers the issue of host variance. The goal of this review is to explore the variability of host genes responsible for host-pathogen interactions, paying particular attention to genes responsible for the presence of sialylated glycans in the host endothelial membrane, mucus, genes used by viral immune escape mechanisms, and genes particularly expressed after vaccination, since they are more likely to have a direct influence on the infection outcome.",Human
"We derive explicit, closed-form expressions for the cumulant densities of a multivariate, self-exciting Hawkes point process, generalizing a result of Hawkes in his earlier work on the covariance density and Bartlett spectrum of such processes. To do this, we represent the Hawkes process in terms of a Poisson cluster process and show how the cumulant density formulas can be derived by enumerating all possible ""family trees"", representing complex interactions between point events. We also consider the problem of computing the integrated cumulants, characterizing the average measure of correlated activity between events of different types, and derive the relevant equations.",Human
"Experiments show that macromolecular crowding modestly reduces the size of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) even at volume fraction ($\phi$) similar to that in the cytosol whereas DNA undergoes a coil-to-globule transition at very small $\phi$. We show using a combination of scaling arguments and simulations that the polymer size $\overline{R}_g(\phi)$ depends on $x = \overline{R}_g(0)/D$ where $D$ is the $\phi$-dependent distance between the crowders. If $x\lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$, there is only a small decrease in $\overline{R}_g(\phi)$ as $\phi$ increases. When $x\gg \mathcal{O}(1)$, a cooperative coil-to-globule transition is induced. Our theory quantitatively explains a number of experiments.",Human
"Establishing a distance between genomes is a significant problem in computational genomics, because its solution can be used to establish evolutionary relationships including phylogeny.   The ""double cut and join"" (DCJ) model of chromosomal rearrangement proposed by Yancopoulos et al. has received attention as it can model inversions, translocations, fusion and fission on a multichromosomal genome that may contain both linear and circular chromosomes. In this paper, we realize the DCJ operator as a group action on the space of multichromosomal genomes. We study this group action, deriving some properties of the group and finding group-theoretic analogues for the key results in the DCJ theory.",Human
"We study the ensemble velocity of non-processive motor proteins, described with multiple chemical states. In particular, we discuss the velocity as a function of ATP concentration. Even a simple model which neglects the strain-dependence of transition rates, reverse transition rates and nonlinearities in the elasticity can show interesting functional dependencies, which deviate significantly from the frequently assumed Michaelis-Menten form. We discuss how the oder of events in the duty cycle can be inferred from the measured dependence. The model also predicts the possibility of velocity reversal at a certain ATP concentration if the duty cycle contains several conformational changes of opposite directionalities.",Human
"A three-dimensional hydrodynamical model for a micro random walker is combined with the idea of chemotactic signaling network of E. coli. Diffusion exponents, orientational correlation functions and their dependence on the geometrical and dynamical parameters of the system are analyzed numerically. Because of the chemotactic memory, the walker shows superdiffusing displacements in all directions with the largest diffusion exponent for a direction along the food gradient. Mean square displacements and orientational correlation functions show that the chemotactic memory washes out all the signatures due to the geometrical asymmetry of the walker and statistical properties are asymmetric only with respect to the direction of food gradient. For different values of the memory time, the Chemotactic index (CI) is also calculated.",Human
"Bismuth Ferrite (BFO) nanoparticles (BFO-NP) display interesting optical (nonlinear response) and magnetic properties which make them amenable for bio-oriented applications as intra- and extra membrane contrast agents. Due to the relatively recent availability of this material in well dispersed nanometric form, its biocompatibility was not known to date. In this study, we present a thorough assessment of the effects of in vitro exposure of human adenocarcinoma (A549), lung squamous carcinoma (NCI-H520), and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell lines to uncoated and poly(ethylene glycol)-coated BFO-NP in the form of cytotoxicity, haemolytic response and biocompatibility. Our results support the attractiveness of the functional-BFO towards biomedical applications focused on advanced diagnostic imaging.",Human
"Recent advances in imaging technology now provide us with 3D images of developing organs. These can be used to extract 3D geometries for simulations of organ development. To solve models on growing domains, the displacement fields between consecutive image frames need to be determined. Here we develop and evaluate different landmark-free algorithms for the determination of such displacement fields from image data. In particular, we examine minimal distance, normal distance, diffusion-based and uniform mapping algorithms and test these algorithms with both synthetic and real data in 2D and 3D. We conclude that in most cases the normal distance algorithm is the method of choice and wherever it fails, diffusion-based mapping provides a good alternative.",Human
"We investigate in vitro fibrillation kinetics of the hormone peptide glucagon at various concentrations using confocal microscopy and determine the glucagon fibril persistence length $60 \mu\textrm{m}$. At all concentrations we observe that periods of individual fibril growth are interrupted by periods of stasis. The growth probability is large at high and low concentrations and is reduced for intermediate glucagon concentrations. To explain this behavior we propose a simple model, where fibrils come in two forms, one built entirely from glucagon monomers and one entirely from glucagon trimers. The opposite building blocks act as fibril growth blockers, and this generic model reproduces experimental behavior well.",Human
Chlamydomonas shows both positive and negative phototaxis. It has a single eyespot near its equator and as the cell rotates during forward motion the light signal received by the eyespot varies. We use a simple mechanical model of Chlamydomonas that couples the flagellar beat pattern to the light intensity at the eyespot to demonstrate a mechanism for phototactic steering that is consistent with observations. The direction of phototaxis is controlled by a parameter in our model and the steering mechanism is robust to noise. Our model shows switching between directed phototaxis when the light is on and run-and-tumble behaviour in the dark.,Human
"Nonlinear systems are capable of displaying complex behavior even if this is the result of a small number of interacting time scales. A widely studied case is when complex dynamics emerges out of a nonlinear system being forced by a simple harmonic function. In order to identify if a recorded time series is the result of a nonlinear system responding to a simpler forcing, we develop a discrete nonlinear transformation for time series based on synchronization techniques. This allows a parameter estimation procedure which simultaneously searches for a good fit of the recorded data, and small complexity of a fluctuating driving parameter. We illustrate this procedure using data from respiratory patterns during birdsong production.",Human
"We propose a novel OCT-based method for visualizing microvasculature in 3D using reference-free processing of individual complex-valued B-scans with highly overlapped A-scans. In the lateral direction of such a B-scan, the amplitude and phase of speckles corresponding to vessel regions exhibit faster variability, and thus can be detected without comparison with other B-scans recorded in the same plane. This method combines elements of several existing OCT angiographic approaches, and exhibits: (i) enhanced robustness with respect to bulk tissue motion with frequencies up to tens of Hz; (ii) resolution of microcirculation images equal to that of structural images and (iii) possibility of quantifying the vessels in terms of their decorrelation rates.",Human
"Coordinated motion of cell monolayers during epithelial wound healing and tissue morphogenesis involves mechanical stress generation. Here we propose a model for the dynamics of epithelial expansion that couples mechanical deformations in the tissue to contractile activity and polarization in the cells. A new ingredient of our model is a feedback between local strain, polarization and contractility that naturally yields a mechanism for viscoelasticity and effective inertia in the cell monolayer. Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we demonstrate that our model quantitatively reproduces many experimental findings [Nat. Phys. 8, 628 (2012)], including the build-up of intercellular stresses, and the existence of traveling mechanical waves guiding the oscillatory monolayer expansion.",Human
"We study the thermodynamics and kinetics of an RNA toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction with a recently developed coarse-grained model of RNA. Strand displacement, during which a single strand displaces a different strand previously bound to a complementary substrate strand, is an essential mechanism in active nucleic acid nanotechnology and has also been hypothesized to occur in vivo. We study the rate of displacement reactions as a function of the length of the toehold and temperature and make two experimentally testable predictions: that the displacement is faster if the toehold is placed at the 5' end of the substrate and that the displacement slows down with increasing temperature for longer toeholds.",Human
"Fundamental biological processes such as transcription and translation, where a genetic sequence is sequentially read by a macromolecule, have been well described by a classical model of non-equilibrium statistical physics, the totally asymmetric exclusion principle (TASEP). This model describes particles hopping between sites of a one-dimensional lattice, with the particle current determining the transcription or translation rate. An open problem is how to analyze a TASEP where particles can pause randomly, as has been observed during transcription. In this work, we report that surprisingly, a simple mean-field model predicts well the particle current for all values of the average pause duration, using a simple description of blocking behind paused particles.",Human
"When cellular contractile forces are central to pathophysiology, these forces comprise a logical target of therapy. Nevertheless, existing high-throughput screens are limited to upstream signaling intermediates with poorly defined relationship to such a physiological endpoint. Using cellular force as the target, here we screened libraries to identify novel drug candidates in the case of human airway smooth muscle cells in the context of asthma, and also in the case of Schlemm's canal endothelial cells in the context of glaucoma. This approach identified several drug candidates for both asthma and glaucoma. We attained rates of 1000 compounds per screening day, thus establishing a force-based cellular platform for high-throughput drug discovery.",Human
"Many transport processes in nature exhibit anomalous diffusive properties with non-trivial scaling of the mean square displacement, e.g., diffusion of cells or of biomolecules inside the cell nucleus, where typically a crossover between different scaling regimes appears over time. Here, we investigate a class of anomalous diffusion processes that is able to capture such complex dynamics by virtue of a general waiting time distribution. We obtain a complete characterization of such generalized anomalous processes, including their functionals and multi-point structure, using a representation in terms of a normal diffusive process plus a stochastic time change. In particular, we derive analytical closed form expressions for the two-point correlation functions, which can be readily compared with experimental data.",Human
"Male reproductive health in both humans and animals is an important research field in biological study. In order to characterize the morphology, the motility and the concentration of the sperm cells, which are the most important parameters to feature them, digital holography demonstrated to be an attractive technique. Indeed, it is a labelfree, non-invasive and high-resolution method that enables the characterization of live specimen. The review is intended both for summarize the state-of-art on the semen analysis and recent achievement obtained by means of digital holography and for exploring new possible applications of digital holography in this field.",Human
"Endocytosis underlies many cellular functions including signaling and nutrient uptake. The endocytosed cargo gets redistributed across a dynamic network of endosomes undergoing fusion and fission. Here, a theoretical approach is reviewed which can explain how the microscopic properties of endosome interactions cause the emergent macroscopic properties of cargo trafficking in the endosomal network. Predictions by the theory have been tested experimentally and include the inference of dependencies and parameter values of the microscopic processes. This theory could also be used to infer mechanisms of signal-trafficking crosstalk. It is applicable to in vivo systems since fixed samples at few time points suffice as input data.",Human
"Cancer cells co-cultured in vitro reveal unexpected differential growth rates that classical exponential growth models cannot account for. Two non-interacting cell lines were grown in the same culture, and counts of each species were recorded at periodic times. The relative growth of population ratios was found to depend on the initial proportion, in contradiction with the traditional exponential growth model. The proposed explanation is the variability of growth rates for clones inside the same cell line. This leads to a log-quadratic growth model that provides both a theoretical explanation to the phenomenon that was observed, and a better fit to our growth data.",Human
"Solvation is essential for protein activities. To study internal solvation of protein, site-directed mutagenesis is applied. Intrinsic fluorescent probe, tryptophan, is inserted into desired position inside protein molecule for ultrafast spectroscopic study. Here we review this unique method for protein dynamics researches. We introduce the frontiers of protein solvation, site-directed mutagenesis, protein stability and characteristics, and the spectroscopic methods. Then we present time-resolved spectroscopic dynamics of solvation dynamics inside caves of active sites. The studies are carried out on a globular protein, staphylococcal nuclease. The solvation at internal sites of the caves indicate clear characteristics of local environment. These solvation behaviors correlated to the enzyme activity directly.",Human
"We present a fluorescence-lifetime based method for monitoring cell and tissue activity in situ, during cell culturing and in the presence of a strong autofluorescence background. The miniature fiber-optic probes are easily incorporated in the tight space of a cell culture chamber or in an endoscope. As a first application we monitored the cytosolic calcium levels in porcine tracheal explant cultures using the Calcium Green-5N (CG5N) indicator. Despite the simplicity of the optical setup we are able to detect changes of calcium concentration as small as 2.5 nM, with a monitoring time resolution of less than 1 s.",Human
"Many recently introduced enhanced sampling techniques are based on biasing coarse descriptors (collective variables) of a molecular system on the fly. Sometimes the calculation of such collective variables is expensive and becomes a bottleneck in molecular dynamics simulations. An algorithm to treat smooth biasing forces within a multiple time step framework is here discussed. The implementation is simple and allows a speed up when expensive collective variables are employed. The gain can be substantial when using massively parallel or GPU-based molecular dynamics software. Moreover, a theoretical framework to assess the sampling accuracy is introduced, which can be used to assess the choice of the integration time step in both single and multiple time step biased simulations.",Human
"We have conducted a pilot clinical study to not only investigate the THz spectra of ex-vivo fresh human whole blood of 28 patients following 8-hours fasting guideline, but also to find out the critical blood ingredients of which the concentration dominantly affects those THz spectra. A great difference between the THz absorption properties of human blood among different people was observed, while the difference can be up to ~15% of the averaged absorption coefficient of the 28 samples. Our pilot clinical study indicates that triglyceride and red blood cell were two dominant factors to have significant clinically defined negative correlation to the sub-THz absorption coefficients.",Human
"We analyse a generic motility model, with the motility mechanism arising by contractile stress due to the interaction of myosin and actin. A hydrodynamic active polar gel theory is used to model the cytoplasm of a cell and is combined with a Helfrich-type model to account for membrane properties. The overall model allows to consider motility without the necessity for local adhesion. Besides a detailed numerical approach together with convergence studies for the highly nonlinear free boundary problem, we also compare the induced flow field of the motile cell with that of classical squirmer models and identify the motile cell as a puller or pusher, depending on the strength of the myosin-actin interactions.",Human
"Here, we investigated the influence of physicochemical characteristics of chondroitin sulfate (CS) on its in vitro absorption and anti-inflammatory activity. We used eight different synthetic and natural CS samples with a range of molecular weights (7-35 kDa) and sulfation patterns. Our studies indicate that the absorption of CS is moderately correlated to percentage of chondroitin-6-sulfate while the anti-inflammatory activity may be weakly related to the molecular weight and the amount of total sulfation in the samples. Our in vitro studies could provide helpful screening tools for quick and effective evaluation of CS samples as a preliminary step towards in vivo studies.",Human
"After colliding with a surface, microswimmers reside there during the detention time. They accumulate and may form complex structures such as biofilms. We introduce a general framework to calculate the distribution of detention times using the method of first-passage times and study how rotational noise and hydrodynamic interactions influence the escape from a surface. We compare generic swimmer models to the simple active Brownian particle. While the respective detention times of source dipoles are smaller, the ones of pullers are larger by up to several orders of magnitude, and pushers show both trends. We apply our results to the more realistic squirmer model, for which we use lubrication theory, and validate them by simulations with multi-particle collision dynamics.",Human
"The flavin reductase ActVB is involved in the last step of actinorhodin biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor. Although ActVB can be isolated with some FMN bound, this form was not involved in the flavin reductase activity. By studying the ferric reductase activity of ActVB, we show that its FMN-bound form exhibits a proper enzymatic activity of reduction of iron complexes by NADH. This shows that ActVB active site exhibits a dual property with regard to the FMN. It can use it as a substrate that goes in and off the active site or as a cofactor to provide an electron transferase activity to the polypeptide.",Human
"We propose a metric which can be used to compute the amount of heritable variation enabled by a given dynamical system. A distribution of selection pressures is used such that each pressure selects a particular fixed point via competitive exclusion in order to determine the corresponding distribution of potential fixed points in the population dynamics. This metric accurately detects the number of species present in artificially prepared test systems, and furthermore can correctly determine the number of heritable sets in clustered transition matrix models in which there are no clearly defined genomes. Finally, we apply our metric to the GARD model and show that it accurately reproduces prior measurements of the model's heritability.",Human
"This contribution provides a general framework to use Lagrange multipliers for the simulation of low Reynolds number fiber dynamics based on Bead Models (BM). This formalism provides an efficient method to account for kinematic constraints. We illustrate, with several examples, to which extent the proposed formulation offers a flexible and versatile framework for the quantitative modeling of flexible fibers deformation and rotation in shear flow, the dynamics of actuated filaments and the propulsion of active swimmers. Furthermore, a new contact model called Gears Model is proposed and successfully tested. It avoids the use of numerical artifices such as repulsive forces between adjacent beads, a source of numerical difficulties in the temporal integration of previous Bead Models.",Human
"Polymer brushes are increasingly used to tailor surface physicochemistry for various applications such as wetting, adhesion of biological objects, implantable devices, etc. We perform Dissipative Particle Dynamics simulations to study the behavior of dense polymer brushes under flow in a slit-pore channel. We discover that the system displays flow inversion at the brush interface for several disconnected ranges of the imposed flow. We associate such phenomenon to collective polymer dynamics: a wave propagating on the brush surface. The relation between the wavelength, the amplitude and the propagation speed of the flow-generated wave is consistent with the solution of the Stokes equations when an imposed traveling wave is assumed as boundary condition (the famous Taylor's swimmer).",Human
"Genome rearrangements are evolutionary events that shuffle genomic architectures. Most frequent genome rearrangements are reversals, translocations, fusions, and fissions. While there are some more complex genome rearrangements such as transpositions, they are rarely observed and believed to constitute only a small fraction of genome rearrangements happening in the course of evolution. The analysis of transpositions is further obfuscated by intractability of the underlying computational problems.   We propose a computational method for estimating the rate of transpositions in evolutionary scenarios between genomes. We applied our method to a set of mammalian genomes and estimated the transpositions rate in mammalian evolution to be around 0.26.",Human
"Concentration gradients of signaling molecules are essential for patterning during development and they have been observed in both unicellular and multicellular systems. In subcellular systems, clustering of the signaling molecule has been observed. We develop a theoretical model of cluster- mediated concentration gradient formation based on the Becker-Doring equations of aggregation- fragmentation processes. We show that such a mechanism produces robust concentration gradients on realistic time and spatial scales so long as the process of clustering does not significantly stabilize the signaling molecule. Finally, we demonstrate that such a model is applicable to the pom1p subcellular gradient in fission yeast.",Human
"We present an algorithm to estimate the configurational entropy $S$ of a polymer. The algorithm uses the statistics of coincidences among random samples of configurations and is related to the catch-tag-release method for estimation of population sizes, and to the classic ""birthday paradox"". Bias in the entropy estimation is decreased by grouping configurations in nearly equiprobable partitions based on their energies, and estimating entropies separately within each partition. Whereas most entropy estimation algorithms require $N\sim 2^{S}$ samples to achieve small bias, our approach typically needs only $N\sim \sqrt{2^{S}}$. Thus the algorithm can be applied to estimate protein free energies with increased accuracy and decreased computational cost.",Human
"We use a popular fictional disease, zombies, in order to introduce techniques used in modern epidemiology modelling, and ideas and techniques used in the numerical study of critical phenomena. We consider variants of zombie models, from fully connected continuous time dynamics to a full scale exact stochastic dynamic simulation of a zombie outbreak on the continental United States. Along the way, we offer a closed form analytical expression for the fully connected differential equation, and demonstrate that the single person per site two dimensional square lattice version of zombies lies in the percolation universality class. We end with a quantitative study of the full scale US outbreak, including the average susceptibility of different geographical regions.",Human
"Optical or electrical stimulation of neural circuits in mice during natural behavior is an important paradigm for studying brain function. Conventional systems for optogenetics and electrical microstimulation require tethers or large head-mounted devices that disrupt animal behavior. We report a method for wireless powering of small-scale implanted devices based on the strong localization of energy that occurs during resonant interaction between a radio-frequency cavity and intrinsic modes in mice. The system features self-tracking over a wide (16 cm diameter) operational area, and is used to demonstrate wireless activation of cortical neurons with miniaturized stimulators (10 mm$^{3}$, 20 mg) fully implanted under the skin.",Human
"In this paper, we study the effects of spike timing-dependent plasticity on synchronisation in a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. Neuron plasticity is a flexible property of a neuron and its network to change temporarily or permanently their biochemical, physiological, and morphological characteristics, in order to adapt to the environment. Regarding the plasticity, we consider Hebbian rules, specifically for spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and with regard to network, we consider that the connections are randomly distributed. We analyse the synchronisation and desynchronisation according to an input level and probability of connections. Moreover, we verify that the transition for synchronisation depends on the neuronal network architecture, and the external perturbation level.",Human
"We introduce a scale-free method for testing the proportionality of branch lengths between two phylogenetic trees that have the same topology and contain the same set of taxa. This method scales both trees to a total length of 1 and sums up the differences for each branch. Compared to previous methods, ours yields a fully symmetrical score that measures proportionality without being affected by scale. We call this score the normalized tree distance (NTD). Based on real data, we demonstrate that NTD scores are distributed unimodally, in a manner similar to a lognormal distribution. The NTD score can be used to, for example, detect co-evolutionary processes and measure the accuracy of branch length estimates.",Human
"A three-dimensional unilateral contact problem for articular cartilage layers attached to subchondral bones shaped as elliptic paraboloids is considered in the framework of the biphasic cartilage model. The main novelty of the study is in accounting not only for the normal (vertical), but also for tangential vertical (horisontal) displacements of the contacting surfaces. Exact general relationships have been established between the contact approach and some integral characteristics of the contact pressure, including the contact force. Asymptotic representations for the contact pressure integral characteristics are obtained in terms of the contact approach and some integral characteristics of the contact zone. The main result is represented by the first-order approximation problem.",Human
"During cell division, sister chromatids are segregated by the mitotic spindle, a bipolar assembly of interdigitating antiparallel polar filaments called microtubules. Establishing a stable overlap region is essential for maintenance of bipolarity, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a particle-based stochastic model, we find that the interplay of motors and passive cross linkers can robustly generate partial overlaps between antiparallel filaments. Our analysis shows that motors reduce the overlap in a length-dependent manner, whereas passive cross linkers increase it independently of the length. In addition to maintaining structural integrity, passive cross linkers can thus also have a dynamic role for size regulation.",Human
The thermodynamical stability of DNA minicircles is investigated by means of path integral techniques. Hydrogen bonds between base pairs on complementary strands can be broken by thermal fluctuations and temporary fluctuational openings along the double helix are essential to biological functions such as transcription and replication of the genetic information. Helix unwinding and bubble formation patterns are computed in circular sequences with variable radius in order to analyze the interplay between molecule size and appearance of helical disruptions. The latter are found in minicircles with $< 100$ base pairs and appear as a strategy to soften the stress due to the bending and torsion of the helix.,Human
"Neurons in many brain areas can develop pronounced depolarized state of membrane potential (up state) in addition to the normal hyperpolarized down state near the resting potential. The influence of the up state on signal encoding, however, is not well investigated. Here we construct a one-dimensional bistable neuron model and calculate the linear response to noisy oscillatory inputs analytically. We find that with the appearance of an up state, the transmission function is enhanced by the emergence of a local maximum at some optimal frequency and the phase lag relative to the input signal is reduced. We characterize the dependence of the enhancement of frequency response on intrinsic dynamics and on the occupancy of the up state.",Human
"We present p53-MDM2-Glucose model to study spatio-temporal properties of the system induced by glucose. The variation in glucose concentration level triggers the system at different states, namely, oscillation death (stabilized), sustain and damped oscillations which correspond to various cellular states. The transition of these states induced by glucose is phase transition like behaviour. We also found that the intrinsic noise in stochastic system helps the system to stabilize more effectively. Further, the amplitude of $p53$ dynamics with the variation of glucose concentration level follows power law behaviour, $A_s(k)\sim k^\gamma$, where, $\gamma$ is a constant.",Human
"We study the efficiency of synchronization in ensembles of identical coupled stochastic oscillator systems. By deriving a chemical Langevin equation, we measure the rate at which the systems synchronize. The rate at which the difference in the Hilbert phases of the systems evolve provides a suitable order parameter, and a 2--dimensional recurrence plot further facilitates the analysis of stochastic synchrony. We find that a global mean--field coupling effects the most rapid approach to global synchrony, and that when the number of ""information carrying"" molecular species increases, the rate of synchrony increases. The Langevin analysis is complemented by numerical simulations.",Human
"Protein distributions measured under a broad set of conditions in bacteria and yeast were shown to exhibit a common skewed shape, with variances depending quadratically on means. For bacteria these properties were reproduced by temporal measurements of protein content, showing accumulation and division across generations. Here we present a stochastic growth-and-division model with feedback which captures these observed properties. The limiting copy number distribution is calculated exactly, and a single parameter is found to determine the distribution shape and the variance-to-mean relation. Estimating this parameter from bacterial temporal data reproduces the measured distribution shape with high accuracy, and leads to predictions for future experiments.",Human
"The course of a peritrichous bacterium such as E. coli crucially depends on the level of synchronization and self-organization of several rotating flagella. However, the rotation of each flagellum generates counter body movements which in turn affect the flagellar dynamics. Using a detailed numerical model of an E. coli, we demonstrate that flagellar entanglement, besides fluid flow relative to the moving body, dramatically changes the dynamics of flagella from that compared to anchored flagella. In particular, bundle formation occurs through a zipping motion in a remarkably rapid time, affected little by initial flagellar orientation. A simplified analytical model supports our observations. Finally, we illustrate how entanglement, hydrodynamic interactions, and body movement contribute to zipping and bundling.",Human
"We propose the use of the subwavelength localization via adiabatic passage technique for fluorescence microscopy with nanoscale resolution in the far field. This technique uses a {\Lambda}-type medium coherently coupled to two laser pulses: the pump, with a node in its spatial profile, and the Stokes. The population of the {\Lambda} system is adiabatically transferred from one ground state to the other except at the node position, yielding a narrow population peak. This coherent localization allows fluorescence imaging with nanometer lateral resolution. We derive an analytical expression to asses the resolution and perform a comparison with the coherent population trapping and the stimulated-emission-depletion techniques.",Human
"We describe a percolation-type approach to modeling of the processes of aging and certain other properties of tissues analyzed as systems consisting of interacting cells. Tissues are considered as structures made of regular healthy, senescent, dead (apoptotic) cells, and studied dynamically, with the ongoing processes including regular cell division to fill vacant sites left by dead cells, healthy cells becoming senescent or dying, and other processes. Statistical-mechanics description can provide patterns of time dependence and snapshots of morphological system properties. An illustrative application of the developed theoretical modeling approach is reported, confirming recent experimental findings that inhibition of senescence can lead to extended lifespan.",Human
"To adapt their behaviour in changing environments, cells sense concentrations by binding external ligands to their receptors. However, incorrect ligands may bind nonspecifically to receptors, and when their concentration is large, this binding activity may interfere with the sensing of the ligand of interest. Here, I derive analytically the physical limit to the accuracy of concentration sensing amid a large number of interfering ligands. A scaling transition is found when the mean bound time of correct ligands is twice that of incorrect ligands. I discuss how the physical bound can be approached by a cascade of receptor states generalizing kinetic proof-reading schemes.",Human
"We present a continuum theory of self-propelled particles, without alignment interactions, in a momentum-conserving solvent. To address phase separation we introduce a scalar concentration field $\phi$ with advective-diffusive dynamics. Activity creates a contribution $\Sigma_{ij}=-\zeta((\partial_i\phi)(\partial_j\phi)-(\nabla\phi)^{2}\delta_{ij}/d)$ to the deviatoric stress, where $\zeta$ is odd under time reversal and $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions; this causes an effective interfacial tension contribution that is negative for contractile swimmers. We predict that domain growth then ceases at a length scale where diffusive coarsening is balanced by active stretching of interfaces, and confirm this numerically. Thus the interplay of activity and hydrodynamics is highly nontrivial, even without alignment interactions.",Human
"Some cells have to take decision based on the quality of surroundings ligands, almost irrespective of their quantity, a problem we name ""absolute discrimination"". An example of absolute discrimination is recognition of not-self by immune T Cells. We show how the problem of absolute discrimination can be solved by a process called ""adaptive sorting"". We review several implementations of adaptive sorting, as well as its generic properties such as antagonism. We show how kinetic proofreading with negative feedback implements an approximate version of adaptive sorting in the immune context. Finally, we revisit the decision problem at the cell population level, showing how phenotypic variability and feedbacks between population and single cells are crucial for proper decision.",Human
"Cells modify their volume in response to changes in osmotic pressure but it is usually assumed that other active shape variations do not involve significant volume fluctuations. Here we report experiments demonstrating that water transport in and out of the cell is needed for the formation of blebs, commonly observed protrusions in the plasma membrane driven by cortex contraction. We develop and simulate a model of fluid mediated membrane-cortex deformations and show that a permeable membrane is necessary for bleb formation which is otherwise impaired. Taken together our experimental and theoretical results emphasize the subtle balance between hydrodynamics and elasticity in actively driven cell morphological changes.",Human
"Despite the spectacular achievements of molecular biology in the second half of the twentieth century and the crucial advances it permitted in cancer research, the fight against cancer has brought some disillusions. It is nowadays more and more apparent that getting a global picture of the very diverse and interlinked aspects of cancer development necessitates, in synergy with these achievements, other perspectives and investigating tools. In this undertaking, multidisciplinary approaches that include quantitative sciences in general and physics in particular play a crucial role. This `focus on' collection contains 19 articles representative of the diversity and state-of-the-art of the contributions that physics can bring to the field of cancer research.",Human
"In this article the notion of metabolic turnover is revisited in the light of recent results of out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. By means of Monte Carlo methods we perform an exact uniform sampling of the steady state fluxes in a genome scale metabolic network of E Coli from which we infer the metabolites turnover times. However the latter are inferred from net fluxes, and we argue that this approximation is not valid for enzymes working nearby thermodynamic equilibrium. We recalculate turnover times from total fluxes by performing an energy balance analysis of the network and recurring to the fluctuation theorem. We find in many cases values one of order of magnitude lower, implying a faster picture of intermediate metabolism.",Human
"A simple nonlinear transmission-line model of the cochlea with longitudinal coupling is introduced that can reproduce Basilar membrane response and neural tuning in the chinchilla. It is found that the middle ear has little effect on cochlear resonances, and hence conclude that the theory of coherent reflections is not applicable to the model. The model also provides an explanation of the emergence of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs). It is argued that SOAEs arise from Hopf bifurcations of the transmission-line model and not from localized instabilities. The paper shows that emissions can become chaotic, intermittent and fragile to perturbations.",Human
"We propose a model for the dynamics of a probe embedded in a living cell, where both thermal fluctuations and nonequilibrium activity coexist. The model is based on a confining harmonic potential describing the elastic cytoskeletal matrix, which undergoes random active hops as a result of the nonequilibrium rearrangements within the cell. We describe the probe's statistics and we bring forth quantities affected by the nonequilibrium activity. We find an excellent agreement between the predictions of our model and experimental results for tracers inside living cells. Finally, we exploit our model to arrive at quantitative predictions for the parameters characterizing nonequilibrium activity, such as the typical time scale of the activity and the amplitude of the active fluctuations.",Human
"Mating preferences of many biological species are not constant but season-dependent. Within the framework of evolutionary game theory this can be modeled with two finite opposite-sex populations playing against each other following the rules that are periodically changing. By combining Floquet theory and the concept of quasi-stationary distributions, we reveal existence of metastable time-periodic states in the evolution of finite game-driven populations. The evolutionary Floquet states correspond to time-periodic probability flows in the strategy space which cannot be resolved within the mean-field framework. The lifetime of metastable Floquet states increases with the size $N$ of populations so that they become attractors in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$.",Human
"The effect of fat content in cheese curds on their rheological properties was examined using dynamic shear measurements. Surplus fat addition to milk samples caused two distinct types of changes in the temperature dependence of the viscoelastic moduli of resultant curds. The first was a significant reduction in the moduli over a wide temperature range, which is attributed to the presence of liquefied fat globules within the milk protein network. The second was the excess contribution to the low-temperature moduli owing to the reinforcing effect of solidified fat globules. An upward shift in the sol-gel phase transition temperature driven by an increased fat content was also observed.",Human
"Using molecular dynamics simulations, the structure of model mini-protein was thoroughly characterized in the imidazolium-based amino acid ionic liquids and their aqueous solutions. We report that the mini-protein is more stable when AAIL is added as a cosolvent. Complete substitution of water by organic cations and anions further results in hindered conformational flexibility of the mini-protein. This observation suggests that AAILs are able to defend proteins from thermally induced denaturation. We show by means of radial distributions that the mini-protein is efficiently solvated by both solvents due to agood mutual miscibility. However, amino acid based anions prevail in the first coordination sphere of the mini-protein.",Human
"It is shown how to take advantage of the frequent occurrence of double-strand breaks in the genome of prokaryotic cells, in order to reduce their high efficient reproductive capability. The analysis examines the physical status of the free ends of each break and considers how this status can interfere with an external physical apparatus, with the aim of undermining the repair processes. We indicate the biological consequences of this interaction and we give an approximate evaluation of the topological and dynamical effects that arise on the genomic material involved. The overall result suggests a significant reduction of the dynamics of the repair.",Human
"Cells use surface receptors to estimate the concentration of external ligands. Limits on the accuracy of such estimations have been well studied for pairs of ligand and receptor species. However, the environment typically contains many ligands, which can bind to the same receptors with different affinities, resulting in cross-talk. In traditional rate models, such cross-talk prevents accurate inference of individual ligand concentrations. In contrast, here we show that knowing the precise timing sequence of stochastic binding and unbinding events allows one receptor to provide information about multiple ligands simultaneously and with a high accuracy. We argue that such high-accuracy estimation of multiple concentrations can be realized by the familiar kinetic proofreading mechanism.",Human
"Learning and inferring features that generate sensory input is a task continuously performed by cortex. In recent years, novel algorithms and learning rules have been proposed that allow neural network models to learn such features from natural images, written text, audio signals, etc. These networks usually involve deep architectures with many layers of hidden neurons. Here we review recent advancements in this area emphasizing, amongst other things, the processing of dynamical inputs by networks with hidden nodes and the role of single neuron models. These points and the questions they arise can provide conceptual advancements in understanding of learning in the cortex and the relationship between machine learning approaches to learning with hidden nodes and those in cortical circuits.",Human
"The fundamental theories of physics are local theories, depending on local interactions of local variables. It is not clear if and how strictly local theories can produce non-local variables that have causal effectiveness. Yet, non-local effectiveness appears to exist, such as in the form of memory (non-locality through time) and causally effective spatial structures (non-locality through space). Here it is shown, by construction, how such non-locality can be produced from elementary components: non-isolated systems, multiplicative noise, self-replication, and elimination. A theory is derived that explains how causal non-locality can arise from strictly local interactions.",Human
"We study the mechanical unfolding of a simple model protein. The Langevin dynamics results are analyzed using Markov-model methods which allow to describe completely the configurational space of the system. Using transition path theory we also provide a quantitative description of the unfolding pathways followed by the system. Our study shows a complex dynamical scenario. In particular, we see that the usual one-dimensional picture: free-energy vs end-to-end distance representation, gives a misleading description of the process. Unfolding can occur following different pathways and configurations which seem to play a central role in one-dimensional pictures are not the intermediate states of the unfolding dynamics.",Human
"Biology achieves novel functions like error correction, ultra-sensitivity and accurate concentration measurement at the expense of free energy through Maxwell Demon-like mechanisms. The design principles and free energy trade-offs have been studied for a variety of such mechanisms. In this review, we emphasize a perspective based on dynamical phases that can explain commonalities shared by these mechanisms. Dynamical phases are defined by typical trajectories executed by non-equilibrium systems in the space of internal states. We find that coexistence of dynamical phases can have dramatic consequences for function vs free energy cost trade-offs. Dynamical phases can also provide an intuitive picture of the design principles behind such biological Maxwell Demons.",Human
"We study the behaviour of double-stranded RNA under twist and tension using oxRNA, a recently developed coarse-grained model of RNA. Introducing explicit salt-dependence into the model allows us to directly compare our results to data from recent single-molecule experiments. The model reproduces extension curves as a function of twist and stretching force, including the buckling transition and the behaviour of plectoneme structures. For negative supercoiling, we predict denaturation bubble formation in plectoneme end-loops, suggesting preferential plectoneme localisation in weak base sequences. OxRNA exhibits a positive twist-stretch coupling constant, in agreement with recent experimental observations.",Human
"We demonstrate that characteristic nodules emerge in cultures of several malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell lines. Instead of excessive local cell proliferation, the nodules arise by Myosin II-driven cell contractility. The aggregation process can be prevented or reversed by suitable pharmacological inhibitors of acto-myosin contractility. A cell-resolved elasto-plastic model of the multicellular patterning process indicates that the morphology and size of the nodules as well as the speed of their formation is determined by the mechanical tension cells exert on their neighbors, and the stability of cell-substrate adhesion complexes. A linear stability analysis of a homogenous, self-tensioned Maxwell fluid indicates the unconditional presence of a patterning instability.",Human
"Nonstationary molecular states which contain electronic coherences can be impulsively created and manipulated by using recently-developed ultrashort optical and X-ray pulses via photoexcitation, photoionization and Auger processes. We propose several stimulated-Raman detection schemes that can monitor the phase-sensitive electronic and nuclear dynamics. Three detection protocols of an X-ray broadband probe are compared - frequency dispersed transmission, integrated photon number change, and total pulse energy change. In addition each can be either linear or quadratic in the X-ray probe intensity. These various signals offer different gating windows into the molecular response which is described by correlation functions of electronic polarizabilities. Off-resonant and resonant signals are compared.",Human
"The observed single-handedness of biological amino acids and sugars has long been attributed to autocatalysis. However, the stability of homochiral states in deterministic autocatalytic systems relies on cross inhibition of the two chiral states, an unlikely scenario for early life self-replicators. Here, we present a theory for a stochastic individual-level model of autocatalysis due to early life self-replicators. Without chiral inhibition, the racemic state is the global attractor of the deterministic dynamics, but intrinsic multiplicative noise stabilizes the homochiral states, in both well-mixed and spatially-extended systems. We conclude that autocatalysis is a viable mechanism for homochirality, without imposing additional nonlinearities such as chiral inhibition.",Human
"We study the effect of intrinsic noise on the thermodynamic balance of complex chemical networks subtending cellular metabolism and gene regulation. A topological network property called deficiency, known to determine the possibility of complex behavior such as multistability and oscillations, is shown to also characterize the entropic balance. In particular, only when deficiency is zero does the average stochastic dissipation rate equal that of the corresponding deterministic model, where correlations are disregarded. In fact, dissipation can be reduced by the effect of noise, as occurs in a toy model of metabolism that we employ to illustrate our findings. This phenomenon highlights that there is a close interplay between deficiency and the activation of new dissipative pathways at low molecule numbers.",Human
"The shapes of branching trees have been linked to disease transmission patterns. In this paper we use the general Crump-Mode-Jagers branching process to model an outbreak of an infectious disease under mild assumptions. Introducing a new class of characteristic functions, we are able to derive a formula for the limit of the frequency of the occurrences of a given shape in a general tree. The computational challenges concerning the evaluation of this formula are in part overcome using the Jumping Chronological Contour Process. We apply the formula to derive the limit of the frequency of cherries, pitchforks and double cherries in the constant rate birth-death model, and the frequency of cherries under a non-constant death rate.",Human
"We present generalized delayed neural network (DNN) model with positive delay feedback and neuron history. The local stability analysis around trivial local equilibria of delayed neural networks has applied and determine the conditions for the existence of zero root. We develop few innovative delayed neural network models in different dimensions through transformation and extension of some existing models. We found that zero root can have multiplicity two under certain conditions. We further show how the characteristic equation can have zero root and its multiplicity is dependent on the conditions undertaken. Finally, we generalize the neural network of $N$ neurons through which we determine the general form of Jacobian of the linear form and corresponding characteristic equation of the system.",Human
"We propose a stochastic individual-based model of the progression of atrial fibrillation (AF). The model operates at patient level over a lifetime and is based on elements of the physiology and biophysics of AF, making contact with existing mechanistic models. The outputs of the model are times when the patient is in normal rhythm and AF, and we carry out a population-level analysis of the statistics of disease progression. While the model is stylised at present and not directly predictive, future improvements are proposed to tighten the gap between existing mechanistic models of AF, and epidemiological data, with a view towards model-based personalised medicine.",Human
"Energy efficiency is closely related to the evolution of biological systems and is important to their information processing. In this paper, we calculated the excitation probability of a simple model of a bistable biological unit in response to pulsatile inputs, and its spontaneous excitation rate due to noise perturbation. Then we analytically calculated the mutual information, energy cost, and energy efficiency of an array of these bistable units. We found that the optimal number of units could maximize this array's energy efficiency in encoding pulse inputs, which depends on the fixed energy cost. We conclude that demand for energy efficiency in biological systems may strongly influence the size of these systems under the pressure of natural selection.",Human
"Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that energy efficiency, which measures the amount of information processed by a neuron with per unit of energy consumption, plays an important role in the evolution of neural systems. Here, we calculated the information rates and energy efficiencies of the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron model at different temperatures in a noisy environment. We found that both the information rate and energy efficiency are maximized by certain temperatures. Though the information rate and energy efficiency cannot be maximized simultaneously, the neuron holds a high information processing capacity at the temperature corresponding to maximal energy efficiency. Our results support the idea that the energy efficiency is a selective pressure that influences the evolution of nervous systems.",Human
"A small portion of a tissue defines a microstate in gene expression space. Mutations, epigenetic events or external factors cause microstate displacements which are modeled by combining small independent gene expression variations and large Levy jumps, resulting from the collective variations of a set of genes. The risk of cancer in a tissue is estimated as the microstate probability to transit from the normal to the tumor region in gene expression space. The formula coming from the contribution of large Levy jumps seems to provide a qualitatively correct description of the lifetime risk of cancer, and reveals an interesting connection between the risk and the way the tissue is protected against infections.",Human
"Cell reproduction involves replication of diverse molecule species, in contrast to simple replication system with fewer components. Here, we address why such diversity is sustained despite the efficiency of simple replication systems, using a cell model with catalytic reaction dynamics that grew by uptake of environmental resources. Limited resources led to increased diversity of components within the system, and the number of coexisting species increased with a negative power of the resource abundances. The diversity was explained from the optimum growth speed of the cell, determined by a tradeoff between the utility of diverse resources and the concentration onto fewer components to increase the reaction rate.",Human
"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves with extraordinary rapidity. However, its evolution is constrained by interactions between mutations in its fitness landscape. Here we show that an Ising model describing these interactions, inferred from sequence data obtained prior to the use of antiretroviral drugs, can be used to identify clinically significant sites of resistance mutations. Successful predictions of the resistance sites indicate progress in the development of successful models of real viral evolution at the single residue level, and suggest that our approach may be applied to help design new therapies that are less prone to failure even where resistance data is not yet available.",Human
"Enzymes have been recently found to exhibit enhanced diffusion due to their catalytic activities. A recent experiment [C. Riedel et al., Nature 517, 227 (2015)] has found evidence that suggests this phenomenon might be controlled by the degree of exothermicity of the catalytic reaction involved. Four mechanisms that can lead to this effect, namely, self-thermophoresis, boost in kinetic energy, stochastic swimming, and collective heating, are critically discussed, and it is shown that only the last two could be strong enough to account for the observations. The resulting quantitative description is used to examine the biological significance of the effect.",Human
"Solid-state nanopores are single molecule sensors that measure changes in ionic current as charged polymers such as DNA pass through. Here, we present comprehensive experiments on the length, voltage and salt dependence of the frequency of double-stranded DNA translocations through conical quartz nanopores with mean opening diameter 15 nm. We observe an entropic barrier limited, length dependent translocation frequency at 4M LiCl salt concentration and a drift-dominated, length independent translocation frequency at 1M KCl salt concentration. These observations are described by a unifying convection-diffusion equation which includes the contribution of an entropic barrier for polymer entry.",Human
"Possibilities for using geometry and topology to analyze statistical problems in biology raise a host of novel questions in geometry, probability, algebra, and combinatorics that demonstrate the power of biology to influence the future of pure mathematics. This expository article is a tour through some biological explorations and their mathematical ramifications. The article starts with evolution of novel topological features in wing veins of fruit flies, which are quantified using the algebraic structure of multiparameter persistent homology. The statistical issues involved highlight mathematical implications of sampling from moduli spaces. These lead to geometric probability on stratified spaces, including the sticky phenomenon for Frechet means and the origin of this mathematical area in the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees.",Human
"Gene regulatory circuits must contend with intrinsic noise that arises due to finite numbers of proteins. While some circuits act to reduce this noise, others appear to exploit it. A striking example is the competence circuit in Bacillus subtilis, which exhibits much larger noise in the duration of its competence events than a synthetically constructed analog that performs the same function. Here, using stochastic modeling and fluorescence microscopy, we show that this larger noise allows cells to exit terminal phenotypic states, which expands the range of stress levels to which cells are responsive and leads to phenotypic heterogeneity at the population level. This is an important example of how noise confers a functional benefit in a genetic decision-making circuit.",Human
"We investigate a hybrid PDE/Monte Carlo technique for the variance reduced simulation of an agent-based multiscale model for tumor growth. The variance reduction is achieved by combining a simulation of the stochastic agent-based model on the microscopic scale with a deterministic solution of a simplified (coarse) partial differential equation (PDE) on the macroscopic scale as a control variable. We show that this technique is able to significantly reduce the variance with only the (limited) additional computational cost associated with the deterministic solution of the coarse PDE. We illustrate the performance with numerical experiments in different regimes, both in the avascular and vascular stage of tumor growth.",Human
"The structural flexibility of nucleic acids plays a key role in many fundamental life processes, such as gene replication and expression, DNA-protein recognition, and gene regulation. To obtain a thorough understanding of nucleic acid flexibility, extensive studies have been performed using various experimental methods and theoretical models. In this review, we will introduce the progress that has been made in understanding the flexibility of nucleic acids including DNAs and RNAs, and will emphasize the experimental findings and the effects of salt, temperature, and sequence. Finally, we will discuss the major unanswered questions in understanding the flexibility of nucleic acids.",Human
"A biological system consists of a variety of polymers that are synthesized from monomers, by catalysis that exists only for some long polymers. It is important to elucidate the emergence and sustenance of such autocatalytic polymerization. We analyze here the stochastic polymerization reaction dynamics, to investigate the transition time from a state with almost no catalysts to a state with sufficient catalysts. We found an optimal volume that minimizes this transition time, which agrees with the inverse of the catalyst concentration at the unstable fixed point that separates the two states, as is theoretically explained. Relevance to the origin of life is also discussed.",Human
"Despite the biological importance of non-coding RNA, their structural characterization remains challenging. Making use of the rapidly growing sequence databases, we analyze nucleotide coevolution across homologous sequences via Direct-Coupling Analysis to detect nucleotide-nucleotide contacts. For a representative set of riboswitches, we show that the results of Direct-Coupling Analysis in combination with a generalized Nussinov algorithm systematically improve the results of RNA secondary structure prediction beyond traditional covariance approaches based on mutual information. Even more importantly, we show that the results of Direct-Coupling Analysis are enriched in tertiary structure contacts. By integrating these predictions into molecular modeling tools, systematically improved tertiary structure predictions can be obtained, as compared to using secondary structure information alone.",Human
"Given a system $M$ in a thermal bath we obtain a generalized detailed balance relation for the ratio $r=\pi_\tau(K\to J)/\pi_\tau(J\to K)$ of the transition probabilities $M:J\to K$ and $M:K\to J$ in time $\tau$. We assume an active bath, containing solute molecules in metastable states. These molecules may react with $M$ and the transition $J\to K$ occurs through different channels $\alpha$ involving different reactions with the bath. We find that $r=\sum p^\alpha r^\alpha$, where $p^\alpha$ is the probability that channel $\alpha$ occurs, and $r^\alpha$ depends on the amount of heat (more precisely enthalpy) released to the bath in channel $\alpha$.",Human
"Recent years have witnessed a surge of biological interest in the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem for its relevance to automatic model construction using the distances between data points. Despite the increasing use of MST algorithms for this purpose, the goodness-of-fit of an MST to the data is often elusive because no quantitative criteria have been developed to measure it. Motivated by this, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure that a metric space on n points can be represented by a fully labeled tree on n vertices, and thereby determine when an MST preserves all pairwise distances between points in a finite metric space.",Human
"Base-pockets (non-complementary base-pairs) in a double-stranded DNA play a crucial role in biological processes. Because of thermal fluctuations, it can lower the stability of DNA, whereas, in case of DNA aptamer, small molecules e.g. adenosinemonophosphate(AMP), adenosinetriphosphate(ATP) etc, form additional hydrogen bonds with base-pockets termed as ""binding-pockets"", which enhance the stability. Using the Langevin Dynamics simulations of coarse grained model of DNA followed by atomistic simulations, we investigated the influence of base-pocket and binding-pocket on the stability of DNA aptamer. Striking differences have been reported here for the separation induced by temperature and force, which require further investigation by single molecule experiments.",Human
"How cells reliably infer information about their environment is a fundamentally important question. While sensing and signaling generally start with cell-surface receptors, the degree of accuracy with which a cell can measure external ligand concentration with even the simplest device - a single receptor - is surprisingly hard to pin down. Recent studies provide conflicting results for the fundamental physical limits. Comparison is made difficult as different studies either suggest different readout mechanisms of the ligand-receptor occupancy, or differ on how ligand diffusion is implemented. Here we critically analyse these studies and present a unifying perspective on the limits of sensing, with wide-ranging biological implications.",Human
"Many membrane-bound molecules in cells form small clusters. It has been hypothesized that these clusters convert an analog extracellular signal into a digital intracellular signal and that this conversion increases signaling fidelity. However, the mechanism by which clusters digitize a signal and the subsequent effects on fidelity remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate using a stochastic model of cooperative cluster formation that sufficient cooperation leads to digital signaling. We show that despite reducing the number of output states, which decreases fidelity, digitization also reduces noise in the system, which increases fidelity. The tradeoff between these effects leads to an optimal cluster size that agrees with experimental measurements.",Human
"Discrete and Continuous Dynamics is the first in a series of articles on Network Models for Epidemiology. This project began in the Fall quarter of 2014 in my continuous modeling course. Since then, it has taken off and turned into a series of articles, which I hope to compile into a single report. The purpose of the report is to explore mathematical epidemiology. In this article, we discuss the historical approach to disease modeling with compartmental models. We discuss the issues and benefits of using network models. We build a discrete dynamical system to describe infection and recovery of individuals in the population. Lastly, we detail the computational scheme for iterating this model.",Human
"Successful adaptation helped the emergence of complexity. Alternating plastic- and rigid-like states were recurrently considered to play a role in adaptive processes. However, this extensive knowledge remained fragmented. In this paper I describe plasticity-rigidity cycles as a general adaptation mechanism operating in molecular assemblies, assisted protein folding, cellular differentiation, learning, memory formation, creative thinking, as well as the organization of social groups and ecosystems. Plasticity-rigidity cycles enable a novel understanding of aging, exploration/exploitation trade-off and evolvability, as well as help the design of efficient interventions in medicine and in crisis management of financial and biological ecosystems.",Human
The three dimensional structure of DNA in the nucleus (chromatin) plays an important role in many cellular processes. Recent experimental advances have led to high-throughput methods of capturing information about chromatin conformation on genome-wide scales. New models are needed to quantitatively interpret this data at a global scale. Here we introduce the use of tools from topological data analysis to study chromatin conformation. We use persistent homology to identify and characterize conserved loops and voids in contact map data and identify scales of interaction. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on simulated data and then look data from both a bacterial genome and a human cell line. We identify substantial multiscale topology in these datasets.,Human
"Same-sex sexual behavior is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, but its adaptive origins remain a prominent puzzle. Here I suggest the possibility that same-sex sexual behavior arises as a consequence of the competition between an evolutionary drive for a wide diversity in traits, which improves the adaptability of a species, and a drive for sexual dichotomization of traits, which promotes opposite-sex attraction and increases the rate of reproduction. A simple analytical ""toy model"" is proposed for describing this tradeoff. The model exhibits a number of interesting features, and suggests a simple mathematical form for describing the sexual orientation continuum.",Human
"We present an extensive, systematic study of the Prisoner's Dilemma and Snowdrift games on a square lattice under a synchronous, noiseless imitation dynamics. We show that for both the occupancy of the network and the (random) mobility of the agents there are intermediate values that may increase the amount of cooperators in the system and new phases appear. We analytically determine the transition lines between these phases and compare with the mean field prediction and the observed behavior on a square lattice. We point out which are the more relevant microscopic processes that entitle cooperators to invade a population of defectors in the presence of mobility and discuss the universality of these results.",Human
"We perform a statistical study of the distances between successive occurrencies of a given dinucleotide in the DNA sequence for a number of organisms of different complexity. Our analysis highlights peculiar features of the dinucleotide CG distribution in mammalian DNA, pointing towards a connection with the role of such dinucleotide in DNA methylation. While the CG distributions of mammals exhibit exponential tails with comparable parameters, the picture for the other organisms studied (e.g., fish, insects, bacteria and viruses) is more heterogeneous, possibly because in these organisms DNA methylation has different functional roles. Our analysis suggests that the distribution of the distances between dinucleotides CG provides useful insights in characterizing and classifying organisms in terms of methylation functionalities.",Human
"Population expansions trigger many biomedical and ecological transitions, from tumor growth to invasions of non-native species. Although population spreading often selects for more invasive phenotypes, we show that this outcome is far from inevitable. In cooperative populations, mutations reducing dispersal have a competitive advantage. Such mutations then steadily accumulate at the expansion front bringing invasion to a halt. Our findings are a rare example of evolution driving the population into an unfavorable state and could lead to new strategies to combat unwelcome invaders. In addition, we obtain an exact analytical expression for the fitness advantage of mutants with different dispersal rates.",Human
"The radical-pair mechanism was introduced in the 1960's to explain anomalously large EPR and NMR signals in chemical reactions of organic molecules. It has evolved to the cornerstone of spin chemistry, the study of the effect electron and nuclear spins have on chemical reactions, with the avian magnetic compass mechanism and the photosynthetic reaction center dynamics being prominent biophysical manifestations of such effects. In recent years the radical-pair mechanism was shown to be an ideal biological system where the conceptual tools of quantum information science can be fruitfully applied. We will here review recent work making the case that the radical-pair mechanism is indeed a major driving force of the emerging field of quantum biology.",Human
"We model and simulate the performance of charge-transfer in nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in the CP29 light-harvesting antenna-complex associated with photosystem II (PSII). The model consists of five discrete excitonic energy states and two sinks, responsible for the potentially damaging processes and charge-transfer channels, respectively. We demonstrate that by varying (i) the parameters of the chlorophyll-based dimer, (ii) the resonant properties of the protein-solvent environment interaction, and (iii) the energy transfer rates to the sinks, one can significantly improve the performance of the NPQ. Our analysis suggests strategies for improving the performance of the NPQ in response to environmental changes, and may stimulate experimental verification.",Human
"Locating recombination hotspots in genomic data is an important but difficult task. Current methods frequently rely on estimating complicated models at high computational cost. In this paper we develop an extremely fast, scalable method for inferring recombination hot spots in a population of genomic sequences that is based on the singular value decomposition. Our method performs well in several synthetic data scenarios. We also apply our technique to a real data investigation of the evolution of drug therapy resistance in a population of HIV genomic sequences. Finally, we compare our method both on real and simulated data to a state of the art algorithm.",Human
"Spatial stochastic molecular simulations in biology are limited by the intense computation required to track molecules in space either in a discrete time or discrete space framework, meaning that the serial limit has already been reached in sub-cellular models. This calls for parallel simulations that can take advantage of the power of modern supercomputers; however exact methods are known to be inherently serial. We introduce an operator splitting implementation for irregular grids with a novel method to improve accuracy, and demonstrate potential for scalable parallel simulations in an initial MPI version. We foresee that this groundwork will enable larger scale, whole-cell stochastic simulations in the near future.",Human
"Limited-view artefacts are commonly present in optoacoustic tomography images, mainly due to practical geometrical and physical constraints imposed by the imaging systems as well as limited light penetration into large optically opaque samples. Herein, a new approach termed dynamic particle-enhanced optoacoustic tomography (DPOT) is proposed for improving image contrast and visibility of optoacoustic images under limited-view scenarios. The method is based on the non- linear combination of a temporal sequence of tomographic reconstructions representing sparsely distributed moving particles. We demonstrate experimental performance by dynamically imaging the flow of suspended microspheres in three dimensions, which shows promise for DPOT applicability in angiographic imaging in living organisms.",Human
"We propose a multiscale chemo-mechanical model of cancer tumour development in an epithelial tissue. The model is based on transformation of normal cells into the cancerous state triggered by a local failure of spatial synchronisation of the circadian rhythm. The model includes mechanical interactions and chemical signal exchange between neighbouring cells, as well as division of cells and intercalation, and allows for modification of the respective parameters following transformation into the cancerous state. The numerical simulations reproduce different dephasing patterns - spiral waves and quasistationary clustering, with the latter being conducive to cancer formation. Modification of mechanical properties reproduces distinct behaviour of invasive and localised carcinoma.",Human
"Phase diagram of the ground states of DNA in a bad solvent is studied for a semi-flexible polymer model with a generalized local elastic bending potential characterized by a nonlinearity parameter $x$ and effective self-attraction promoting compaction. $x=1$ corresponds to the worm-like chain model. Surprisingly, the phase diagram as well as the transition lines between the ground states are found to be a function of $x$. The model provides a simple explanation for the results of prior experimental and computational studies and makes predictions for the specific geometries of the ground states. The results underscore the impact of the form of the microscopic bending energy at macroscopic observable scales.",Human
"We study mathematical models describing the evolution of stochastic age-structured populations. After reviewing existing approaches, we present a full kinetic framework for age-structured interacting populations undergoing birth, death and fission processes, in spatially dependent environments. We define the complete probability density for the population-size-age-chart and find results under specific conditions. Connections with more classical models are also explicitly derived. In particular, we show that factorial moments for non-interacting processes are described by a natural generalization of the McKendrick-von Foerster equation, which describes mean-field deterministic behaviour. Our approach utilizes mixed type, multi-dimensional probability distributions similar to those employed in the study of gas kinetics, with terms that satisfy BBGKY-like equation hierarchies.",Human
"We propose a discrete in continuous mathematical model describing the in vitro growth process of biophsy-derived mammalian cardiac progenitor cells growing as clusters in the form of spheres (Cardiospheres). The approach is hybrid: discrete at cellular scale and continuous at molecular level. In the present model cells are subject to the self-organizing collective dynamics mechanism and, additionally, they can proliferate and differentiate, also depending on stochastic processes. The two latter processes are triggered and regulated by chemical signals present in the environment. Numerical simulations show the structure and the development of the clustered progenitors and are in a good agreement with the results obtained from in vitro experiments.",Human
"The low efficiency of commercially-used reverse osmosis (RO) membranes has been the main obstacle in seawater desalination application. Here, we report the auspicious performance, through molecular dynamics simulations, of a seawater desalination filter based on the recently-synthesized graphene-like carbon nitride (g-C2N) [Nat. Commun., 2015, 6, 6486]. Taking advantage of the inherent nanopores and excellent mechanical properties of g-C2N filter, highly efficient seawater desalination can be achieved by modulating the nanopores under tensile strain. The water permeability can be improved by two orders of magnitude compared to RO membranes, which offers a promising approach to the global water shortage solution.",Human
"We present a theoretical analysis of exciton transfer and decoherence effects in a photosynthetic dimer interacting with collective (correlated) and local (uncorrelated) protein-solvent environments. Our approach is based on the framework of the spin-boson model. We derive explicitly the thermal relaxation and decoherence rates of the exciton transfer process, valid for arbitrary temperatures and for arbitrary (in particular, large) interaction constants between the dimer and the environments. We establish a generalization of the Marcus formula, giving reaction rates for dimer levels possibly individually and asymmetrically coupled to environments. We identify rigorously parameter regimes for the validity of the generalized Marcus formula.   The existence of long living quantum coherences at ambient temperatures emerges naturally from our approach.",Human
"Theoretical physics is the search for simple and universal mathematical descriptions of the natural world. In contrast, much of modern biology is an exploration of the complexity and diversity of life. For many, this contrast is prima facie evidence that theory, in the sense that physicists use the word, is impossible in a biological context. For others, this contrast serves to highlight a grand challenge. I'm an optimist, and believe (along with many colleagues) that the time is ripe for the emergence of a more unified theoretical physics of biological systems, building on successes in thinking about particular phenomena. In this essay I try to explain the reasons for my optimism, through a combination of historical and modern examples.",Human
"The importance of collective cellular migration during embryogenesis and tissue repair asks for a sound understanding of underlying principles and mechanisms. Here, we address recent in vitro experiments on cell monolayers which show that the advancement of the leading edge relies on cell proliferation and protrusive activity at the tissue margin. Within a simple viscoelastic mechanical model amenable to detailed analysis, we identify a key parameter responsible for tissue expansion, and we determine the dependence of the monolayer velocity as a function of measurable rheological parameters. Our results allow us to discuss the effects of pharmacological perturbations on the observed tissue dynamics.",Human
"We explore the range of probabilistic behaviours that can be engineered with Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). We show that at steady state CRNs are able to ""program"" any distribution with finite support in $\mathbb{N}^m$, with $m \geq 1$. Moreover, any distribution with countable infinite support can be approximated with arbitrarily small error under the $L^1$ norm. We also give optimized schemes for special distributions, including the uniform distribution. Finally, we formulate a calculus to compute on distributions that is complete for finite support distributions, and can be compiled to a restricted class of CRNs that at steady state realize those distributions.",Human
"The three-dimensional organisation of chromosomes can be probed using methods such as Capture-C. However it is unclear how such population level data relates to the organisation within a single cell, and the mechanisms leading to the observed interactions are still largely obscure. We present a polymer modelling scheme based on the assumption that chromosome architecture is maintained by protein bridges which form chromatin loops. To test the model we perform FISH experiments and also compare with Capture-C data. Starting merely from the locations of protein binding sites, our model accurately predicts the experimentally observed chromatin interactions, revealing a population of 3D conformations.",Human
"Morphological trends in growing colonies of living cells are at the core of physiological and evolutionary processes. Using active gel equations, which include cell division, we show that shape changes during the growth can be regulated by the dynamics of topological defects in the orientation of cells. The friction between the dividing cells and underlying substrate drives anisotropic colony shapes toward more isotropic morphologies, by mediating the number density and velocity of topological defects. We show that the defects interact with the interface at a specific interaction range, set by the vorticity length scale of flows within the colony, and that the cells predominantly reorient parallel to the interface due to division-induced active stresses.",Human
"Understanding protein self-assembly is important for many biological and industrial processes. Proteins can self-assemble into crystals, filaments, gels, and other amorphous aggregates. The final forms include virus capsids and condensed phases associated with diseases, such as amyloid fibrils. Although seemingly different, these assemblies all originate from fundamental protein interactions and are driven by similar thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Here we review recent advances in understanding protein self-assembly through a soft condensed matter perspective with an emphasis on three specific systems: globular proteins, viruses and amyloid fibers. We conclude with a discussion of unanswered questions in the field.",Human
"We propose a model for membrane-cortex adhesion which couples membrane deformations, hydrodynamics and kinetics of membrane-cortex ligands. In its simplest form, the model gives explicit predictions for the critical pressure for membrane detachment and for the value of adhesion energy. We show that these quantities exhibit a significant dependence on the active acto-myosin stresses. The model provides a simple framework to access quantitative information on cortical activity by means of micropipette experiments. We also extend the model to incorporate fluctuations and show that detailed information on the stability of membrane-cortex coupling can be obtained by a combination of micropipette aspiration and fluctuation spectroscopy measurements.",Human
"Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell cancer, is associated with many health challenges, including damage to the kidney by tubulointerstitial fibrosis. We develop a mathematical model which captures the qualitative behavior of the cell and protein populations involved. Specifically, we model the interaction between cells in the proximal tubule of the kidney, free light chains, renal fibroblasts, and myeloma cells. We analyze the model for steady-state solutions to find a mathematically and biologically relevant stable steady-state solution. This foundational model provides a representation of dynamics between key populations in tubulointerstitial fibrosis that demonstrates how these populations interact to affect patient prognosis in patients with MM and renal impairment.",Human
"Aim: Molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analysis are well-established approaches to generate receptor conformational ensembles (RCEs) for ligand docking and virtual screening. Here, we report new fast molecular dynamics-based and normal mode analysis-based protocols combined with conformational pocket classifications to efficiently generate RCEs. Materials \& methods: We assessed our protocols on two well-characterized protein targets showing local active site flexibility, dihydrofolate reductase and large collective movements, CDK2. The performance of the RCEs was validated by distinguishing known ligands of dihydrofolate reductase and CDK2 among a dataset of diverse chemical decoys. Results \& discussion: Our results show that different simulation protocols can be efficient for generation of RCEs depending on different kind of protein flexibility.",Human
"A model of interdependent networks of networks (NoN) has been introduced recently in the context of brain activation to identify the neural collective influencers in the brain NoN. Here we develop a new approach to derive an exact expression for the random percolation transition in Erd\""{o}s-R\'enyi NoN. Analytical calculations are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations and highlight the robustness of the NoN against random node failures. Interestingly, the phase diagram of the model unveils particular patterns of interconnectivity for which the NoN is most vulnerable. Our results help to understand the emergence of robustness in such interdependent architectures.",Human
"We present a method of dimensional reduction for the general Markov model of sequence evolution on a phylogenetic tree. We show that taking certain linear combinations of the associated random variables (site pattern counts) reduces the dimensionality of the model from exponential in the number of extant taxa, to quadratic in the number of taxa, while retaining the ability to statistically identify phylogenetic divergence events. A key feature is the identification of an invariant subspace which depends only bilinearly on the model parameters, in contrast to the usual multi-linear dependence in the full space. We discuss potential applications including the computation of split (edge) weights on phylogenetic trees from observed sequence data.",Human
"Living systems, particularly multicellular systems, often seem hopelessly complex. But recent studies have suggested that beneath this complexity, there may be unifying quantitative principles that we are only now starting to unravel. All cells interact with their environments and with other cells. Communication among cells is a primary means for cells to interact with each other. The complexity of these multicellular systems, due to the large numbers of cells and the diversity of intracellular and intercellular interactions, makes understanding multicellular systems a daunting task. To overcome this challenge, we will likely need judicious simplifications and conceptual frameworks that can reveal design principles that are shared among diverse multicellular systems. Here we review some recent progress towards developing such frameworks.",Human
"Understanding how the brain functions is one of the biggest challenges of our time. The analysis of experimentally recorded neural firing patterns (spike trains) plays a crucial role in addressing this problem. Here, the PySpike library is introduced, a Python package for spike train analysis providing parameter-free and time-scale independent measures of spike train synchrony. It allows to compute similarity and dissimilarity profiles, averaged values and distance matrices. Although mainly focusing on neuroscience, PySpike can also be applied in other contexts like climate research or social sciences. The package is available as Open Source on Github and PyPI.",Human
"We combine traction force data with Bayesian inversion to obtain an absolute estimate of the internal stress field of a cell monolayer. The method, Bayesian inversion stress microscopy (BISM), is validated using numerical simulations performed in a wide range of conditions. It is robust to changes in each ingredient of the underlying statistical model. Importantly, its accuracy does not depend on the rheology of the tissue. We apply BISM to experimental traction force data measured in a narrow ring of cohesive epithelial cells, and check that the inferred stress field coincides with that obtained by direct spatial integration of the traction force data in this quasi-one-dimensional geometry.",Human
"The precision of concentration sensing is improved when cells communicate. Here we derive the physical limits to concentration sensing for cells that communicate over short distances by directly exchanging small molecules (juxtacrine signaling), or over longer distances by secreting and sensing a diffusive messenger molecule (autocrine signaling). In the latter case, we find that the optimal cell spacing can be large, due to a tradeoff between maintaining communication strength and reducing signal cross-correlations. This leads to the surprising result that autocrine signaling allows more precise sensing than juxtacrine signaling for sufficiently large populations. We compare our results to data from a wide variety of communicating cell types.",Human
"Cells may control fluctuations in protein levels by means of negative autoregulation, where transcription factors bind DNA sites to repress their own production. Theoretical studies have assumed a single binding site for the repressor, while in most species it is found that multiple binding sites are arranged in clusters. We study a stochastic description of negative autoregulation with multiple binding sites for the repressor. We find that increasing the number of binding sites induces regular bursting of gene products. By tuning the threshold for repression, we show that multiple binding sites can also suppress fluctuations. Our results highlight possible roles for the presence of multiple binding sites of negative autoregulators.",Human
"We introduce a novel tool for analyzing complex network dynamics, allowing for cascades of causally-related events, which we call causal webs (c-webs), to be separated from other non-causally-related events. This tool shows that traditionally-conceived avalanches may contain mixtures of spatially-distinct but temporally-overlapping cascades of events, and dynamical disorder or noise. In contrast, c-webs separate these components, unveiling previously hidden features of the network and dynamics. We apply our method to mouse cortical data with resulting statistics which demonstrate for the first time that neuronal avalanches are not merely composed of causally-related events.",Human
"Recently, we have proposed a new illness-death model that comprises a state of undiagnosed chronic disease preceding the diagnosed disease. Based on this model, the question arises how case-finding can be assessed in the presence of mortality from all these states. We simulate two scenarios of different performance of case-finding and apply several indices to assess case-finding in both scenarios. One of the prevalence based indices leads to wrong conclusions. Some indices are partly insensitive to distinguish the quality of case-finding. The incidence based indices perform well. If possible, incidence based indices should be preferred.",Human
"Measuring microorganisms in food products is a critical issue for food safety and human health. Although various approaches for detecting low-levels of microorganisms in food have been developed, they require high-cost, complex equipment, invasive procedures, and skilled technicians which limit their widespread use in the food industry. Here, we present a simple, non-destructive, non-contact, and rapid optical method for measuring living microorganisms in meat products using laser speckle decorrelation. By simply measuring dynamic speckle intensity patterns reflected from samples and analyzing the temporal correlation time, the presence of living microorganisms can be non-invasively detected with high sensitivity. We present proof-of-principle demonstrations for detecting E. coli and B. cereus in chicken breast tissues.",Human
"Maximizing the speed and precision of communication while minimizing power dissipation is a fundamental engineering design goal. Also, biological systems achieve remarkable speed, precision and power efficiency using poorly understood physical design principles. Powerful theories like information theory and thermodynamics do not provide general limits on power, precision and speed. Here we go beyond these classical theories to prove that the product of precision and speed is universally bounded by power dissipation in any physical communication channel whose dynamics is faster than that of the signal. Moreover, our derivation involves a novel connection between friction and information geometry. These results may yield insight into both the engineering design of communication devices and the structure and function of biological signaling systems.",Human
"Integrating population genetics into community ecology theory is a major goal in ecology and evolution, but analyzing the resulting models is computationally daunting. Here we describe sPEGG ($\underline{\textrm{s}}\textrm{imulating}$ $\underline{\textrm{P}}\textrm{henotypic}$ $\underline{\textrm{E}}\textrm{volution}$ on $\underline{\textrm{G}}\textrm{eneral Purpose}$ $\underline{\textrm{G}}\textrm{raphics Processing Units}$ (GPGPUs)), an open-source, multi-species forward-time population genetics simulator. Using a single commodity GPGPU instead of a single central processor, we find sPEGG can accelerate eco-evolutionary simulations by a factor of over 200, comparable to performance on a small-to-medium sized computer cluster.",Human
"A kinetic theory is developed for exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases, based on the experimental observation that the rates depend not only on the newly incorporated nucleotide, but also on the previous one, leading to the growth of Markovian DNA sequences from a Bernoullian template. The dependences on nucleotide concentrations and template sequence are explicitly taken into account. In this framework, the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of DNA replication, in particular, the mean growth velocity, the error probability, and the entropy production in terms of the rate constants and the concentrations are calculated analytically. Theory is compared with numerical simulations for the DNA polymerases of T7 viruses and human mitochondria.",Human
The influence of hypertension on low-density lipoproteins intake into the arterial wall is an important factor for understanding mechanisms of atherosclerosis. It has been experimentally observed that the increased pressure leads to the higher level of the LDL inside the wall. In this paper we attempt to construct a model of the LDL transport which reproduces quantitatively experimental outcomes. We supplement the well known four-layer arterial wall model to include two pressure induced effects: the compression of the intima tissue and the increase of the fraction of leaky junctions. We demonstrate that such model can reach the very good agreement with experimental data.,Human
"Traditional approaches to understanding the brain's resilience to neuropathology have identified neurophysiological variables, often described as brain or cognitive 'reserve,' associated with better outcomes. However, mechanisms of function and resilience in large-scale brain networks remain poorly understood. Dynamic network theory may provide a basis for substantive advances in understanding functional resilience in the human brain. In this perspective, we describe recent theoretical approaches from network control theory as a framework for investigating network level mechanisms underlying cognitive function and the dynamics of neuroplasticity in the human brain. We describe the theoretical opportunities offered by the application of network control theory at the level of the human connectome to understand cognitive resilience and inform translational intervention.",Human
"Brillouin microscopy has recently emerged as powerful technique to characterize the mechanical properties of biological tissue, cell and biomaterials. However, the potential of Brillouin microscopy is currently limited to transparent samples, because Brillouin spectrometers do not have sufficient spectral extinction to reject the predominant non-Brillouin scattered light of turbid media. To overcome this issue, we developed a spectrometer composed of a two VIPA stages and a multi-pass Fabry-Perot interferometer. The Fabry-Perot etalon acts as an ultra-narrow band-pass filter for Brillouin light with high spectral extinction and low loss. We report background-free Brillouin spectra from Intralipid solutions and up to 100 microns deep within chicken muscle tissue.",Human
"The flux of visitors through popular places undoubtedly influences viral spreading -- from H1N1 and Zika viruses spreading through physical spaces such as airports, to rumors and ideas spreading though online spaces such as chatrooms and social media. However there is a lack of understanding of the types of viral dynamics that can result. Here we present a minimal dynamical model which focuses on the time-dependent interplay between the {\em mobility through} and the {\em occupancy of} such spaces. Our generic model permits analytic analysis while producing a rich diversity of infection profiles in terms of their shapes, durations, and intensities. The general features of these theoretical profiles compare well to real-world data of recent social contagion phenomena.",Human
"Lipid bilayers forming biological membranes are known to behave as viscous 2D fluids on submicrometer scales; usually they contain a large number of active protein inclusions. Recently, it has been shown [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 112, E3639 (2015)] that such active proteins should in- duce non-thermal fluctuating lipid flows leading to diffusion enhancement and chemotaxis-like drift for passive inclusions in biomembranes. Here, a detailed analytical and numerical investigation of such effects is performed. The attention is focused on the situations when proteins are concentrated within lipid rafts. We demonstrate that passive particles tend to become attracted by active rafts and are accumulated inside them.",Human
"Cells can be considered as systems that utilize changes in thermodynamic entropy as information. Therefore, they serve as useful models for investigating the relationships between entropy production and information transmission, i.e., signal transduction. Based on the hypothesis that cells apply a chemical reaction cascade for the most efficient transduction of information, we adopted a coding design that minimizes the number of bits per concentration of molecules that are employed for information transduction. As a result, the average rate of entropy production is uniform across all cycles in a cascade reaction. Thus, the entropy production rate can be a valuable measure for the quantification of intracellular signal transduction.",Human
"This paper theoretically analyzes a phenomenological stochastic model for bacterial growth. This model comprises cell division and the linear growth of cells, where growth rates and cell cycles are drawn from lognormal distributions. We find that the cell size is expressed as a sum of independent lognormal variables. We show numerically that the quality of the lognormal approximation greatly depends on the distributions of the growth rate and cell cycle. Furthermore, we show that actual parameters of the growth rate and cell cycle take values that give a good lognormal approximation; thus, the experimental cell-size distribution is in good agreement with a lognormal distribution.",Human
"By employing a series of massively parallel ab-initio simulations, we study how optical forces act on biological matter subject to morphological disease. As a representative case study, we here consider the case of Plasmodium Falciparum on red blood cells (RBC) illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave. Realistic parameters for the geometry and the refractive index are then taken from published experiments. In our theoretical campaign, we study the dependence of the optical force on the disease stage for different incident wavelengths. We show that optical forces change significantly with the disease, with amplitude variation in the hundreds of pN range. Our results open up new avenues for the design of new optical systems for the treatment of human disease.",Human
"Gene co-expression network differential analysis is designed to help biologists understand gene expression patterns under different condition. By comparing different gene co-expression networks we may find conserved part as well as condition specific set of genes. Taking the network as a collection as modules, we use a sample-saving method to construct condition-specific gene co-expression network, and identify differentially expressed subnetworks as conserved or condition specific modules which may be associated with biological processes. We have implemented the method as an R package which establishes a pipeline from expression profile to biological explanations. The usefulness of the method is also demonstrated by synthetic data as well as Daphnia magna gene expression data under different environmental stresses.",Human
"In spite of the large amount of existing neural models in the literature, there is a lack of a systematic review of the possible effect of choosing different initial conditions on the dynamic evolution of neural systems. In this short review we intend to give insights into this topic by discussing some published examples. First, we briefly introduce the different ingredients of a neural dynamical model. Secondly, we introduce some concepts used to describe the dynamic behavior of neural models, namely phase space and its portraits, time series, spectra, multistability and bifurcations. We end with an analysis of the irreversibility of processes and its implications on the functioning of normal and pathological brains.",Human
"A genome-scale reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon 2, is available but no interface exists to interactively visualise its content integrated with omics data and simulation results. We manually drew a comprehensive map, ReconMap 2.0, that is consistent with the content of Recon 2. We present it within a web interface that allows content query, visualization of custom datasets and submission of feedback to manual curators. ReconMap can be accessed via http://vmh.uni.lu, with network export in a Systems Biology Graphical Notation compliant format. A Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) Toolbox extension to interact with ReconMap is available via https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox.",Human
"The dynamical organization of membrane-bound organelles along intracellular transport pathways relies on vesicular exchange between organelles and on biochemical maturation of the organelle content by specific enzymes. The relative importance of each mechanism in controlling organelle dynamics remains controversial, in particular for transport through the Golgi apparatus. Using a stochastic model, we show that full maturation of membrane-bound compartments can be seen as the stochastic escape from a steady-state in which export is dominated by vesicular exchange. We show that full maturation can contribute a significant fraction of the total out-flux for small organelles such as endosomes and Golgi cisternae.",Human
"We present a generalized Landau-Brazovskii theory for the solidification of chiral molecules on a spherical surface. With increasing sphere radius one encounters first intervals where robust achiral density modulations appear with icosahedral symmetry via first-order transitions. Next, one en- counters intervals where fragile but stable icosahedral structures still can be constructed but only by superposition of multiple irreducible representations. Chiral icoshedral structures appear via continuous or very weakly first-order transitions. Outside these parameter intervals, icosahedral symmetry is broken along a three-fold axis or a five-fold axis. The predictions of the theory are compared with recent numerical simulations.",Human
"Escherichia coli swims using flagella activated by rotary motors. The direction of rotation of the motors is indirectly regulated by the binding of a single messenger protein. The conformational spread model has been shown to accurately describe the equilibrium properties as well as the dynamics of the flagellar motor. In this paper we study this model from an analytic point of view. By exploiting the separation of timescales observed in experiments, we show how to reduce the conformational spread model to a coarse-grained, cooperative binding model. We show that this simplified model reproduces very well the dynamics of the motor switch.",Human
"After the discovery of laser therapy it was realized it has useful application of wound healing and reduce pain, but due to the poor understanding of the mechanism and dose response this technique remained to be controversial for therapeutic applications. In order to understand the working and effectiveness different experiments were performed to determine the laser beam effect at the cellular and tissue level. This article discusses the mechanism of beam interaction at tissues and cellular level with different light sources and dosimetry principles for clinical application of low level laser therapy. Different application techniques and methods currently in use for clinical treatment has also been reviewed.",Human
"Recent efforts to survey the numerous softwares available to perform single molecule tracking (SMT) highlighted a significant dependence of the outcomes on the specific method used, and the limitation encountered by most techniques to capture fast movements in a crowded environment. Other approaches to identify the mode and rapidity of motion of fluorescently labeled biomolecules, that do not relay on the localization and linking of the images of isolated single molecules are, however, available.This direct comparison shows that correlative imaging analysis approaches complement effectively current SMT methods in circumstances when, due to either the density of the sample, the low signal to noise ratio or molecular blinking, trajectory linking does not allow to capture long-range or fast motion.",Human
"Dense active matter, from bacterial suspensions and microtubule bundles driven by motor proteins to cellular monolayers and synthetic Janus particles, is characterised by mesoscale turbulence, the emergence of chaotic flow structures. By immersing an ordered array of symmetric rotors in an active fluid, we introduce a microfluidic system that exploits spontaneous symmetry breaking in mesoscale turbulence to generate work. The lattice of rotors self-organises into a spin-state where neighbouring discs continuously rotate in permanent alternating directions due to combined hydrodynamic and elastic effects. Our virtual prototype demonstrates a new research direction for the design of micromachines powered by the nematohydrodynamic properties of active turbulence.",Human
"In this paper we study properties of topological RNA structures, i.e.~RNA contact structures with cross-serial interactions that are filtered by their topological genus. RNA secondary structures within this framework are topological structures having genus zero. We derive a new bivariate generating function whose singular expansion allows us to analyze the distributions of arcs, stacks, hairpin- , interior- and multi-loops. We then extend this analysis to H-type pseudoknots, kissing hairpins as well as $3$-knots and compute their respective expectation values. Finally we discuss our results and put them into context with data obtained by uniform sampling structures of fixed genus.",Human
"For many types of learning, spaced training that involves repeated long inter-trial intervals (ITIs) leads to more robust memory formation than does massed training that involves short or no intervals. Several cognitive theories have been proposed to explain this superiority, but only recently has data begun to delineate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of spaced training. We review these theories and data here. Computational models of the implicated signaling cascades have predicted that spaced training with irregular ITIs can enhance learning. This strategy of using models to predict optimal spaced training protocols, combined with pharmacotherapy, suggests novel ways to rescue impaired synaptic plasticity and learning.",Human
"We consider a sparse random network of excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with short-term synaptic depression. Furthermore to mimic the dynamics of a brain circuit in its first stages of development we introduce for each neuron correlations among in-degree and out-degree as well as among excitability and the corresponding total degree, We analyze the influence of single neuron stimulation and deletion on the collective dynamics of the network. We show the existence of a small group of neurons capable of controlling and even silencing the bursting activity of the network. These neurons form a functional clique since only their activation in a precise order and within specific time windows is capable to ignite population bursts.",Human
The dynamic interplay between collective cell movement and the various molecules involved in the accompanying cell signalling mechanisms plays a crucial role in many biological processes including normal tissue development and pathological scenarios such as wound healing and cancer. Information about the various structures embedded within these processes allows a detailed exploration of the binding of molecular species to cell-surface receptors within the evolving cell population. In this paper we establish a general spatio-temporal-structural framework that enables the description of molecular binding to cell membranes coupled with the cell population dynamics. We first provide a general theoretical description for this approach and then illustrate it with two examples arising from cancer invasion.,Human
"Guided movement in response to slowly diffusing polymeric trails provides a unique mechanism for self-organization of some microorganisms. To elucidate how this signaling route leads to microcolony formation, we experimentally probe the trajectory and orientation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that propel themselves on a surface using type IV pili motility appendages, which preferentially attach to deposited exopolysaccharides. We construct a stochastic model by analyzing single-bacterium trajectories, and show that the resulting theoretical prediction for the many-body behavior of the bacteria is in quantitative agreement with our experimental characterization of how cells explore the surface via a power law strategy.",Human
"Protein molecules in cells are synthesized by macromolecular machines called ribosomes. According to recent experimental data, we reduce the complexity of the ribosome and propose a model to express its activity in six main states. Using our model, we study the translation rate in different biological relevant situations in the presence of external force, and translation through the RNA double stranded region in the absence or presence of the external force. In the present study, we give a quantitative theory for translation rate and show that the ribosome behaves more like a Brownian Ratchet motor. Our findings could shed some light on understanding behaviors of the ribosome in biological conditions.",Human
"We demonstrate an electrolyte-gated hybrid nanoparticle/organic synapstor (synapse-transistor, termed EGOS) that exhibits short-term plasticity as biological synapses. The response of EGOS makes it suitable to be interfaced with neurons: short-term plasticity is observed at spike voltage as low as 50 mV (in a par with the amplitude of action potential in neurons) and with a typical response time in the range of tens milliseconds. Human neuroblastoma stem cells are adhered and differentiated into neurons on top of EGOS. We observe that the presence of the cells does not alter short-term plasticity of the device.",Human
"We use a three-bead-spring model to investigate the dynamics of bi-flagellate micro-swimmers near a surface. While the primary dynamics and scattering are governed by geometric-dependent direct contact, the fluid flows generated by the swimmer locomotion are important in orienting it toward or away from the surface. Flagellar noise and in particular cell spinning about the main axis help a surface-trapped swimmer escape, whereas the time a swimmer spends at the surface depends on the incident angle. The dynamics results from a nuanced interplay of direct collisions, hydrodynamics, noise and the swimmer geometry. We show that to correctly capture the dynamics of a biflagellate swimmer, minimal models need to resolve the shape asymmetry.",Human
"The lengths of the telomere regions of chromosomes in a population of cells are modelled using a chemical master equation formalism, from which the evolution of the average number of cells of each telomere length is extracted. In particular, the role of the telomere-elongating enzyme telomerase on these dynamics is investigated. We show that for biologically relevant rates of cell birth and death, one finds a critical rate, R_crit, of telomerase activity such that the total number of cells diverges. Further, R_crit is similar in magnitude to the rates of mitosis and cell death. The possible relationship of this result to replicative immortality and its associated hallmark of cancer is discussed.",Human
"The computational modelling of DNA is becoming crucial in light of new advances in DNA nanotechnology, single-molecule experiments and in vivo DNA tampering. Here we present a mesoscopic model for double stranded DNA (dsDNA) at the single nucleotide level which retains the characteristic helical structure, while being able to simulate large molecules -- up to a million base pairs -- for time-scales which are relevant to physiological processes. This is made possible by an efficient and highly-parallelised implementation of the model which we discuss here. We compare the behaviour of our model with single molecule experiments where dsDNA is manipulated by external forces or torques. We also present some results on the kinetics of denaturation of linear DNA.",Human
"Akin to electric circuits, we construct biocircuits that are manipulated by cutting and assembling channels through which stochastic information flows. This diagrammatic manipulation allows us to create a method which constructs networks by joining building blocks selected so that (a) they cover only basic processes; (b) it is scalable to large networks; (c) the mean and variance-covariance from the Pauli master equation form a closed system and; (d) given the initial probability distribution, no special boundary conditions are necessary to solve the master equation. The method aims to help with both designing new synthetic signalling pathways and quantifying naturally existing regulatory networks.",Human
"Recent electrophysiological experiments have shown that dopamine (D1) modulation of pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex reduces spike frequency adaptation and enhances NMDA transmission. Using four models, from multicompartmental to integrate and fire, we examine the effects of these modulations on sustained (delay) activity in a reverberatory network. We find that D1 modulation may enable robust network bistability yielding selective reverberation among cells that code for a particular item or location. We further show that the tuning curve of such cells is sharpened, and that signal-to-noise ratio is increased. We postulate that D1 modulation affects the tuning of ""memory fields"" and yield efficient distributed dynamic representations.",Human
"Empirical observations in marine ecosystems have suggested a balance of biological and advection time scales as a possible explanation of species coexistence. To characterise this scenario, we measure the time to fixation in neutrally evolving populations in chaotic flows. Contrary to intuition the variation of time scales does not interpolate straightforwardly between the no-flow and well-mixed limits; instead we find that fixation is the slowest at intermediate Damk\""ohler numbers, indicating long-lasting coexistence of species. Our analysis shows that this slowdown is due to spatial organisation on an increasingly modularised network. We also find that diffusion can either slow down or speed up fixation, depending on the relative time scales of flow and evolution.",Human
"A central challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neural system implements computation through its dynamics. We propose a nonlinear time series model aimed at characterizing interpretable dynamics from neural trajectories. Our model assumes low-dimensional continuous dynamics in a finite volume. It incorporates a prior assumption about globally contractional dynamics to avoid overly enthusiastic extrapolation outside of the support of observed trajectories. We show that our model can recover qualitative features of the phase portrait such as attractors, slow points, and bifurcations, while also producing reliable long-term future predictions in a variety of dynamical models and in real neural data.",Human
"Multicellular migration and pattern formation play important roles in developmental biology, cancer metastasis and wound healing. To understand the collective cell dynamics in three dimensional extracellular matrix (ECM), we have developed a simple and mechanical-based strategy, Diskoid In Geometrically Micropatterned ECM (DIGME). DIGME allows easy engineering of the shape of 3-D tissue organoid, the mesoscale ECM heterogeneity, and the fiber alignment of collagen-based ECM all at the same time. We have employed DIGME to study the collective cancer invasion and find that DIGME provides a powerful tool to probe three dimensional dynamics of tumor organoid in patterned microenvironment.",Human
"Standard neutral population genetics theory with a strictly fixed population size has important limitations. An alternative model that allows independently fluctuating population sizes and reproduces the standard neutral evolution is reviewed. We then study a situation such that the competing species are neutral at the equilibrium population size but population size fluctuations nevertheless favor fixation of one species over the other. In this case, a separation of timescales emerges naturally and allows adiabatic elimination of a fast population size variable to deduce the fluctuations-induced selection dynamics near the equilibrium population size. The results highlight the incompleteness of the standard population genetics with a strictly fixed population size.",Human
"Progress in high-resolution x-ray microtomography has provided us with a practical approach to determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of opaque samples at micrometer to submicrometer resolution. In this review, we give an introduction to hard x-ray microtomography and its application to the visualization of 3D structures of biological soft tissues. Practical aspects of sample preparation, handling, data collection, 3D reconstruction, and structure analysis are described. Furthermore, different sample contrasting methods are approached in detail. Examples of microtomographic studies are overviewed to present an outline of biological applications of x-ray microtomography. We also provide perspectives of biological microtomography as the convergence of sciences in x-ray optics, biology, and structural analysis.",Human
"Septins are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are conserved from fungi to humans. Septins assemble into heterooligomeric complexes and higher-order structures with key roles in various cellular functions including cell migration and division. The mechanisms by which septins assemble and interact with other cytoskeletal elements like actin remain elusive. A powerful approach to address this question is by cell-free reconstitution of pu- rified cytoskeletal proteins combined with fluorescence microscopy. Here, we describe procedures for the purification of recombinant Drosophila and human septin hexamers from Escherichia coli and reconstitution of actin-septin coassembly. These procedures can be used to compare assembly of Drosophila and human septins and their coassembly with the actin cytoskeleton by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.",Human
"Humans face the task of balancing dynamic systems near an unstable equilibrium repeatedly throughout their lives. Much research has been aimed at understanding the mechanisms of intermittent control in the context of human balance control. The present paper deals with one of the recent developments in the theory of human intermittent control, namely, the double-well model of noise-driven control activation. We demonstrate that the double-well model can reproduce the whole range of experimentally observed distributions under different conditions. Moreover, we show that a slight change in the noise intensity parameter leads to a sudden shift of the action point distribution shape, that is, a phase transition is observed.",Human
"Protein binding often involves conformational changes. Important questions are whether a conformational change occurs prior to a binding event ('conformational selection') or after a binding event ('induced fit'), and how conformational transition rates can be obtained from experiments. In this article, we present general results for the chemical relaxation rates of conformational-selection and induced-fit binding processes that hold for all concentrations of proteins and ligands and, thus, go beyond the standard pseudo-first-order approximation of large ligand concentration. These results allow to distinguish conformational-selection from induced-fit processes - also in cases in which such a distinction is not possible under pseudo-first-order conditions - and to extract conformational transition rates of proteins from chemical relaxation data.",Human
"Networks of contacts capable of spreading infectious diseases are often observed to be highly heterogeneous, with the majority of individuals having fewer contacts than the mean, and a significant minority having relatively very many contacts. We derive a two-dimensional diffusion model for the full temporal behavior of the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model on such a network, by making use of a time-scale separation in the deterministic limit of the dynamics. This low-dimensional process is an accurate approximation to the full model in the limit of large populations, even for cases when the time-scale separation is not too pronounced, provided the maximum degree is not of the order of the population size.",Human
"The susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) agent-based model is usually employed in the investigation of epidemics. The model describes a Markov process for a single communicable disease among susceptible (S) and infected (I) agents. However, the disease spreading forecasting is often restricted to numerical simulations, while analytic formulations lack both general results and perturbative approaches since they are subjected to asymmetric time generators. Here, we discuss perturbation theory, approximations and application of many-body techniques in epidemic models in the framework for squared norm of probability vector $|P(t)| ^2$, in which asymmetric time generators are replaced by their symmetric counterparts.",Human
"The upper motor neuron dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was quantified using triple stimulation and more focal transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques that were developed to reduce recording variability. These measurements were combined with clinical and neurophysiological data to develop a novel random forest based supervised machine learning prediction model. This model was capable of predicting cross-sectional ALS disease severity as measured by the ALSFRSr scale with 97% overall accuracy and 99% precision. The machine learning model developed in this research provides a new, unique and objective diagnostic method for quantifying disease severity and identifying subtle changes in disease progression in ALS.",Human
"Recent genome and transcriptome sequencing projects have unveiled a plethora of highly structured RNA molecules as central mediators of cellular function. Single molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) is a powerful tool for analyzing the temporal evolution of the global structure of individual RNA molecules, in pursuit of understanding their essential structure-dynamics-function relationships. In contrast to enzymatic and chemical footprinting, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, smFRET yields temporally resolved, quantitative information about single molecules rather than only time and ensemble averages of entire populations. This enables unique observations of transient and rare conformations under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions.",Human
"Inferring strength and direction of interactions from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings is of crucial importance to improve our understanding of dynamical interdependencies underlying various physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions in the human epileptic brain. We here use approaches from symbolic analysis to investigate---in a time-resolved manner---weighted and directed, short- to long-ranged interactions between various brain regions constituting the epileptic network. Our observations point to complex spatial-temporal interdependencies underlying the epileptic process and their role in the generation of epileptic seizures, despite the massive reduction of the complex information content of multi-day, multi-channel EEG recordings through symbolisation. We discuss limitations and potential future improvements of this approach.",Human
"In this note, we develop semi-analytical techniques to obtain the full correlational structure of a stochastic network of nonlinear neurons described by rate variables. Under the assumption that pairs of membrane potentials are jointly Gaussian -- which they tend to be in large networks -- we obtain deterministic equations for the temporal evolution of the mean firing rates and the noise covariance matrix that can be solved straightforwardly given the network connectivity. We also obtain spike count statistics such as Fano factors and pairwise correlations, assuming doubly-stochastic action potential firing. Importantly, our theory does not require fluctuations to be small, and works for several biologically motivated, convex single-neuron nonlinearities.",Human
"Reliable in-silico design of synthetic gene networks necessitates novel approaches to model the process of protein synthesis under the influence of limited resources. We present such a novel protein synthesis model which originates from the Ribosome Flow Model and among other things describes the movement of RNA-polymerase and Ribosomes on mRNA and DNA templates respectively. By analyzing the convergence properties of this model based upon geometric considerations we present additional insights into the dynamic mechanisms of the process of protein synthesis. Further, we exemplarily show how this model can be used to evaluate the performance of synthetic gene circuits under different loading scenarios.",Human
"The response properties of excitable systems driven by colored noise are of great interest, but are usually mathematically only accessible via approximations. For this reason, dichotomous noise, a rare example of a colored noise leading often to analytically tractable problems, has been extensively used in the study of stochastic systems. Here, we calculate exact expressions for the power spectrum and the susceptibility of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron driven by asymmetric dichotomous noise. While our results are in excellent agreement with simulations, they also highlight a limitation of using dichotomous noise as a simple model for more complex fluctuations: Both power spectrum and susceptibility exhibit an undamped periodic structure, the origin of which we discuss in detail.",Human
"Real food web data available in the literature presents us with the relations between various species, sizes of these species, metabolic types of the species and other useful information, which allows us to define parameters for the mathematical dynamical models of these food webs, and perform theoretical studies of these models. Unfortunately, the researches often face the problem of the extinction of the species in such situations, which could be an important limiting factor. In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm of parameterisation that leads to the existence of positive steady state and improves persistence of the species in multi-species models of real food webs.",Human
"In this study, spatial stochastic and logistic model (SSLM) describing dynamics of a population of a certain species was analysed. The behaviour of the extinction threshold as a function of model parameters was studied. More specifically, we studied how the critical values for the model parameters that separate the cases of extinction and persistence depend on the spatial scales of the competition and dispersal kernels. We compared the simulations and analytical results to examine if and how the mathematical approximations break down at the vicinity of the extinction threshold, and found a functional form of the naive approximation for which higher-order term of analytical approximation converges.",Human
"Motivated by single-molecule experiments on synaptic membrane protein domains, we use a stochastic lattice model to study protein reaction and diffusion processes in crowded membranes. We find that the stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic proteins provide a simple physical mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the molecular turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the single-molecule trajectories observed for synaptic proteins, and spatially inhomogeneous protein lifetimes at the cell membrane. Our results suggest that central aspects of the single-molecule and collective dynamics observed for membrane protein domains can be understood in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes at the cell membrane.",Human
"In recent experiments [T. Basta et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 111, 670 (2014)] lipids and membrane proteins were observed to self-assemble into membrane protein polyhedral nanoparticles (MPPNs) with a well-defined polyhedral protein arrangement and characteristic size. We develop a model of MPPN self-assembly in which the preferred symmetry and size of MPPNs emerge from the interplay of protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, topological defects in protein packing, and thermal effects. With all model parameters determined directly from experiments, our model correctly predicts the observed symmetry and size of MPPNs. Our model suggests how key lipid and protein properties can be modified to produce a range of MPPN symmetries and sizes in experiments.",Human
"Mapping gene expression as a quantitative trait using whole genome-sequencing and transcriptome analysis allows to discover the functional consequences of genetic variation. We developed a novel method and ultra-fast software Findr for higly accurate causal inference between gene expression traits using cis-regulatory DNA variations as causal anchors, which improves current methods by taking into account hidden confounders and weak regulations. Findr outperformed existing methods on the DREAM5 Systems Genetics challenge and on the prediction of microRNA and transcription factor targets in human lymphoblastoid cells, while being nearly a million times faster. Findr is publicly available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr",Human
"We present a new statistical method to analyze multichannel steady-state local field potentials (LFP) recorded within different sensory cortices of different rodent species. Our spatiotemporal multi-dimensional cluster statistics (MCS) method enables statistical analyzing and comparing clusters of data points in n-dimensional space. We demonstrate that using this approach stimulus-specific attractor-like spatiotemporal activity patterns can be detected and be significantly different from each other during stimulation with long-lasting stimuli. Our method may be applied to other types of multichannel neuronal data, like EEG, MEG or spiking responses and used for the development of new read-out algorithms of brain activity and by that opens new perspectives for the development of brain-computer interfaces.",Human
"Alloreactivity following stem cell transplantation (SCT) is difficult to predict in patients undergoing transplantation from HLA matched donors. In this study we performed whole exome sequencing of SCT donor-recipient pairs (DRP). This allowed determination of entire library of alloreactive peptide sequences which would bind HLA class I molecules in each DRP. Utilizing the HLA binding affinity (IC50) and tissue expression levels of the parent proteins, an aggregate donor T cell response to the recipient alloreactive peptides was calculated using a vector-operator dynamical system model. Marked variability in the simulated CD8+ T cell responses was observed in all the donor recipient pairs.",Human
"Self-assembly of protein monomers into distinct membrane protein oligomers provides a general mechanism for diversity in the molecular architectures, and resulting biological functions, of membrane proteins. We develop a general physical framework describing the thermodynamic competition between different oligomeric states of membrane proteins. Using the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance as a model system, we show how the dominant oligomeric states of membrane proteins emerge from the interplay of protein concentration in the cell membrane, protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, and direct monomer-monomer interactions. Our results suggest general physical mechanisms and principles underlying regulation of protein function via control of membrane protein oligomeric state.",Human
"We present a novel illumination control technique for optical diffraction tomography (ODT). Various spatial frequencies of beam illumination were controlled by displaying time-averaged sinusoidal patterns using a digital micromirror device (DMD). Compared to the previous method using binary Lee holograms, the present method eliminates unwanted diffracted beams which may deteriorate the image quality of the ODT. We demonstrated the capability of the present method by reconstructing three-dimensional refractive index (RI) distributions of various samples, with high RI sensitivity (\sigma_\Delta n = 3.15 +/- 10-4), and reconstructing 3-D RI tomograms of biological samples, which provided quantitative biochemical and morphological information about the samples.",Human
"Compartments are ubiquitous throughout biology, yet their importance stretches back to the origin of cells. In the context of origin of life, we assume that a protocell, a compartment enclosing functional components, requires $N$ components to be evolvable. We take interest in the timescale in which a minimal evolvable protocell is produced. We show that when protocells fuse and share information, the time to produce an evolvable protocell scales algebraically in $N$, in contrast to an exponential scaling in the absence of fusion. We discuss the implications of this result for origins of life, as well as other biological processes.",Human
"In a previous paper, we examined a class of possible conformations for helically patterned filaments in contact with a bonding surface. In particular, we investigated geometries where contact between the pattern and the surface was improved through a periodic twisting and lifting of the filament. A consequence of this lifting is that the total length of the filament projected onto the surface decreases after bonding. When the bonding character of the surface is actuated, this phenomenon can lead to both lifelike ""inchworm"" behavior of the filaments and ensemble movement. We illustrate, through simulation, how pattern formation may be achieved through this mechanism.",Human
"Transparent tissue scaffolds enable illumination of growing tissue to accelerate cell proliferation and improve other cell functions through photobiomodulation. The biphasic dose response of cells exposed to photobiomodulating light dictates that the illumination to be evenly distributed across the scaffold such that the cells are neither under nor over exposed to light. However, equalized illumination has not been sufficiently addressed. Here we analyze and experimentally demonstrate spatially equalizing illumination by three methods, namely, engineered surface scattering, reflection by a gold mirror, and traveling-waves in a ring mesh. Our results show that nearly equalized illumination is achievable by controlling the light scattering-to-loss ratio. This demonstration opens opportunities for dose-optimized photobiomodulation in tissue regeneration.",Human
"Using a microfluidic trap, we study the behavior of individual phospholipid vesicles in contact with fatty acids. We show that spontaneous fatty acids insertion inside the bilayer is controlled by the vesicle size, osmotic pressure difference across the membrane and fatty acids concentration in the external bath. Depending on these parameters, vesicles can grow spherically or become unstable and fragment into several daughter vesicles. We establish the phase diagram for vesicle growth and we derive a simple thermodynamic model that reproduces the time evolution of the vesicle volume. Finally, we show that stable growth can be achieved on an artificial cell expressing a simple set of bacterial cytoskeletal proteins, paving the way toward artificial cell reproduction.",Human
"We introduce and analyze a model for osmotically spreading biofilm colonies at solid-air interfaces that includes wetting phenomena, i.e. surface forces. The model combines a hydrodynamic description for biologically passive liquid suspensions with bioactive processes. We show that wetting effects are responsible for a transition between persistent and arrested spreading and provide experimental evidence for the existence of this transition for Bacillus subtilis biofilms growing on agar substrates. In the case of arrested spreading, the biofilm is non-invasive albeit being biologically active. However, a small reduction in the surface tension of the biofilm is sufficient to induce spreading.",Human
"Combinatorial analysis of a certain abstract of RNA structures has been studied to investigate their statistics. Our approach regards the backbone of secondary structures as an alternate sequence of paired and unpaired sets of nucleotides, which can be described by random matrix model. We obtain the generating function of the structures using Hermitian matrix model with Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind and analyze the statistics with respect to the number of stems. To match the experimental findings of the statistical behavior, we consider the structures in a grand canonical ensemble and find a fugacity value corresponding to an appropriate number of stems.",Human
"We investigate the behavior of a model neuron that receives a biophysically-realistic noisy post-synaptic current based on uncorrelated spiking activity from a large number of afferents. We show that, with static synapses, such noise can give rise to inverse stochastic resonance (ISR) as a function of the presynaptic firing rate. We compare this to the case with dynamic synapses that feature short-term synaptic plasticity, and show that the interval of presynaptic firing rate over which ISR exists can be extended or diminished. We consider both short-term depression and facilitation. Interestingly, we find that a double inverse stochastic resonance (DISR), with two distinct wells centered at different presynaptic firing rates, can appear.",Human
"100 years after Smoluchowski introduces his approach to stochastic processes, they are now at the basis of mathematical and physical modeling in cellular biology: they are used for example to analyse and to extract features from large number (tens of thousands) of single molecular trajectories or to study the diffusive motion of molecules, proteins or receptors. Stochastic modeling is a new step in large data analysis that serves extracting cell biology concepts. We review here the Smoluchowski's approach to stochastic processes and provide several applications for coarse-graining diffusion, studying polymer models for understanding nuclear organization and finally, we discuss the stochastic jump dynamics of telomeres across cell division and stochastic gene regulation.",Human
"Despite the obvious advantage of simple life forms capable of fast replication, different levels of cognitive complexity have been achieved by living systems in terms of their potential to cope with environmental uncertainty. Against the inevitable cost associated to detecting environmental cues and responding to them in adaptive ways, we conjecture that the potential for predicting the environment can overcome the expenses associated to maintaining costly, complex structures. We present a minimal formal model grounded in information theory and selection, in which successive generations of agents are mapped into transmitters and receivers of a coded message. Our agents are guessing machines and their capacity to deal with environments of different complexity defines the conditions to sustain more complex agents.",Human
"Catalytic swimmers have attracted much attention as alternatives to biological systems for examining collective microscopic dynamics and the response to physico-chemical signals. Yet, understanding and predicting even the most fundamental characteristics of their individual propulsion still raises important challenges. While chemical asymmetry is widely recognized as the cornerstone of catalytic propulsion, different experimental studies have reported that particles with identical chemical properties may propel in opposite directions. Here, we show that, beyond its chemical properties, the detailed shape of a catalytic swimmer plays an essential role in determining its direction of motion, demonstrating the compatibility of the classical theoretical framework with experimental observations.",Human
"Although redistribution of red blood cells at bifurcated vessels is highly dependent on flow rate, it is still challenging to quantitatively express the dependency of flow rate in plasma skimming due to nonlinear cellular interactions. We suggest a plasma skimming model that can involve the effect of fractional blood flow at each bifurcation point. For validating the new model, it is compared with \textit{in vivo} data at single bifurcation points, as well as microvascular network systems. In the simulation results, the exponential decay of plasma skimming parameter, $M$, along fractional flow rate shows the best performance in both cases.",Human
"This paper presents a monotonicity-based spatiotemporal conductivity imaging method for continuous regional lung monitoring using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The EIT data (i.e., the boundary current-voltage data) can be decomposed into pulmonary, cardiac and other parts using their different periodic natures. The time-differential current-voltage operator corresponding to the lung ventilation can be viewed as either semi-positive or semi-negative definite owing to monotonic conductivity changes within the lung regions. We used this monotonicity constraints to improve the quality of lung EIT imaging. We tested the proposed methods in numerical simulations, phantom experiments and human experiments.",Human
"We investigate the geometrical and mechanical properties of adherent cells characterized by a highly anisotropic actin cytoskeleton. Using a combination of theoretical work and experiments on micropillar arrays, we demonstrate that the shape of the cell edge is accurately described by elliptical arcs, whose eccentricity expresses the degree of anisotropy of the internal cell stresses. This results in a spatially varying tension along the cell edge, that significantly affects the traction forces exerted by the cell on the substrate. Our work highlights the strong interplay between cell mechanics and geometry and paves the way towards the reconstruction of cellular forces from geometrical data.",Human
"Finding the origin of slow and infra-slow oscillations could reveal or explain brain mechanisms in health and disease. Here, we present a biophysically constrained computational model of a neural network where the inclusion of astrocytes introduced slow and infra-slow-oscillations, through two distinct mechanisms. Specifically, we show how astrocytes can modulate the fast network activity through their slow inter-cellular calcium wave speed and amplitude and possibly cause the oscillatory imbalances observed in diseases commonly known for such abnormalities, namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, depression and ischemic stroke. This work aims to increase our knowledge on how astrocytes and neurons synergize to affect brain function and dysfunction.",Human
"This paper investigates cells proliferation dynamics in small tumor cell aggregates using an individual based model (IBM). The simulation model is designed to study the morphology of the cell population and of the cell lineages as well as the impact of the orientation of the division plane on this morphology. Our IBM model is based on the hypothesis that cells are incompressible objects that grow in size and divide once a threshold size is reached, and that newly born cell adhere to the existing cell cluster. We performed comparisons between the simulation model and experimental data by using several statistical indicators. The results suggest that the emergence of particular morphologies can be explained by simple mechanical interactions.",Human
Advances in time resolved spectroscopy have provided new insight into the energy transmission in natural photosynthetic complexes. Novel theoretical tools and models are being developed in order to explain the experimental results. We provide a model calculation for the two-dimensional electronic spectra of Cholorobaculum tepidum which correctly describes the main features and transfer time scales found in recent experiments. From our calculation one can infer the coupling of the antenna chlorosome with the environment and the coupling between the chlorosome and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. We show that environment assisted transport between the subunits is the required mechanism to reproduce the experimental two-dimensional electronic spectra.,Human
"Muon Spin Rotation is employed to investigate the spin dynamics of ferritin proteins isolated from the brain of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient and of a healthy control, using a sample of horse-spleen ferritin as a reference. A model based on the N\'eel theory of superparamagnetism is developed in order to interpret the spin relaxation rate of the muons stopped by the core of the protein. Using this model, our preliminary observations show that ferritins from the healthy control are filled with a mineral compatible with ferrihydrite, while ferritins from the AD patient contain a crystalline phase with a larger magnetocrystalline anisotropy, possibly compatible with magnetite or maghemite.",Human
"Ultrasound-modulated optical tomography (UOT) is a technique that images optical contrast deep inside scattering media. Heterodyne holography is a promising tool able to detect the UOT tagged photons with high efficiency. In this work, we describe theoretically the detection of the tagged photon in heterodyne holography based UOT, show how to filter the untagged photon, and discuss the effect of shot noise. The discussion considers also speckle decorrelation. We show that optimal detection sensitivity can be reached, if the frame exposure time of the camera used to perform the holographic detection is of the order of the decorrelation time.",Human
"The brain forms and stores distributed representations from sparse external input that compete for neuronal resources with already stored memory traces. It is unclear what dynamical properties of neural systems allow formation and subsequent consolidation of new, distributed memory representations under these conditions. Here we use analytical, computational, and experimental approaches to show that a dynamical regime near a phase-transition in neuronal network activity (i.e. criticality) may play an important role in this process. Our results reveal that near-critical dynamics are necessary to stabilize and store new sparsely driven representations when they compete with native network states.",Human
"The propagation of a beneficial mutation in a spatially extended population is usually studied using the phenomenological stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov (SFKPP) equation. We derive here an individual based, stochastic model founded on the spatial Moran process where fluctuations are treated exactly. At high selection pressure, the results of this model are different from the classical FKPP. At small selection pressure, the front behavior can be mapped into a Brownian motion with drift, the properties of which can be derived from microscopic parameters of the Moran model. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient and the noise amplitude of SFKPP are not independent parameters but are both determined by the dispersal kernel of individuals.",Human
"We map a class of well-mixed stochastic models of biochemical feedback in steady state to the mean-field Ising model near the critical point. The mapping provides an effective temperature, magnetic field, order parameter, and heat capacity that can be extracted from biological data without fitting or knowledge of the underlying molecular details. We demonstrate this procedure on fluorescence data from mouse T cells, which reveals distinctions between how the cells respond to different drugs. We also show that the heat capacity allows inference of absolute molecule number from fluorescence intensity. We explain this result in terms of the underlying fluctuations and demonstrate the generality of our work.",Human
"We discuss the gauge field theory approach to protein structure study, which allows a natural way to introduce collective degrees of freedom and nonlinear topological structures. Local symmetry of proteins and its breaking in the medium is considered, what allows to derive Abelian Higgs model of protein backbone, correct folding of which is defined by gauge symmetry breaking due hydrophobic forces. Within this model structure of protein backbone is defined by superposition of one-dimensional topological solitons (kinks), what allows to reproduce the three-dimensional structure of the protein backbone with precision up to 1A and to predict its dynamics.",Human
"The complicated, evolving landscape of cancer mutations poses a formidable challenge to identify cancer genes among the large lists of mutations typically generated in NGS experiments. The ability to prioritize these variants is therefore of paramount importance. To address this issue we developed OncoScore, a text-mining tool that ranks genes according to their association with cancer, based on available biomedical literature. Receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) metrics on manually curated datasets confirmed the excellent discriminating capability of OncoScore (OncoScore cut-off threshold = 21.09; AUC = 90.3%, 95% CI: 88.1-92.5%), indicating that OncoScore provides useful results in cases where an efficient prioritization of cancer-associated genes is needed.",Human
"By means of a recently-proposed metric or structural derivative, called scale-q-derivative approach, we formulate differential equation that models the cell death by a radiation exposure in tumor treatments. The considered independent variable here is the absorbed radiation dose D instead of usual time. The survival factor, Fs, for radiation damaged cell obtained here is in agreement with the literature on the maximum entropy principle, as it was recently shown and also exhibits an excellent agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the well-known linear and quadratic models are obtained. With this approach, we give a step forward and suggest other expressions for survival factors that are dependent on the complex tumor structure.",Human
"In living cells, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by specific enzymes and connect to one another by sharing substrates and products, forming complex networks. In our previous studies, we established a framework determining the responses to enzyme perturbations only from network topology, and then proved a theorem, called the law of localization, explaining response patterns in terms of network topology. In this paper, we generalize these results to reaction networks with conserved concentrations, which allows us to study any reaction systems. We also propose novel network characteristics quantifying robustness. We compare E. coli metabolic network with randomly rewired networks, and find that the robustness of the E. coli network is significantly higher than that of the random networks.",Human
"Thermodynamic bulk measurements of binding reactions critically rely on the validity of the law of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution. Yet important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, macromolecular crowding, or misfolded molecules may not follow this fundamental law and require a particular reaction model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-molecule force-spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity and allostery of nucleic acids, proteins and peptides in a model-independent fashion. This work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond unimolecular folding reactions, bridging the thermodynamics of small systems and the basic laws of chemical equilibrium.",Human
"At present, multi-electrode array (MEA) approach and optical recording allow us to acquire plant electrical activity with higher spatio-temporal resolution. To understand the dynamic information flow of the electrical signaling system and estimate the effective connectivity, we proposed a solution to combine the two casualty analysis approaches, i.e. Granger causality and transfer entropy, which they complement each other to measure dynamics effective connectivity of the complex system. Our findings in three qualitatively different levels of plant bioelectrical activities revealed direction of information flow and dynamic complex causal connectives by using the two causal analysis approaches, especially indicated that the direction of information flow is not only along the longitudinal section but also spreading in transection.",Human
"Here we report a method for visualization of volumetric structural information of live biological samples with no exogenous contrast agents. The process is made possible through a technique that involves generation, synthesis and analysis of three-dimensional (3D) Fourier components of light diffracted by the sample. This leads to the direct recovery of quantitative cellular morphology with no iterative procedures for reduced computational complexity. Combing with the fact that the technique is easily adaptive to any imaging platform and requires minimum sample preparation, our proposed method is particularly promising for observing fast, volumetric and dynamic events previously only accessible through staining methods.",Human
"We establish a general linear response relation for spiking neuronal networks, based on chains with unbounded memory. This relation allows us to predict the influence of a weak amplitude time-dependent external stimuli on spatio-temporal spike correlations, from the spontaneous statistics (without stimulus) in a general context where the memory in spike dynamics can extend arbitrarily far in the past. Using this approach, we show how linear response is explicitly related to neuronal dynamics with an example, the gIF model, introduced by M. Rudolph and A. Destexhe. This example illustrates the collective effect of the stimuli, intrinsic neuronal dynamics, and network connectivity on spike statistics. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations.",Human
"The correct prediction of protein secondary structures is one of the key issues in predicting the correct protein folded shape, which is used for determining gene function. Existing methods make use of amino acids properties as indices to classify protein secondary structures, but are faced with a significant number of misclassifications. The paper presents a technique for the classification of protein secondary structures based on protein ""signal-plotting"" and the use of the Fourier technique for digital signal processing. New indices are proposed to classify protein secondary structures by analyzing hydrophobicity profiles. The approach is simple and straightforward. Results show that the more types of protein secondary structures can be classified by means of these newly-proposed indices.",Human
The present study reports interesting findings in regard to emotional arousal based activities while listening to two Hindustani classical ragas of contrast emotion. EEG data was taken on 5 naive listeners while they listened to two ragas Bahar and Mia ki Malhar which are conventionally known to portray contrast emotions. The EEG data were analyzed with the help of two robust non linear tools viz. Adaptive Fractal Analysis (AFA) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). A comparative study of the Hurst Exponents obtained from the two methods have been shown which shows that DFA provides more rigorous results compared to AFA when it comes to the scaling analysis of biosignal data. The results and implications have been discussed in detail.,Human
"We present a new method for the separation of superimposed, independent, auto-correlated components from noisy multi-channel measurement. The presented method simultaneously reconstructs and separates the components, taking all channels into account and thereby increases the effective signal-to-noise ratio considerably, allowing separations even in the high noise regime. Characteristics of the measurement instruments can be included, allowing for application in complex measurement situations. Independent posterior samples can be provided, permitting error estimates on all desired quantities. Using the concept of information field theory, the algorithm is not restricted to any dimensionality of the underlying space or discretization scheme thereof.",Human
"Life science is entering a new era of petabyte-level sequencing data. Converting such big data to biological insights represents a huge challenge for computational analysis. To this end, we developed DeepMetabolism, a biology-guided deep learning system to predict cell phenotypes from transcriptomics data. By integrating unsupervised pre-training with supervised training, DeepMetabolism is able to predict phenotypes with high accuracy (PCC>0.92), high speed (<30 min for >100 GB data using a single GPU), and high robustness (tolerate up to 75% noise). We envision DeepMetabolism to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype and to serve as a springboard for applications in synthetic biology and precision medicine.",Human
"High throughput immune repertoire sequencing is promising to lead to new statistical diagnostic tools for medicine and biology. Successful implementations of these methods require a correct characterization, analysis and interpretation of these datasets. We present IGoR -- a new comprehensive tool that takes B or T-cell receptors sequence reads and quantitatively characterizes the statistics of receptor generation from both cDNA and gDNA. It probabilistically annotates sequences and its modular structure can investigate models of increasing biological complexity for different organisms. For B-cells IGoR returns the hypermutation statistics, which we use to reveal co-localization of hypermutations along the sequence. We demonstrate that IGoR outperforms existing tools in accuracy and estimate the sample sizes needed for reliable repertoire characterization.",Human
"A grand canonical Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm is presented for studying the lattice gas model (LGM) of multiple protein sequence alignment, which coherently combines long-range interactions and variable-length insertions. MC simulations are used for both parameter optimization of the model and production runs to explore the sequence subspace around a given protein family. In this Note, I describe the details of the MC algorithm as well as some preliminary results of MC simulations with various temperatures and chemical potentials, and compare them with the mean-field approximation. The existence of a two-state transition in the sequence space is suggested for the SH3 domain family, and inappropriateness of the mean-field approximation for the LGM is demonstrated.",Human
"The internal deformation of the brain is far more complex than the rigid motion of the skull. An ultrasound imaging technique that we have developed has a combination of penetration, frame-rate, and motion detection accuracy required to directly observe, for the first time, the formation and evolution of shear shock waves in the brain. Experiments at low impacts on the traumatic brain injury scale demonstrate that they are spontaneously generated and propagate within the porcine brain. Compared to the initially smooth impact, the acceleration at the shock front is amplified up to a factor of 8.5. This highly localized increase in acceleration suggests that shear shock waves are a fundamental mechanism for traumatic injuries in soft tissue.",Human
"We investigate the dynamics of the heterodimer autorepression loop (HAL), a small genetic module in which a protein A acts as an auto-repressor and binds to a second protein B to form a AB dimer. For suitable values of the rate constants the HAL produces pulses of A alternating with pulses of B. By means of analytical and numerical calculations, we show that the duration of A-pulses is extremely robust against variation of the rate constants while the duration of the B-pulses can be flexibly adjusted. The HAL is thus a minimal genetic module generating robust pulses with tunable duration an interesting property for cellular signalling.",Human
"We present a novel extended-focus optical coherence microscope (OCM) attaining 0.7 {\mu}m axial and 0.4 {\mu}m lateral resolution maintained over a depth of 40 {\mu}m, while preserving the advantages of Fourier domain OCM. Our method uses an ultra-broad spectrum from a super- continuum laser source. As the spectrum spans from near-infrared to visible wavelengths (240 nm in bandwidth), we call the method visOCM. The combination of such a broad spectrum with a high-NA objective creates an almost isotropic 3D submicron resolution. We analyze the imaging performance of visOCM on microbead samples and demonstrate its image quality on cell cultures and ex-vivo mouse brain tissue.",Human
"We analyse the unfolding pathway of biomolecules comprising several independent modules in pulling experiments. In a recently proposed model, a critical velocity $v_{c}$ has been predicted, such that for pulling speeds $v>v_{c}$ it is the module at the pulled end that opens first, whereas for $v<v_{c}$ it is the weakest. Here, we introduce a variant of the model that is closer to the experimental setup, and discuss the robustness of the emergence of the critical velocity and of its dependence on the model parameters. We also propose a possible experiment to test the theoretical predictions of the model, which seems feasible with state-of-art molecular engineering techniques.",Human
"The ""Kill the Winner"" hypothesis is an attempt to address the problem of diversity in biology. It argues that host-specific predators control the population of each prey, preventing a winner from emerging and thus maintaining the coexistence of all species in the system. We develop a stochastic model for the ""Kill the Winner"" paradigm and show that the stable coexistence state of the deterministic ""Kill the Winner"" model is destroyed by demographic stochasticity, through a cascade of extinction events. We formulate an individual-level stochastic model in which predator-prey coevolution promotes high diversity of the ecosystem by generating a persistent population flux of species.",Human
"Asymmetric $\rm \beta$-sheet protein structures in spider silk should induce nonlinear optical interaction such as second harmonic generation (SHG) which is experimentally observed for a radial line and dragline spider silk by using an imaging femtosecond laser SHG microscope. By comparing different spider silks, we found that the SHG signal correlates with the existence of the protein $\rm \beta$-sheets. Measurements of the polarization dependence of SHG from the dragline indicated that the $\rm \beta$-sheet has a nonlinear response depending on the direction of the incident electric field. We propose a model of what orientation the $\rm \beta$-sheet takes in spider silk.",Human
"The goal of the Human Brain Project is to develop during the next decade an infrastructure necessary for running a simulation of the entire human brain constrained by current experimental data. One of the key issues is therefore to integrate and make accessible the experimental data necessary to constrain and fully specify this model. The required data covers many different spatial scales, ranging from the molecular scale to the whole brain and these data are obtained using a variety of techniques whose measurements may not be directly comparable. Furthermore, these data are incomplete, and will remain so at least for the coming decade. Here we review new neuroinformatics techniques that need to be developed and applied to address these issues.",Human
"Disease, opinions, ideas, gossip, etc. all spread on social networks. How these networks are connected (the network structure) influences the dynamics of the spreading processes. By investigating these relationships one gains understanding both of the spreading itself and the structure and function of the contact network. In this chapter, we will summarize the recent literature using simulation of spreading processes on top of empirical contact data. We will mostly focus on disease simulations on temporal proximity networks -- networks recording who is close to whom, at what time -- but also cover other types of networks and spreading processes. We analyze 29 empirical networks to illustrate the methods.",Human
"It is generally difficult to predict the positions of mutations in genomic DNA at the nucleotide level. Retroviral DNA insertion is one mode of mutation, resulting in host infections that are difficult to treat. This mutation process involves the integration of retroviral DNA into the host-infected cellular genomic DNA following the interaction between host DNA and a pre-integration complex consisting of retroviral DNA and integrase. Here, we report that retroviral insertion sites around a hotspot within the Zfp521 and N-myc genes can be predicted by a periodic function that is deduced using the diffraction lattice model. In conclusion, the mutagenesis process is described by a biophysical model for DNA-DNA interactions.",Human
"Signal transduction networks can form highly interconnected systems within cells due to network crosstalk, the sharing of input signals between multiple downstream responses. To better understand the evolutionary design principles underlying such networks, we study the evolution of crosstalk and the emergence of specificity for two parallel signaling pathways that arise via gene duplication and are subsequently allowed to diverge. We focus on a sequence based evolutionary algorithm and evolve the network based on two physically motivated fitness functions related to information transmission. Surprisingly, we find that the two fitness functions lead to very different evolutionary outcomes, one with a high degree of crosstalk and the other without.",Human
"The brain can be understood as a collection of interacting neuronal oscillators, but the extent to which its sustained activity is due to coupling among brain areas is still unclear. Here we study the joint dynamics of two cortical columns described by Jansen-Rit neural mass models, and show that coupling between the columns gives rise to stochastic initiations of sustained collective activity, which can be interpreted as epileptic events. For large enough coupling strengths, termination of these events results mainly from the emergence of synchronization between the columns, and thus is controlled by coupling instead of noise. Stochastic triggering and noise-independent durations are characteristic of excitable dynamics, and thus we interpret our results in terms of collective excitability.",Human
"A theoretical analysis of the unfolding pathway of simple modular proteins in length- controlled pulling experiments is put forward. Within this framework, we predict the first module to unfold in a chain of identical units, emphasizing the ranges of pulling speeds in which we expect our theory to hold. These theoretical predictions are checked by means of steered molecular dynamics of a simple construct, specifically a chain composed of two coiled-coils motives, where anisotropic features are revealed. These simulations also allow us to give an estimate for the range of pulling velocities in which our theoretical approach is valid.",Human
"We present an analytical framework that allows the quantitative study of statistical dynamic properties of networks with adaptive nodes that have memory and is used to examine the emergence of oscillations in networks with response failures. The frequency of the oscillations was quantitatively found to increase with the excitability of the nodes and with the average degree of the network and to decrease with delays between nodes. For networks of networks, diverse cluster oscillation modes were found as a function of the topology. Analytical results are in agreement with large-scale simulations and open the horizon for understanding network dynamics composed of finite memory nodes as well as their different phases of activity.",Human
"Many simple RNA viruses enclose their genetic material by a protein shell called the capsid. While the capsid structures are well characterized for most viruses, the structure of RNA inside the shells and the factors contributing to it remain poorly understood. We study the impact of base pairing on the conformations of RNA and find that it undergoes a swollen coil to globule continuous transition as a function of the strength of the pairing interaction. We also observe a first order transition and kink profile as a function of RNA length. All these transitions could explain the different RNA profiles observed inside viral shells.",Human
"There does not exist a general positive correlation between important life-supporting properties and the entropy production rate. The simple reason is that nondissipative and time-symmetric kinetic aspects are also relevant for establishing optimal functioning. In fact those aspects are even crucial in the nonlinear regimes around equilibrium where we find biological processing on mesoscopic scales. We make these claims specific via examples of molecular motors, of circadian cycles and of sensory adaptation, whose performance in some regimes is indeed spoiled by increasing the dissipated power. We use the relation between dissipation and the amount of time-reversal breaking to keep the discussion quantitative also in effective models where the physical entropy production is not clearly identifiable.",Human
"The artificial axon is an excitable node built with the basic biomolecular components and supporting action potentials. Here we demonstrate coincidence firing (the AND operation) and other basic electrophysiology features such as increasing firing rates for increasing input currents. We construct the basic unit for a network by connecting two such excitable nodes through an electronic synapse, producing pre/post synaptic behavior in which one axon induces firing in another. We show that the system is well described by the Hodgkin-Huxley model of nerve excitability, and conclude with a brief outlook for realizing large networks of such low voltage ""ionics"".",Human
"In this paper we study some deterministic mathematical models that seek to explain the expansion of zika virus, as a viral epidemic, using published data for Brazil. SIR type models are proposed and validated using the epidemic data found, considering several aspects in the spread of the disease. Finally, we confirmed that the crucial epidemic parameter such as $R_0$ is consistent with those previously reported in the literature for other areas. We also explored variations of the parameters within Brazil for different federal entities. We concluded that a parsimonious model that includes both human and vector populations best describe the epidemic parameters.",Human
"Many proteoforms - arising from alternative splicing, post-translational modifications (PTMs), or paralogous genes - have distinct biological functions, such as histone PTM proteoforms. However, their quantification by existing bottom-up mass-spectrometry (MS) methods is undermined by peptide-specific biases. To avoid these biases, we developed and implemented a first-principles model (HIquant) for quantifying proteoform stoichiometries. We characterized when MS data allow inferring proteoform stoichiometries by HIquant, derived an algorithm for optimal inference, and demonstrated experimentally high accuracy in quantifying fractional PTM occupancy without using external standards, even in the challenging case of the histone modification code.   HIquant server is implemented at: https://web.northeastern.edu/slavov/2014_HIquant/",Human
"In the past two decades, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging has been used to relate neuronal network activity to cognitive processing and behaviour. Recently this approach has been augmented by algorithms that allow us to infer causal links between component populations of neuronal networks. Multiple inference procedures have been proposed to approach this research question but so far, each method has limitations when it comes to establishing whole-brain connectivity patterns. In this work, we discuss eight ways to infer causality in fMRI research: Bayesian Nets, Dynamical Causal Modelling, Granger Causality, Likelihood Ratios, LiNGAM, Patel's Tau, Structural Equation Modelling, and Transfer Entropy. We finish with formulating some recommendations for the future directions in this area.",Human
"Single-cell gene expression is inherently stochastic; its emergent behavior can be defined in terms of the chemical master equation describing the evolution of the mRNA and protein copy numbers as the latter tends to infinity. We establish two types of ""macroscopic limits"": the Kurtz limit is consistent with the classical chemical kinetics, while the L\'{e}vy limit provides a theoretical foundation for an empirical equation proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97:168302, 2006]. Furthermore, we clarify the biochemical implications and ranges of applicability for various macroscopic limits and calculate a comprehensive analytic expression for the protein concentration distribution in autoregulatory gene networks. The relationship between our work and modern population genetics is discussed.",Human
"Various approaches to alignment-free sequence comparison are based on the length of exact or inexact word matches between two input sequences. Haubold {\em et al.} (2009) showed how the average number of substitutions between two DNA sequences can be estimated based on the average length of exact common substrings. In this paper, we study the length distribution of $k$-mismatch common substrings between two sequences. We show that the number of substitutions per position that have occurred since two sequences have evolved from their last common ancestor, can be estimated from the position of a local maximum in the length distribution of their $k$-mismatch common substrings.",Human
"We estimate treatment cost-savings from early cancer diagnosis. For breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancers and melanoma, which account for more than 50% of new incidences projected in 2017, we combine published cancer treatment cost estimates by stage with incidence rates by stage at diagnosis. We extrapolate to other cancer sites by using estimated national expenditures and incidence rates. A rough estimate for the U.S. national annual treatment cost-savings from early cancer diagnosis is in 11 digits. Using this estimate and cost-neutrality, we also estimate a rough upper bound on the cost of a routine early cancer screening test.",Human
"Traveling waves describe diverse natural phenomena from crystal growth in physics to range expansions in biology. Two classes of waves exist with very different properties: pulled and pushed. Pulled waves are driven by high growth rates at the expansion edge, where the number of organisms is small and fluctuations are large. In contrast, fluctuations are suppressed in pushed waves because the region of maximal growth is shifted towards the population bulk. Although it is commonly believed that expansions are either pulled or pushed, we found an intermediate class of waves with bulk-driven growth, but exceedingly large fluctuations. These waves are unusual because their properties are controlled by both the leading edge and the bulk of the front.",Human
"Elastic confinements are an important component of many biological systems and dictate the transport properties of suspended particles under flow. In this chapter, we review the Brownian motion of a particle moving in the vicinity of a living cell whose membrane is endowed with a resistance towards shear and bending. The analytical calculations proceed through the computation of the frequency-dependent mobility functions and the application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Elastic interfaces endow the system with memory effects that lead to a long-lived anomalous subdiffusive regime of nearby particles. In the steady limit, the diffusional behavior approaches that near a no-slip hard wall. The analytical predictions are validated and supplemented with boundary-integral simulations.",Human
"Recent studies have proposed that the diffusion of messenger molecules, such as monoamines, can mediate the plastic adaptation of synapses in supervised learning of neural networks. Based on these findings we developed a model for neural learning, where the signal for plastic adaptation is assumed to propagate through the extracellular space. We investigate the conditions allowing learning of Boolean rules in a neural network. Even fully excitatory networks show very good learning performances. Moreover, the investigation of the plastic adaptation features optimizing the performance suggests that learning is very sensitive to the extent of the plastic adaptation and the spatial range of synaptic connections.",Human
"A numerical method using implicit surface representations is proposed to solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equations that arise in mathematical models for the electrostatics of molecules in solvent. The proposed method used an implicit boundary integral formulation to derived a linear system defined on Cartesian nodes in a narrowband surrounding the closed surface that separate the molecule and the solvent. The needed implicit surfaces is constructed from the given atomic description of the molecules, by a sequence of standard level set algorithms. A fast multipole method is applied to accelerate the solution of the linear system. A few numerical studies involving some standard test cases are presented and compared to other existing results.",Human
"We study the buckling of an idealized, semiflexible filament along whose contour magnetic moments are placed. {We give analytic expressions for the critical stiffness of the filament below which it buckles due to the magnetic compression. For this, we consider various scenarios of the attachment of the magnetic particles to the filament. One possible application for this model are the magnetosome chains of magnetotactic bacteria. An estimate of the critical bending stiffness indicates that buckling may occur within the range of biologically relevant parameters and suggests a role for the bending stiffness of the filament to stabilize the filament against buckling, which would compromise the functional relevance of the bending stiffness of the used filament.",Human
"We consider the task of detecting regulatory elements in the human genome directly from raw DNA. Past work has focused on small snippets of DNA, making it difficult to model long-distance dependencies that arise from DNA's 3-dimensional conformation. In order to study long-distance dependencies, we develop and release a novel dataset for a larger-context modeling task. Using this new data set we model long-distance interactions using dilated convolutional neural networks, and compare them to standard convolutions and recurrent neural networks. We show that dilated convolutions are effective at modeling the locations of regulatory markers in the human genome, such as transcription factor binding sites, histone modifications, and DNAse hypersensitivity sites.",Human
"Deterministic evolutionary game dynamics can lead to stable coexistences of different types. Stochasticity, however, drives the loss of such coexistences. This extinction is usually accompanied by population size fluctuations. We investigate the most probable extinction trajectory under such fluctuations by mapping a stochastic evolutionary model to a problem of classical mechanics using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. Our results show that more abundant types in a coexistence can be more likely to go extinct first well agreed with previous results, and also the distance between the coexistence and extinction point is not a good predictor of extinction. Instead, the WKB method correctly predicts the type going extinct first.",Human
"Photothermal effects of gold core-shell nanoparticles and nanorods dispersed in water are theoretically investigated using the transient bioheat equation and the extended Mie theory. Properly calculating the absorption cross section is an extremely crucial milestone to determine the elevation of solution temperature. The nanostructures are assumed to be randomly and uniformly distributed in the solution. Compared to previous experiments, our theoretical temperature increase during laser light illumination provides, in various systems, both reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement. This approach can be a highly reliable tool to predict photothermal effects in experimentally unexplored structures. We also validate our approach and discuss its limitations.",Human
"Membrane protein transporters alternate their substrate-binding sites between the extracellular and cytosolic side of the membrane according to the alternating access mechanism. Inspired by this intriguing mechanism devised by nature, we study particle transport through a channel coupled with an energy well that oscillates its position between the two entrances of the channel. We optimize particle transport across the channel by adjusting the oscillation frequency. At the optimal oscillation frequency, the translocation rate through the channel is a hundred times higher with respect to free diffusion across the channel. Our findings reveal the effect of time dependent potentials on particle transport across a channel and will be relevant for membrane transport and microfluidics application.",Human
"To survive starvation, Bacillus subtilis forms durable spores. After asymmetric cell division, the septum grows around the forespore in a process called engulfment, but the mechanism of force generation is unknown. Here, we derived a novel biophysical model for the dynamics of cell-wall remodeling during engulfment based on a balancing of dissipative, active, and mechanical forces. By plotting phase diagrams, we predict that sporulation is promoted by a line tension from the attachment of the septum to the outer cell wall, as well as by an imbalance in turgor pressures in the mother-cell and forespore compartments. We also predict that significant mother-cell growth hinders engulfment. Hence, relatively simple physical principles may guide this complex biological process.",Human
"Stochastic simulations of cyclic three-species spatial predator-prey models are usually performed in square lattices with nearest neighbor interactions starting from random initial conditions. In this Letter we describe the results of off-lattice Lotka-Volterra stochastic simulations, showing that the emergence of spiral patterns does occur for sufficiently high values of the (conserved) total density of individuals. We also investigate the dynamics in our simulations, finding an empirical relation characterizing the dependence of the characteristic peak frequency and amplitude on the total density. Finally, we study the impact of the total density on the extinction probability, showing how a low population density may jeopardize biodiversity.",Human
"Effective intervention strategies for epidemics rely on the identification of their origin and on the robustness of the predictions made by network disease models. We introduce a Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework to infer model parameters for a disease spreading on a network of communities from limited, noisy observations; the state-of-the-art computational framework compensates for the model complexity by exploiting massively parallel computing architectures. Using noisy, synthetic data, we show the potential of the approach to perform robust model fitting and additionally demonstrate that we can effectively identify the disease origin via Bayesian model selection. As disease-related data are increasingly available, the proposed framework has broad practical relevance for the prediction and management of epidemics.",Human
"We propose a mean-field model of intermittent particle transport, where a particle may be in one of two phases: the first is an active (ballistic) phase, when a particle runs with constant velocity in some direction, and the second is a passive (diffusive) phase, when the particle diffuses freely. The particle can instantly change the phase of motion. When the particle is in the active phase the rate of transition to the passive phase depends, in general, on time from the beginning of the run, so the distribution of the free path is not exponential. When the particle is in the passive phase the transition rate is constant, and diffusion is non-anomalous Brownian.",Human
"Brain plasticity refers to brain's ability to change neuronal connections, as a result of environmental stimuli, new experiences, or damage. In this work, we study the effects of the synaptic delay on both the coupling strengths and synchronisation in a neuronal network with synaptic plasticity. We build a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, where the plasticity is given by the Hebbian rules. We verify that without time delay the excitatory synapses became stronger from the high frequency to low frequency neurons and the inhibitory synapses increases in the opposite way, when the delay is increased the network presents a non-trivial topology. Regarding the synchronisation, only for small values of the synaptic delay this phenomenon is observed.",Human
"The first of $N$ identical independently distributed (i.i.d.) Brownian trajectories that arrives to a small target, sets the time scale of activation, which in general is much faster than the arrival to the target of only a single trajectory. Analytical asymptotic expressions for the minimal time is notoriously difficult to compute in general geometries. We derive here asymptotic laws for the probability density function of the first and second arrival times of a large number of i.i.d. Brownian trajectories to a small target in 1,2, and 3 dimensions and study their range of validity by stochastic simulations. The results are applied to activation of biochemical pathways in cellular transduction.",Human
"The real part of the refractive index (RI) of aqueous solutions of human hemoglobin is computed from their absorption spectra in the wavelength range $250\,{\rm nm} - 1100\,{\rm nm}$ using the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relations and the corresponding uncertainty analysis is provided. The strong ultraviolet (UV) and infrared absorbance of the water outside this spectral range were taken into account in a previous study employing KK relations. We improve these results by including the concentration dependence of the water absorbance as well as by modeling the deep UV absorbance of hemoglobin's peptide backbone. The two free parameters of the model for the deep UV absorbance are fixed by a global fit.",Human
"Mathematicians have always been attracted to the field of genetics. I am especially interested in the mathematical aspects of research on homosexuality. Certain studies show that male homosexuality may have a genetic component that is correlated with female fertility. Other studies show the existence of the fraternal birth order effect, that is the correlation of homosexuality with the number of older brothers.   This paper is devoted to the mathematical aspects of how these two phenomena are interconnected. In particular, I show that the fraternal birth order effect produces a correlation between homosexuality and maternal fecundity. Vice versa, I show that the correlation between homosexuality and female fecundity implies the increase of the probability of the younger brothers being homosexual.",Human
A numerical simulation infrastructure capable of calculating the flow of gas and the trajectories of particles through an aerodynamic lens injector is presented. The simulations increase the fundamental understanding and predict optimized injection geometries and parameters. Our simulation results were compared to previous reports and also validated against experimental data for 500 nm polystyrene spheres from an aerosol-beam- characterization setup. The simulations yielded a detailed understanding of the radial phase-space distribution and highlighted weaknesses of current aerosol injectors for single-particle diffractive imaging. With the aid of these simulations we developed new experimental implementations to overcome current limitations.,Human
"The spread of an infectious disease is known to change people's behavior, which in turn affects the spread of disease. Adaptive network models that account for both epidemic and behavior change have found oscillations, but in an extremely narrow region of the parameter space, which contrasts with intuition and available data. In this paper we propose a simple SIS epidemic model on an adaptive network with time-delayed rewiring, and show that oscillatory solutions are now present in a wide region of the parameter space. Altering the transmission or rewiring rates reveals the presence of an endemic bubble - an enclosed region of the parameter space where oscillations are observed.",Human
"The need for high-throughput, precise, and meaningful methods for measuring behavior has been amplified by our recent successes in measuring and manipulating neural circuitry. The largest challenges associated with moving in this direction, however, are not technical but are instead conceptual: what numbers should one put on the movements an animal is performing (or not performing)? In this review, I will describe how theoretical and data analytical ideas are interfacing with recently-developed computational and experimental methodologies to answer these questions across a variety of contexts, length scales, and time scales. I will attempt to highlight commonalities between approaches and areas where further advances are necessary to place behavior on the same quantitative footing as other scientific fields.",Human
"Receptor-induced apoptosis is a complex signal transduction pathway involving numerous protein/protein interactions and post-transcriptional modifications. The response to death receptor stimulation varies significantly from one cell line to another and even from one cell to another within a given cell line. In this context, it is often difficult to assess whether the molecular mechanisms identified so far are sufficient to explain the rich quantitative observations now available, and to detect possible gaps in our understanding. This is precisely where computational systems biology approaches may contribute. In this chapter, we review studies done in this direction, focusing on those that provided significant insight on the functioning of this complex pathway by tightly integrating experimental and computational approaches.",Human
"Anatomical studies demonstrate that brain reformats input information to generate reliable responses for performing computations. However, it remains unclear how neural circuits encode complex spatio-temporal patterns. We show that neural dynamics are strongly influenced by the phase alignment between the input and the spontaneous chaotic activity. Input structuring along the dominant chaotic projections causes the chaotic trajectories to become stable channels (or attractors), hence, improving the computational capability of a recurrent network. Using mean field analysis, we derive the impact of input structuring on the overall stability of attractors formed. Our results indicate that input alignment determines the extent of intrinsic noise suppression and hence, alters the attractor state stability, thereby controlling the network's inference ability.",Human
"This paper presents a novel optical processing approach for exploring genome sequences built upon optical correlator for global alignment and extended DV-curve method for local alignment. To overcome the problem of traditional DV-curve method for presenting an accurate and simplified output, we propose HAWPOD, built upon DV- curve method, to analyze genome sequences in five steps: DNA coding, alignment, noise cancellation, simplification, and modification. Moreover, all-optical implementation of the HAWPOD method is developed, while its accuracy is validated through numerical simulations in LUMERICAL FDTD. The results express the proposed method is much faster than its electrical counterparts, such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tools.",Human
"We report an acoustic approach to measure the elastic properties of an extracellular matrix (ECM). This approach uses a short range evanescent waves to inject sound into the test material over a short distance using an electroded quartz crystal, also known as a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). These measurements are applied with a press-to-contact approach to determine the elastic properties reliably and rapidly. The elasticity of ECM is connected to material chemistry which is linked to the tissue type and history. Measuring the minimum relative amplitude of the signal from the QCM shows that the acoustic response is strongly correlated to tissue type and age.",Human
"We study the behavior of five proteins at the air-water and oil-water interfaces by all-atom molecular dynamics. The proteins are found to get distorted when pinned to the interface. This behavior is consistent with the phenomenological way of introducing the interfaces in a coarse-grained model through a force that depends on the hydropathy indices of the residues. Proteins couple to the oil-water interface stronger than to the air- water one. They diffuse slower at the oil-water interface but do not depin from it, whereas depinning events are observed at the other interface. The reduction of the disulfide bonds slows the diffusion down.",Human
"This paper presents a comprehensive list of the scientific articles of Giulio Fermi (1936-1997), son of the Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, published between 1962 and 1997. The initial research activity of Giulio was concerned with virology and biological cybernetics while, from 1975 onward, his work was completely devoted to protein crystallography. The crystallographic research was carried out in collaboration with Nobel laureate Max Perutz at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge (United Kingdom). A short biography of Giulio (Judd) Fermi appears inside John Finch's book A Nobel Fellow on Every Floor: A History of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology published by the MRC in 2008.",Human
"Gene regulatory networks are powerful abstractions of biological systems. Since the advent of high-throughput measurement technologies in biology in the late 90s, reconstructing the structure of such networks has been a central computational problem in systems biology. While the problem is certainly not solved in its entirety, considerable progress has been made in the last two decades, with mature tools now available. This chapter aims to provide an introduction to the basic concepts underpinning network inference tools, attempting a categorisation which highlights commonalities and relative strengths. While the chapter is meant to be self-contained, the material presented should provide a useful background to the later, more specialised chapters of this book.",Human
"Recent work indicates that twist-bend coupling plays an important role in DNA micromechanics. Here we investigate its effect on bent DNA. We provide an analytical solution of the minimum-energy shape of circular DNA, showing that twist-bend coupling induces sinusoidal twist waves. This solution is in excellent agreement with both coarse-grained simulations of minicircles and nucleosomal DNA data, which is bent and wrapped around histone proteins in a superhelical conformation. Our analysis shows that the observed twist oscillation in nucleosomal DNA, so far attributed to the interaction with the histone proteins, is an intrinsic feature of free bent DNA, and should be observable in other protein-DNA complexes.",Human
"Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. Reproduction depends on the payoff a strategy receives. The payoff depends on the environment that may change over time, on intrinsic uncertainties, and on other sources of randomness. These temporal variations in the payoffs can affect which traits evolve. Understanding evolutionary game dynamics that are affected by varying payoffs remains difficult. Here we study the impact of arbitrary amplitudes and covariances of temporally varying payoffs on the dynamics. The evolutionary dynamics may be ""unfair"", meaning that, on average, two coexisting strategies may persistently receive different payoffs. This mechanism can induce an anomalous coexistence of cooperators and defectors in the Prisoner's Dilemma, and an unexpected selection reversal in the Hawk-Dove game.",Human
"Multiple scales in metapopulations can give rise to paradoxical behaviour: in a conceptual model for a public goods game, the species associated with a fitness cost due to the public good production can be stabilised in the well-mixed limit due to the mere existence of these scales. The scales in this model involve a length scale corresponding to separate patches, coupled by mobility, and separate time scales for reproduction and interaction with a local environment. Contrary to the well-mixed high mobility limit, we find that for low mobilities, the interaction rate progressively stabilises this species due to stochastic effects, and that the formation of spatial patterns is not crucial for this stabilisation.",Human
"Applying the method of moments to the chemical master equation (CME) appearing in stochastic chemical kinetics often leads to the so-called closure problem. Recently, several authors showed that this problem can be partially overcome using moment-based semidefinite programs (SDPs). In particular, they showed that moment-based SDPs can be used to calculate rigorous bounds on various descriptions of the stochastic chemical kinetic system's stationary distribution(s) -- for example, mean molecular counts, variances in these counts, and so on. In this paper, we show that these ideas can be extended to the corresponding dynamic problem, calculating time-varying bounds on the same descriptions.",Human
"A practical, biologically motivated case of protein complexes (immunoglobulin G and FcRII receptors) moving on the surface of mastcells, that are common parts of an immunological system, is investigated. Proteins are considered as nanomachines creating a nanonetwork. Accurate molecular models of the proteins and the fluorophores which act as their nanoantennas are used to simulate the communication between the nanomachines when they are close to each other. The theory of diffusion-based Brownian motion is applied to model movements of the proteins. It is assumed that fluorophore molecules send and receive signals using the Forster Resonance Energy Transfer. The probability of the efficient signal transfer and the respective bit error rate are calculated and discussed.",Human
"The availability of protein is an important factor for the determination of the size of the mitotic spindle. Involved in spindle-size regulation is kinesin-8, a molecular motor and microtubule (MT) depolymerase, which is known to tightly control MT length. Here, we propose and analyze a theoretical model in which kinesin-induced MT depolymerization competes with spontaneous polymerization while supplies of both tubulin and kinesin are limited. In contrast to previous studies where resources were unconstrained, we find that, for a wide range of concentrations, MT length regulation is bistable. We test our predictions by conducting in vitro experiments, and find that the bistable behavior manifests in a bimodal MT length distribution.",Human
"A function f is said to possess superoscillations if, in a finite region, f oscillates faster than the shortest wavelength that occurs in the Fourier transform of f. I will discuss four aspects of superoscillations: 1. Superoscillations can be generated efficiently and stably through multiplication. 2. There is a win-win situation in the sense that even in circumstances where superoscillations cannot be used for superresolution, they can be useful for what may be called superabsorption, an effective up-conversion of low frequencies 3. The study of superoscillations may be useful for generalizing the Shannon Hartley noisy channel capacity theorem. 4. The phenomenon of superoscillations naturally generalizes beyond bandlimited functions.",Human
"Double-stranded DNA may contain mismatched base pairs beyond the Watson-Crick pairs guanine-cytosine and adenine-thymine. Such mismatches bear adverse consequences for human health. We utilize molecular dynamics and metadynamics computer simulations to study the equilibrium structure and dynamics for both matched and mismatched base pairs. We discover significant differences between matched and mismatched pairs in structure, hydrogen bonding, and base flip work profiles. Mismatched pairs shift further in the plane normal to the DNA strand and are more likely to exhibit non-canonical structures, including the e-motif. We discuss potential implications on mismatch repair enzymes' detection of DNA mismatches.",Human
"The Voronoi-based cellular model is highly successful in describing the motion of two-dimensional confluent cell tissues. In the homogeneous version of this model, the energy of each cell is determined solely by its geometric shape and size, and the interaction between adjacent cells is a byproduct of this additive energy. We generalize this model so as to allow zero or partial contact between cells. We identify several phases, two of which (solid confluent and liquid confluent) were found in previous studies that imposed confluency but others that are novel. Transitions in this model may be relevant for understanding both normal development as well as cancer metastasis.",Human
"Measuring the average refractive index (RI) of spherical objects, such as suspended cells, in quantitative phase imaging (QPI) requires a decoupling of RI and size from the QPI data. This has been commonly achieved by determining the object's radius with geometrical approaches, neglecting light-scattering. Here, we present a novel QPI fitting algorithm that reliably uncouples the RI using Mie theory and a semi-analytical, corrected Rytov approach. We assess the range of validity of this algorithm in silico and experimentally investigate various objects (oil and protein droplets, microgel beads, cells) and noise conditions. In addition, we provide important practical cues for future studies in cell biology.",Human
"Eshel Ben-Jacob, one of the co-organizers of this meeting on collective behavior and one of the pioneers in the field of collective behavior in biology, passed away suddenly just before we convened. This article presents a brief glimpse of Eshel's life-long path through science, seen from the perspective of a decades long collaboration on many disparate yet ultimately connected topics. The article attempts to convey how the concept of self-organization of complex interacting objects into higher order functional units, as evidenced so wonderfully by Eshel's experiments on bacterial colony formation, provides a unifying theme for the study of collective behavior. Our entire field will miss his unique ability to ""let the complex become simple"".",Human
"We develop a theoretical framework for understanding dynamic morphologies and stability of droplet interface bilayers (DIBs), accounting for lipid kinetics in the monolayers and bilayer, and droplet evaporation due to imbalance between osmotic and Laplace pressures. Our theory quantitatively describes distinct pathways observed in experiments when DIBs become unstable. We find that when the timescale for lipid desorption is slow compared to droplet evaporation, the lipid bilayer will grow and the droplets approach a hemispherical shape. In contrast, when lipid desorption is fast, the bilayer area will shrink and the droplets eventually detach. Our model also suggests there is a critical size below which DIBs cannot be stable, which may explain experimental difficulties in miniaturising the DIB platform.",Human
"We introduce a stochastic model of coupled genetic oscillators in which chains of chemical events involved in gene regulation and expression are represented as sequences of Poisson processes. We characterize steady states by their frequency, their quality factor and their synchrony by the oscillator cross correlation. The steady state is determined by coupling and exhibits stochastic transitions between different modes. The interplay of stochasticity and nonlinearity leads to isolated regions in parameter space in which the coupled system works best as a biological pacemaker. Key features of the stochastic oscillations can be captured by an effective model for phase oscillators that are coupled by signals with distributed delays.",Human
"This paper reports nano-CT analysis of brain tissues of schizophrenia and control cases. The analysis revealed that: (1) neuronal structures vary between individuals, (2) the mean curvature of distal neurites of the schizophrenia cases was 1.5 times higher than that of the controls, and (3) dendritic spines were categorized into two geometrically distinctive groups, though no structural differences were observed between the disease and control cases. The differences in the neurite curvature result in differences in the spatial trajectory and hence alter neuronal circuits. We suggest that the structural alteration of neurons in the schizophrenia cases should reflect psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia.",Human
"Many pressing medical challenges - such as diagnosing disease, enhancing directed stem cell differentiation, and classifying cancers - have long been hindered by limitations in our ability to quantify proteins in single cells. Mass-spectrometry (MS) is poised to transcend these limitations by developing powerful methods to routinely quantify thousands of proteins and proteoforms across many thousands of single cells. We outline specific technological developments and ideas that can increase the sensitivity and throughput of single cell MS by orders of magnitude and usher in this new age. These advances will transform medicine and ultimately contribute to understanding biological systems on an entirely new level.",Human
"An algorithm based on PLS regression has been developed and optimized for measuring blood glucose level using the infra-red transmission spectrum of blood samples. A set of blood samples were tagged with their glucose concentration using an accurate invasive glucometer and analyzed using a standard FTIR spectrometer. Using the developed algorithm, the results of the FTIR spectroscopy of the samples were analyzed to find the glucose concentration in the samples. The obtained glucose concentration by the algorithm were in good agreement with the results obtained by the standard glucometer, and the mean estimation error was 7 mg/dL.

"Managing blood lipid levels is important for the treatment and prevention of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. An easy-to-use, portable lipid blood test will accelerate more frequent testing by patients and at-risk populations. We used smartphone systems that are already familiar to many people. Because smartphone systems can be carried around everywhere, blood can be measured easily and frequently. We compared the results of lipid tests with those of existing clinical diagnostic laboratory methods. We found that smartphone-based point-of-care lipid blood tests are as accurate as hospital-grade laboratory tests. Our system will be useful for those who need to manage blood lipid levels to motivate them to track and control their behavior.",Human
"Humans interact with each other on a daily basis by developing and maintaining various social norms and it is critical to form a deeper understanding of how such norms develop, how they change, and how fast they change. In this work, we develop an evolutionary game-theoretic model based on research in cultural psychology that shows that humans in various cultures differ in their tendencies to conform with those around them. Using this model, we analyze the evolutionary relationships between the tendency to conform and how quickly a population reacts when conditions make a change in norm desirable. Our analysis identifies conditions when a tipping point is reached in a population, causing norms to change rapidly.",Human
"The Gemini theorem asserts that, given certain reasonable assumptions, no physical system can be certainly aware of its own existence. The theorem can be proved algorithmically, but the proof of this theorem is somewhat obscure, and there exists very little literature on it. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief non-technical summary of the theorem and its proof, with a view to stimulating critical discussion of the proof and its implications. Since the theorem implies that a violation of the conservation of energy will take place within the brains of conscious human beings, it has obvious implications for any physical theory.",Human
"In this study, we investigate a porous medium-type flux limited reaction--diffusion equation that arises in morphogenesis modeling. This nonlinear partial differential equation is an extension of the generalized Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovsky--Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) equation in one-dimensional space. The approximate analytical traveling wave solution is found by using a perturbation method. We show that the morphogen concentration propagates as a sharp wave front where the wave speed has a saturated value. The numerical solutions of this equation are also provided to compare them with the analytical predictions. Finally, we qualitatively compare our theoretical results with those obtained in experimental studies.",Human
"Biological networks are a very convenient modelling and visualisation tool to discover knowledge from modern high-throughput genomics and postgenomics data sets. Indeed, biological entities are not isolated, but are components of complex multi-level systems. We go one step further and advocate for the consideration of causal representations of the interactions in living systems.We present the causal formalism and bring it out in the context of biological networks, when the data is observational. We also discuss its ability to decipher the causal information flow as observed in gene expression. We also illustrate our exploration by experiments on small simulated networks as well as on a real biological data set.",Human
"The production of mechanical stresses in living organisms largely relies on localized, force-generating active units embedded in filamentous matrices. Numerical simulations of discrete fiber networks with fixed boundaries have shown that buckling in the matrix dramatically amplifies the resulting active stresses. Here we extend this result to a bucklable continuum elastic medium subjected to an arbitrary external stress, and derive analytical expressions for the active, nonlinear constitutive relations characterizing the full active medium. Inserting these relations into popular ""active gel"" descriptions of living tissues and the cytoskeleton will enable investigations into nonlinear regimes previously inaccessible due to the phenomenological nature of these theories.",Human
"We discuss a less known aspect of Feynman's multifaceted scientific work, centered about his interest in molecular biology, which came out around 1959 and lasted for several years. After a quick historical reconstruction about the birth of molecular biology, we focus on Feynman's work on genetics with Robert S. Edgar in the laboratory of Max Delbruck, which was later quoted by Francis Crick and others in relevant papers, as well as in Feynman's lectures given at the Hughes Aircraft Company on biology, organic chemistry and microbiology, whose notes taken by the attendee John Neer are available. An intriguing perspective comes out about one of the most interesting scientists of the XX century.",Human
"We investigate the linearized hydrodynamic equations of interacting self-propelled particles in two dimensional space. It is found that the small perturbations of density and polarization fields satisfy the hyperbolic partial differential equations---that admit analytical propagating wave solutions. These solutions uncover the questionable traveling band formation in the flocking state of self-propelled particles. Below the critical noise strength, an unstable disordered state (random motion) undergoes a transient vortex and evolves to an ordered state (flocking motion) as unidirectional traveling waves. There appear two possible longitudinal wave patterns depending on the noise strength, including single band in stable state and multiplebands in unstable state. A comparison of theoretical and experimental studies is presented.",Human
"Inferring directional couplings from the spike data of networks is desired in various scientific fields such as neuroscience. Here, we apply a recently proposed objective procedure to the spike data obtained from the Hodgkin--Huxley type models and in vitro neuronal networks cultured in a circular structure. As a result, we succeed in reconstructing synaptic connections accurately from the evoked activity as well as the spontaneous one. To obtain the results, we invent an analytic formula approximately implementing a method of screening relevant couplings. This significantly reduces the computational cost of the screening method employed in the proposed objective procedure, making it possible to treat large-size systems as in this study.",Human
"Gene expression dynamics satisfying given input-output relationships were investigated by evolving the networks for an optimal response. We found three types of networks and corresponding dynamics, depending on the sensitivity of gene expression dynamics: direct response with straight paths, amplified response by a feed-forward network, and cooperative response with a complex network. When the sensitivity of each gene's response is low and expression dynamics is sloppy, the last type is selected, in which many genes respond collectively to inputs, with local-excitation and global-inhibition structures. The result provides an insight into how a reliable response is achieved with unreliable units, and on why complex networks with many genes are adopted in cells.",Human
"We propose an approach to analysing single trajectories of a particle, which moves randomly on a landscape distinct parts of which result in sufficiently various diffusion coefficients. The method based on the mapping the cumulative sum of step-wise elementary displacement squared into a complex oscillating functions with the subsequent continuous wavelet analysis of the later allows the localisation of relatively homogeneous sub-regions and determining values of the diffusion coefficient within each such sub-region. This approach is applied to demonstrable test examples as well as to the reconstruction of the biological membrane's properties from the real data of single molecule walk tracing.",Human
"We observe and study a self-organized phenomenon whereby the activity in a network of spiking neurons spontaneously terminates. We consider different types of populations, consisting of bistable model neurons connected electrically by gap junctions, or by either excitatory or inhibitory synapses, in a scale-free connection topology. We find that strongly synchronized population spiking events lead to complete cessation of activity in excitatory networks, but not in gap junction or inhibitory networks. We identify the underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon by examining the particular shape of the excitatory postsynaptic currents that arise in the neurons. We also examine the effects of the synaptic time constant, coupling strength, and channel noise on the occurrence of the phenomenon.",Human
"Molecular motors walk along filaments until they detach stochastically with a force-dependent unbinding rate. Here, we show that this unbinding rate can be obtained from the analysis of experimental data of molecular motors moving in stationary optical traps. Two complementary methods are presented, based on the analysis of the distribution for the unbinding forces and of the motor's force traces. In the first method, analytically derived force distributions for slip bonds, slip-ideal bonds, and catch bonds are used to fit the cumulative distributions of the unbinding forces. The second method is based on the statistical analysis of the observed force traces. We validate both methods with stochastic simulations and apply them to experimental data for kinesin-1.",Human
"The artificial axon is a recently introduced synthetic assembly of supported lipid bilayers and voltage gated ion channels, displaying the basic electrophysiology of nerve cells. Here we demonstrate the use of two artificial axons as control elements to achieve a simple task. Namely, we steer a remote control car towards a light source, using the sensory input dependent firing rate of the axons as the control signal for turning left or right. We present the result in the form of the analysis of a movie of the car approaching the light source. In general terms, with this work we pursue a constructivist approach to exploring the nexus between machine language at the nerve cell level and behavior.",Human
"The emerging field at the intersection of quantitative biology, network modeling, and control theory has enjoyed significant progress in recent years. This Special Issue brings together a selection of papers on complementary approaches to observe, identify, and control biological and biologically inspired networks. These approaches advance the state of the art in the field by addressing challenges common to many such networks, including high dimensionality, strong nonlinearity, uncertainty, and limited opportunities for observation and intervention. Because these challenges are not unique to biological systems, it is expected that many of the results presented in these contributions will also find applications in other domains, including physical, social, and technological networks.",Human
"Cochlea displays complex and highly nonlinear behavior in response to wide-ranging auditory stimuli. While there have been many recent advancements in the modeling of cochlear dynamics, it remains unclear what mathematical structures underlie the essential features of the extended cochlea. We construct a dynamical system consisting of a series of strongly coupled critical oscillators to show that high-dimensional nonhyperbolic dynamics can account for high-order compressive nonlinearities, amplification of weak input, frequency selectivity, and traveling waves of activity. As a single Hopf bifurcation generically gives rise to features of cochlea at a local level, the nonhyperbolicity mechanism proposed in this paper can be seen as a higher-dimensional analogue for the entire extended cochlea.",Human
A power-law distance-dependent biased random walk model with a tuning parameter ($\sigma$) is introduced in which finite mean first passage times are realizable if $\sigma$ is less than a critical value $\sigma_c$. We perform numerical simulations in $1$-dimension to obtain $\sigma_c \sim 1.14$. The three-dimensional version of this model is related to the phenomenon of chemotaxis. Diffusiophoretic theory supplemented with coarse-grained simulations establish the connection with the specific value of $\sigma = 2$ as a consequence of in-built solvent diffusion. A variant of the one-dimensional power-law model is found to be applicable in the context of a stock investor devising a strategy for extricating their portfolio out of loss.,Human
"Simplest extensions of single particle dynamics in momentum conserving active fluid - that of an active suspension of two colloidal particles or a single particle confined by a wall - exhibit strong departures from Boltzmann behavior, resulting in either a breakdown of an effective temperature description or a steady state with nonzero entropy production rate. This is a consequence of hydrodynamic interactions that introduce multiplicative noise in the stochastic description of the particle positions. This results in fluctuation induced interactions that depend on distance as a power law. We find that the dynamics of activated colloids in a passive fluid, with stochastic forcing localized on the particle, is different from that of passive colloids in an active fluctuating fluid.",Human
"We extensively explore networks of weakly unbalanced, leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons for different coupling strength, connectivity, and by varying the degree of refractoriness, as well as the delay in the spike transmission. We find that the neural network does not only exhibit a microscopic (single-neuron) stochastic-like evolution, but also a collective irregular dynamics (CID). Our analysis is based on the computation of a suitable order parameter, typically used to characterize synchronization phenomena and on a detailed scaling analysis (i.e. simulations of different network sizes). As a result, we can conclude that CID is a true thermodynamic phase, intrinsically different from the standard asynchronous regime.",Human
"A very stable binding site for the interaction between an pentameric oligothiophene and an amyloid-$\beta$(1-42) fibril has been identified by means of non-biased molecular dynamics simulations. In this site, the probe is locked in an all-trans conformation with a Coulombic binding energy of 1,200 kJ/mol due to the interactions between the anionic carboxyl groups of the probe and the cationic $\epsilon$-amino groups in the lysine side chain. Upon binding, the conformationally restricted probes show a pronounced increase in molecular planarity. This is in-line with the observed changes in luminescence properties that serve as the foundation for their use as biomarkers.",Human
"The aim of this work is to investigate the optimal vaccine sharing between two SIR centers in the presence of migration fluxes of susceptibles and infected individuals during the mumps outbreak. Optimality of the vaccine allocation means the minimization of the total number of lost working days during the whole period of epidemic outbreak $[0,t_f]$, which can be described by the functional $Q=\int_0^{t_f}I(t){\rm d}t$ where $I(t)$ stands for the number of infectives at time $t$. We explain the behavior of the optimal allocation, which depends on the model parameters and the amount of available vaccine.",Human
"Phase microscopy is an invaluable tool in the biosciences and in clinical diagnostics. The sensitivity of current phase microscopy techniques is optimized for one specific mean phase value and varies significantly across a given sample. Here, we demonstrate a technique based on wavefront shaping that optimizes the sensitivity across the field of view and for arbitrary phase objects. A significant mean sensitivity enhancement is achieved, both for engineered test samples, as well as for red blood cells. Besides sensitivity enhancement, the technique homogenizes sensitivity, reduces typical phase imaging artifacts such as halos, and allows for quantitative single-frame microscopy, which potentially allows for imaging speedup as compared to other phase stepping techniques.",Human
Many bacterial species exchange signaling molecules to coordinate population-wide responses. For this process known as quorum sensing the concentration of the respective molecules is crucial. Here we consider the interaction between spatially distributed bacterial colonies so that the spreading of the signaling molecules in space becomes important. The exponential growth of the signal-producing populations and the corresponding increase in signaling molecule production result in an exponential concentration profile that spreads with uniform speed. The theoretical predictions are supported by experiments with different strains of the soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti that display fluorescence when either producing or responding to the signaling molecules.,Human
"Mechanical forces influence the dynamics of growing tissues. Computer simulations are employed to study the importance of interfacial effects in tissue competition. It was speculated that mechanical pressure determines the competition, where the determining quantity is the homeostatic pressure - the pressure where division and apoptosis balance; the tissue with the higher homeostatic pressure overwhelms the other. Surprisingly, a weaker tissue can persist in stable coexistence with a stronger tissue, if adhesion between them is small enough. An analytic continuum description can quantitatively describe the underlying mechanism and reproduce the resulting pressures and cell-number fractions. Computer simulations furthermore display a variety of coexisting structures, ranging from spherical inclusions to a bicontinuous state.",Human
"We study the folding of RNA secondary structures with quenched sequence randomness by means of the constrained annealing method. A thermodynamic phase transition is induced by including the conformational weight of loop structures. In addition to the expected melting at high temperature, a cold melting transition appears. Our results suggest that the cold denaturation of RNA found experimentally is, in fact, a continuous phase transition triggered by quenched sequence disorder. We calculate both hot and cold melting critical temperatures for the competing energy scenario between favorable and unfavorable base pairs and present a phase diagram as a function of the loop exponent and temperature.",Human
"Realistic human contact networks capable of spreading infectious disease, for example studied in social contact surveys, exhibit both significant degree heterogeneity and clustering, both of which greatly affect epidemic dynamics. To understand the joint effects of these two network properties on epidemic dynamics, the effective degree model of Lindquist et al. is reformulated with a new moment closure to apply to highly clustered networks. A simulation study comparing alternative ODE models and stochastic simulations is performed for SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) epidemic dynamics, including a test for the conjectured error behaviour in Pellis et al., providing evidence that this novel model can be a more accurate approximation to epidemic dynamics on complex networks than existing approaches.",Human
"Extreme deformations of the DNA double helix attracted a lot of attention during the past decades. Particularly, the determination of the persistence length of DNA with extreme local disruptions, or kinks, has become a crucial problem in the studies of many important biological processes. In this paper we review an approach to calculate the persistence length of the double helix by taking into account the formation of kinks of arbitrary configuration. The reviewed approach improves the Kratky--Porod model to determine the type and nature of kinks that occur in the double helix, by measuring a reduction of the persistence length of the kinkable DNA.",Human
"Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be able to reach sampling in the second timescale within five years, producing petabytes of simulation data at current force field accuracy. Notwithstanding this, MD will still be in the regime of low-throughput, high-latency predictions with average accuracy. We envisage that machine learning (ML) will be able to solve both the accuracy and time-to-prediction problem by learning predictive models using expensive simulation data. The synergies between classical, quantum simulations and ML methods, such as artificial neural networks, have the potential to drastically reshape the way we make predictions in computational structural biology and drug discovery.",Human
"This paper investigates the dynamics of immune response and autoimmunity with particular emphasis on the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs), T cells with different activation thresholds, and cytokines in mediating T cell activity. Analysis of the steady states yields parameter regions corresponding to regimes of normal clearance of viral infection, chronic infection, or autoimmune behaviour, and the boundaries of stability and bifurcations of relevant steady states are found in terms of system parameters. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate different dynamical scenarios, and to identify basins of attraction of different steady states and periodic solutions, highlighting the important role played by the initial conditions in determining the outcome of immune interactions.",Human
"In this paper, blood and tissues samples from one normal and one thalassaemic lab-mice were studied using 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy at 78K for the first time. In contrast to human patients, these laboratory mice did not receive any medical treatment, thus the iron components present in the samples are not altered. The measured Moessbauer spectra of the blood, liver and spleen samples of the thalassaemic mouse were found to be different in the shape and iron content as compared to the corresponding spectra of the normal mouse. This result demonstrates the further exploitation of the thalassaemic mouse model to study thalassaemia in more details by means of Moessbauer spectroscopy.",Human
"Neural field theory is used to quantitatively analyze the two-dimensional spatiotemporal correlation properties of gamma-band (30 -- 70 Hz) oscillations evoked by stimuli arriving at the primary visual cortex (V1), and modulated by patchy connectivities that depend on orientation preference (OP). Correlation functions are derived analytically under different stimulus and measurement conditions. The predictions reproduce a range of published experimental results, including the existence of two-point oscillatory temporal cross-correlations with zero time-lag between neurons with similar OP, the influence of spatial separation of neurons on the strength of the correlations, and the effects of differing stimulus orientations.",Human
"We study the competition for space between two cell lines that differ only in the expression of the Ras oncogene. The two cell populations are initially separated and set to migrate antagonistically towards an in-between stripe of free substrate. After contact, their interface moves towards the population of normal cells. We interpret the velocity and traction force data taken before and after contact thanks to a hydrodynamic description of collectively migrating cohesive cell sheets. The kinematics of cells, before and after contact, allows us to estimate the relative material parameters for both cell lines. As predicted by the model, the transformed cell population with larger collective stresses pushes the wild type cell population.",Human
"It was observed before that due to convergence in the olfactory system a possible amplification can be as large as the degree of convergence. This is in the case when a single impulse from the converging inputs is enough to trigger the secondary neuron. On the other hand, if a number of impulses are required for triggering, a gain in discriminating ability may be obtained along with decrease in sensitivity gained due to the convergence. We discuss this trade-off in terms of concrete estimates using olfactory sensory neuron and the set of its receptor proteins as an example of system with convergence.",Human
"We propose a unifying theoretical framework for the analysis of first-passage time distributions in two important classes of stochastic processes in which the diffusivity of a particle evolves randomly in time. In the first class of ""diffusing diffusivity"" models, the diffusivity changes continuously via a prescribed stochastic equation. In turn, the diffusivity switches randomly between discrete values in the second class of ""switching diffusion"" models. For both cases, we quantify the impact of the diffusivity dynamics onto the first-passage time distribution of a particle via the moment-generating function of the integrated diffusivity. We provide general formulas and some explicit solutions for some particular cases of practical interest.",Human
"We study an abstracted model of neuronal activity via numerical simulation, and report spatiotemporal pattern formation and critical like dynamics. A population of pulse coupled, discretised, relaxation oscillators is simulated over networks with varying edge density and spatial embedded ness. For intermediate edge density and sufficiently strong spatial embeddedness, we observe a novel spatiotemporal pattern in the field of oscillator phases, visually resembling the surface of a frothing liquid. Increasing the edge density results in critical dynamics, with the distribution of neuronal avalanche sizes following a power law with exponent one. Further increase of the edge density results in metastable behaviour between pattern formation and synchronisation, before transitioning the system entirely into synchrony.",Human
"Reaction currents in chemical networks usually increase when increasing their driving affinities. But far from equilibrium the opposite can also happen. We find that such negative differential response (NDR) occurs in reaction schemes of major biological relevance, namely, substrate inhibition and autocatalysis. We do so by deriving the full counting statistics of two minimal representative models using large deviation methods. We argue that NDR implies the existence of optimal affinities that maximize the robustness against environmental and intrinsic noise at intermediate values of dissipation. An analogous behavior is found in dissipative self-assembly, for which we identify the optimal working conditions set by NDR.",Human
"We review the key role played by mathematical modelling in elucidating two centre-finding patterning systems in E. coli: midcell division positioning by the MinCDE system and DNA partitioning by the ParABS system. We focus particularly on how, despite much experimental effort, these systems were simply too complex to unravel by experiments alone, and instead required key injections of quantitative, mathematical thinking. We conclude the review by analysing the frequency of modelling approaches in microbiology over time. We find that while such methods are increasing in popularity, they are still probably heavily under-utilised for optimal progress on complex biological questions.",Human
"Tandem-duplication-random-loss (TDRL) is an important genome rearrangement operation studied in evolutionary biology. This paper investigates some of the formal properties of TDRL operations on the symmetric group (the space of permutations over an $ n $-set). In particular, the cardinality of `balls' of radius one in the TDRL metric, as well as the cardinality of the maximum intersection of two such balls, are determined. The corresponding problems for the so-called mirror (or palindromic) TDRL rearrangement operations are also solved. The results represent an initial step in the study of error correction and reconstruction problems in this context and are of potential interest in DNA-based data storage applications.",Human
"Cortical folding pattern is a main characteristic of the geometry of the human brain which is formed by gyri (ridges) and sulci (grooves). Several biological hypotheses have suggested different mechanisms that attempt to explain the development of cortical folding and its abnormal evolutions. Based on these hypotheses, biomechanical models of cortical folding have been proposed. In this work, we compare biomechanical simulations for several initial conditions by using an adaptive spherical parameterization approach. Our approach allows us to study and explore one of the most potential sources of reproducible cortical folding pattern: the specification of initial geometry of the brain.",Human
"Quantitative studies of cell metabolism are often based on large chemical reaction network models. A steady state approach is suited to analyze phenomena on the timescale of cell growth and circumvents the problem of incomplete experimental knowledge on kinetic laws and parameters, but it shall be supported by a correct implementation of thermodynamic constraints. In this article we review the latter aspect highlighting its computational challenges and physical insights. The simple introduction of Gibbs inequalities avoids the presence of unfeasible loops allowing for correct timescale analysis but leads to possibly non-convex feasible flux spaces, whose exploration needs efficient algorithms. We shorty review on the implementation of thermodynamics through variational principles in constraints based models of metabolic networks.",Human
"We present a Bayesian hierarchical multi-view mixture model termed Symphony that simultaneously learns clusters of cells representing cell types and their underlying gene regulatory networks by integrating data from two views: single-cell gene expression data and paired epigenetic data, which is informative of gene-gene interactions. This model improves interpretation of clusters as cell types with similar expression patterns as well as regulatory networks driving expression, by explaining gene-gene covariances with the biological machinery regulating gene expression. We show the theoretical advantages of the multi-view learning approach and present a Variational EM inference procedure. We demonstrate superior performance on both synthetic data and real genomic data with subtypes of peripheral blood cells compared to other methods.",Human
"We investigate the movement patterns of three different Neotropical marsupials in an unfamiliar and risky environment. Animals are released in a matrix from which they try to reach a patch of forest. Their movements, performed on a small spacial scale, are best approximated by L\'evy flights. Patterns of oriented and non-oriented individuals - with forest patches within or beyond their perceptual range - differ only slightly in the value of their exponents. These facts suggest that, for these species, the appearance of L\'evy flights is the product of animals innate behaviour that emerges spontaneously, as a neutral characteristic proper of a default movement mode for alerted animals.",Human
"In this work, wild-type and heterozygous \b{eta}-thalassaemic mice were enriched with 57Fe through gastrointestinal absorption to characterize in more details the iron complexes appeared in the measured Mossbauer spectra. The 57Fe enrichment method was validated and Mossbauer spectra were obtained at 80K from blood samples from wild-type and \b{eta}-thalassaemic mice at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months of age. As expected, the haemoglobin levels of the thalassaemic mice were lower than from normal mice indicating anaemia. Furthermore, significant amounts of ferritin-like iron were observed in the thalassaemic mice samples, which decreased with mouse age, reflecting the pattern of reticulocyte count reduction reported in the literature.",Human
"The original Hardenberg's model of biomass patterns in arid and semi-arid regions is revisited to extend it to more general non flat regions. It is proposed a technique to study these more generalized (non-flat) regions using both a conservation criterion and a explicit spatial dependent function $\nu (x)$. In this paper a study of dynamical stability around system's fixed points made. Under the idea of predictability via air images a fitted relationship among dynamical variables at stable fixed points is stablished. Also, is presented a discrete version of the model, in the form of Cellular Automata techniques, that allows to neglect the spatial scale and reproduces realistic stable spatial patterns.",Human
We show how to recover complete positivity (and hence positivity) of the Redfield equation via a coarse grain average technique. We derive general bounds for the coarse graining time scale above which the positivity of the Redfield equation is guaranteed. It turns out that a coarse grain time scale has strong impact on the characteristics of the Lamb shift term and implies in general non-commutation between the dissipating and the Hamiltonian components of the generator of the dynamical semi-group. Finally we specify the analysis to a two-level system or a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a fermionic or bosonic thermal environment via dipole-like interaction.,Human
"The circadian clock is the molecular mechanism responsible for the adaptation to daily rhythms in living organisms. Oscillations and fluctuations in environmental conditions regulate the circadian clock through signaling pathways. We study the response to continuous photic perturbations in a minimal molecular network model of the circadian clock, composed of 5 nonlinear delay differential equations with multiple feedbacks. We model the perturbation as a stationary stochastic process, and we consider the resulting irreversibility of trajectories as a key effect of the interaction. In particular we adopt a measure of mutual mapping irreversibility in the time series thermodynamics framework, and we find 12 hours harmonics.",Human
"Following the ideas of Davydov's soliton theory, we study the bio-energy transport in protein molecules. By using a quantum Brownian motion model for a phonon dressed vibrational exciton, we calculate the time-dependence on the mean square distance, diffusion coefficient, and energy of the vibrational exciton. We find the time-dependence by solving the quantum Langevin equation and find oscillatory behaviors due to the super-diffusive non-ohmic dissipation. We find that the vibrational exciton gains an overall energy due to the coupling to the phonon bath; it also dissipates its energy to the environment as it propagates. The amount of energy gain and the oscillatory features depend on both temperature and the phonon-vibron coupling.",Human
"Translating the vast data generated by genomic platforms into reliable predictions of clinical outcomes remains a critical challenge in realizing the promise of genomic medicine largely due to small number of independent samples. In this paper, we show that neural networks can be trained to predict clinical outcomes using heterogeneous genomic data sources via multi-task learning and adversarial representation learning, allowing one to combine multiple cohorts and outcomes in training. We compare our proposed method to two baselines and demonstrate that it can be used to help mitigate the data scarcity and clinical outcome censorship in cancer genomics learning problems.",Human
"Most known proteins in nature consist of multiple domains. Interactions between domains may lead to unexpected folding and misfolding phenomena. This study of human {\gamma}D-crystallin, a two-domain protein in the eye lens, revealed one such surprise: conformational catalysis of misfolding via intermolecular domain interface ''stealing''. An intermolecular interface between the more stable domains outcompetes the native intramolecular domain interface. Loss of the native interface in turn promotes misfolding and subsequent aggregation, especially in cataract-related {\gamma}D-crystallin variants. This phenomenon is likely a contributing factor in the development of cataract disease, the leading worldwide cause of blindness. However, interface stealing likely occurs in many proteins composed of two or more interacting domains.",Human
"Structured RNA plays many functionally relevant roles in molecular life. Structural information, while required to understand the functional cycles in detail, is challenging to gather. Computational methods promise to complement experimental efforts by predicting three-dimensional RNA models. Here, we provide a concise view of the state of the art methodologies with a focus on the strengths and the weaknesses of the different approaches. Furthermore, we analyzed the recent developments regarding the use of coevolutionary information and how it can boost the prediction performances. We finally discuss some open perspectives and challenges for the near future in the RNA structural stability field.",Human
"Machine learning provides a broad framework for addressing high-dimensional prediction problems in classification and regression. While machine learning is often applied for imaging problems in medical physics, there are many efforts to apply these principles to biological data towards questions of radiation biology. Here, we provide a review of radiogenomics modeling frameworks and efforts towards genomically-guided radiotherapy. We first discuss medical oncology efforts to develop precision biomarkers. We next discuss similar efforts to create clinical assays for normal tissue or tumor radiosensitivity. We then discuss modeling frameworks for radiosensitivity and the evolution of machine learning to create predictive models for radiogenomics.",Human
"Using a Multi-agent systems paradigm, the present project develops, validates and exploits a computational $\textit{testbed}$ that simulates micro-biological complex systems, namely the aggregation patterns of the social amoeba $\textit{Dyctiostelium discoideum}$. We propose a new design and implementation for managing discrete simulations with autonomous agents on a microscopic scale, thus focusing on their social behavior and mutual interactions. Then, the dependence on the main physical variables is tested, namely density and number of amoebas; in addition, we analyze the robustness of the dynamics against various noise sources. Along with these results, we suggest a methodology for further studies that make use of our validated model.",Human
"Stochastic simulation is a widely used method for estimating quantities in models of chemical reaction networks where uncertainty plays a crucial role. However, reducing the statistical uncertainty of the corresponding estimators requires the generation of a large number of simulation runs, which is computationally expensive. To reduce the number of necessary runs, we propose a variance reduction technique based on control variates. We exploit constraints on the statistical moments of the stochastic process to reduce the estimators' variances. We develop an algorithm that selects appropriate control variates in an on-line fashion and demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on several case studies.",Human
"The celebrated Michaelis-Menten (MM) expression provides a fundamental relation between the rate of enzyme catalysis and substrate concentration. The validity of this classical expression is, however, restricted to macroscopic amounts of enzymes and substrates and, thus, to processes with negligible fluctuations. Recent experiments have measured fluctuations in the catalytic rate to reveal that the MM equation, though valid for bulk amounts, is not obeyed at the molecular level. In this mini-review, we show how new statistical measures of fluctuations in the catalytic rate identify a regime in which the MM equation is always violated. This regime, characterized by temporal correlations between enzymatic turnovers, is absent for a single enzyme and unobservably short in the classical limit.",Human
In our article we present a computational model for the simulation of self-propelled anisotropic bacteria. To this end we use a self-propelled particle model and augment it with a statistical algorithm for the run-and-tumble motion. We derive an equation for the distribution of reorientations of the bacteria that we use to analyze the statistics of the random walk and that allows us to tune the behavior of our model to the characteristics of an E.coli bacterium. We validate our implementation in terms of a single swimmer and demonstrate that our model is capable of reproducing E.coli's run-and-tumble motion with excellent accuracy.,Human
"Experimental evidence suggests that the computational state of cortical systems change according to behavioral and stimulus context. However, it is still unknown what mechanisms underlie this adaptive processing in cortical circuitry. In this paper, we present a model of randomly coupled supercritical Andronov-Hopf oscillators which can act as an adaptive processor by exhibiting drastically different dynamics depending on the value of a single network parameter. Despite being only composed of supercritical subunits, the full system can exhibit either supercritical or subcritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. This model might provide a novel mechanism for switching between globally asymptotically stable and nonhyperbolic neural network types in pattern recognition theory.",Human
"Differential diffusion is a source of instability in population dynamics systems when species diffuse with different rates. Predator-prey systems show this instability only under certain specific conditions, usually requiring Holling-type functionals involved. Here we study the effects of intraspecific cooperation and competition on diffusion-driven instability in a predator-prey system with a different structure. We conduct the analysis on a generalized population dynamics that bounds intraspecific and interspecific interactions with Verhulst-type saturation terms instead of Holling-type functionals. We find that instability occurs due to the intraspecific saturation or intraspecific interactions, both cooperative and competitive. We present numerical simulations and show spatial patterns due to diffusion.",Human
"We derive a reduction formula for singularly perturbed ordinary differential equations (in the sense of Tikhonov and Fenichel) with a known parameterization of the critical manifold. No a priori assumptions concerning separation of slow and fast variables are made, or necessary.We apply the theoretical results to chemical reaction networks with mass action kinetics admitting slow and fast reactions. For some relevant classes of such systems there exist canonical parameterizations of the variety of stationary points, hence the theory is applicable in a natural manner. In particular we obtain a closed form expression for the reduced system when the fast subsystem admits complex balanced steady states.",Human
"There are numerous examples of natural and artificial processes that represent stochastic sequences of events followed by an absolute refractory period during which the occurrence of a subsequent event is impossible. In the simplest case of a generalized Bernoulli scheme for uniform random events followed by the absolute refractory period, the event probability as a function of time can exhibit damped transient oscillations. Using stochastically-spiking point neuron as a model example, we present an exact and compact analytical description for the oscillations without invoking the standard renewal theory. The resulting formulas stand out for their relative simplicity, allowing one to analytically obtain the amplitude damping of the 2nd and 3rd peaks of the event probability.",Human
The electrostatic interaction of metal nanoparticles with viruses is attracting great interest due to their antiviral activity and their role in enhancing the detection of viruses at ultra-low concentrations. We model the MS2 virus devoid of its single strand RNA core using a core-shell model. The dependence of the inner and outer surface charge density on the pH is taken into account in our model of the interaction. Varying the pH causes a change in the sign of the outer surface charge leading to the attractive-repulsive transition in the electrostatic interaction between the MS2 virus and metal nanoparticle at pH = 4.,Human
"Small-world structures are often used to describe structural connections in the brain. In this work, we compare the structural connection of cortical areas of a healthy brain and a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease with artificial small-world networks. Based on statistics analysis, we demonstrate that similar small-world networks can be constructed using Newman-Watts procedure. The network quantifiers of both structural matrices are identified inside the probabilistic valley. Despite of similarities between structural connection matrices and sampled small-world networks, increased assortativity can be found in the Alzheimer brain. Our results indicate that network quantifiers can be helpful to identify abnormalities in real structural connection matrices.",Human
"Engineered biomedical nanoparticles (NP) administered via intravenous routes are prone to associate to serum proteins. The protein corona can mask the NP surface functionalization and hamper the delivery of the NP to its biological target. The design of corona-free NPs relies on our understanding of the chemical-physical features of the NP surface driving the interaction with serum proteins. Here we address, by computational means, the interaction between human serum albumin (HSA) and a prototypical monolayer-protected Au nanoparticle. We show that both the chemical composition (charge, hydrophobicity) and the conformational preferences of the ligands decorating the NP surface affect the NP propensity to bind HSA.",Human
"Systems biology and whole-cell modelling are demanding increasingly comprehensive mathematical models of cellular biochemistry. These models require the development of simplified models of specific processes which capture essential biophysical features but without unnecessarily complexity. Recently there has been renewed interest in thermodynamically-based modelling of cellular processes. Here we present an approach to developing of simplified yet thermodynamically consistent (hence physically plausible) models which can readily be incorporated into large scale biochemical descriptions but which do not require full mechanistic detail of the underlying processes. We illustrate the approach through development of a simplified, physically plausible model of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and show that the simplified model behaves like the full system.",Human
"The discovery of genomic polymorphisms influencing gene expression (also known as expression quantitative trait loci or eQTLs) can be formulated as a sparse Bayesian multivariate/multiple regression problem. An important aspect in the development of such models is the implementation of bespoke inference methodologies, a process which can become quite laborious, when multiple candidate models are being considered. We describe automatic, black-box inference in such models using Stan, a popular probabilistic programming language. The utilisation of systems like Stan can facilitate model prototyping and testing, thus accelerating the data modelling process. The code described in this chapter can be found at https://github.com/dvav/eQTLBookChapter.",Human
"Cells estimate concentrations of chemical ligands in their environment using a limited set of receptors. Recent work has shown that the temporal sequence of binding and unbinding events on just a single receptor can be used to estimate the concentrations of multiple ligands. Here, for a network of many ligands and many receptors, we show that such temporal sequences can be used to estimate the concentration of a few times as many ligand species as there are receptors. Crucially, we show that the spectrum of the inverse covariance matrix of these estimates has several universal properties, which we trace to properties of Vandermonde matrices. We argue that this can be used by cells in realistic biochemical decoding networks.",Human
"We present our findings on the changes to electroosmotic flow outside glass nanopores with respect to the choice of Group 1 cation species. In contrast with standard electrokinetic theory, flow reversal was observed for all salts under a negative driving voltage. Moving down Group 1 resulted in weaker flow when the driving voltage was negative, in line with the reduction in the zeta potential on the glass surface going down the periodic table. No trend emerged with a positive driving voltage, however for Cs, flow was uniquely found to be in reverse. These results are explained by the interplay between the flow inside the nanopore and flow along the outer walls in the vicinity of the nanopore.",Human
"There has been a consistent growth in research involving imaging of microvasculature over the past few decades. By 2008, publications mentioning the microcirculation had grown more than 2000 per annum. Many techniques have been demonstrated for measurement of the microcirculation ranging from the earliest invasive techniques to the present high speed, high resolution non-invasive imaging techniques. Understanding the microvasculature is vital in tackling fundamental research questions as well as to understand effects of disease progression on the physiological wellbeing of an individual. We have previously provided a wide ranging review [38] covering most of the available techniques and their applications. In this review, we discuss the recent advances made and applications in the field of microcirculation imaging.",Human
"Artificially engineered biosensors are highly inefficient in accurately measuring the concentration of biomarkers, particularly, during early diagnosis of diseases. On the other hand, single cellular systems such as chemotactic bacteria can sense their environment with extraordinary precision. Therefore, one would expect that implementing the optimal cellular sensing strategies in state-of-the-art artificial sensors can produce optimally precise biosensors. However because of the presence of measurement noise, strategies that are optimal in biological systems may not be optimal in artificial systems. Therefore, mimicking biological strategies may not be the optimal path in case of artificial sensing systems because of the presence of inherent measurement noise.",Human
"Since the advent of optogenetics, technology development has focused on new methods to optically interact with single nervous cells. This gave rise to the field of photonic neural interfaces, intended as the set of technologies that can modify light radiation in either a linear or non-linear fashion to control and/or monitor cellular functions. These include the use of plasmonic effects, up-conversion, electron transfer and integrated light steering, with some of them already implemented in vivo. This article will review available approaches in this framework, with a particular emphasis on methods operating at the single-unit level or having the potential to reach single-cell resolution.",Human
"In the present contribution three means of measuring the geometrical and topological complexity of photons' paths in random media are proposed. This is realized by investigating the behavior of the average crossing number, the mean writhe, and the minimal crossing number of photons' paths generated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, for different sets of optical parameters. It is observed that the complexity of the photons' paths increases for increasing light source/detector spacing, and that highly ""knotted"" paths are formed. Due to the particular rules utilized to generate the MC photons' paths, the present results may have an interest not only for the biomedical optics community, but also from a pure mathematical point of view.",Human
"Understanding the geometry and topology of configuration or conformational spaces of molecules has relevant applications in chemistry and biology such as the proteins folding problem, drug design and the structure activity relationship problem. Despite their relevance, configuration spaces of molecules are only partially understood. In this paper we discuss both theoretical and computational approaches to the configuration spaces of molecules and their associated energy landscapes. Our mathematical approach shows that when symmetries of the molecules are taken into account, configuration spaces of molecules give rise to certain principal bundles and orbifolds. We also make use of a variety of geometric and topological tools for data analysis to study the topology and geometry of these spaces.",Human
"We present a method for estimating parameters in stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks by fitting steady-state distributions using Wasserstein distances. We simulate a reaction network at different parameter settings and train a Gaussian process to learn the Wasserstein distance between observations and the simulator output for all parameters. We then use Bayesian optimization to find parameters minimizing this distance based on the trained Gaussian process. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on the three-stage model of gene expression and a genetic feedback loop for which moment-based methods are known to perform poorly. Our method is applicable to any simulator model of stochastic reaction networks, including Brownian Dynamics.",Human
"Many enzymes appear to diffuse faster in the presence of substrate and to drift either up or down a concentration gradient of their substrate. Observations of these phenomena, termed enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED) and enzyme chemotaxis, respectively, lead to a novel view of enzymes as active matter. Enzyme chemotaxis and EED may be important in biology, and they could have practical applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology. They also are of considerable biophysical interest; indeed, their physical mechanisms are still quite uncertain. This review provides an analytic summary of experimental studies of these phenomena and of the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain them, and offers a perspective of future directions for the field.",Human
"In this paper, we present an analytical modeling technique for circularly symmetric piezoelectric transducers, also called as Fresnel Lens. We also present the design of a flat/piston transducer that can generate unique acoustic wave patterns, having both converging and vortexing effects. The converging effect is generated by designing the transducer electrodes in the shapes of circular rings using Fresnel formula and exciting it with an RF signal of resonant frequency. The vortexing effect is achieved by cutting the rings to different sector angles: 90, 120, 180 and 270 degrees. We use the analytical model to simulate the performance of these transducers.",Human
"During development, embryos perform a mesmerizing choreography, which is crucial for the correct shaping, positioning and function of all organs. The cellular properties powering animal morphogenesis have been the focus of much attention. On the other hand, much less consideration has been given to the invisible engine constituted by the intercellular fluid. Cells are immersed in fluid, of which the composition and physical properties have a considerable impact on development. In this review, we revisit recent studies from the perspective of the fluid, focusing on basolateral fluid compartments and taking the early mouse and zebrafish embryos as models. These examples illustrate how the hydration levels of tissues are spatio-temporally controlled and influence embryonic development.",Human
"The clarification of the motion alignment mechanism in collective cell migration is an important issue commonly in physics and biology. In analogy with the self-propelled disk, the polarity memory effect of eukaryotic cell is a fundamental candidate for this alignment mechanism. In the present paper, we theoretically examine the polarity memory effect for the motion alignment of cells on the basis of the cellular Potts model. We show that the polarity memory effect can align motion of cells. We also find that the polarity memory effect emerges for the persistent length of cell trajectories longer than average cell-cell distance.",Human
"The ability of biological and artificial collectives to outperform solitary individuals in a wide variety of tasks depends crucially on the efficient processing of social and environmental information at the level of the collective. Here, we model collective behavior in complex environments with many potentially distracting cues. Counter-intuitively, large-scale coordination in such environments can be maximized by strongly limiting the cognitive capacity of individuals, where due to self-organized dynamics the collective self-isolates from disrupting information. We observe a fundamental trade-off between coordination and collective responsiveness to environmental cues. Our results offer important insights into possible evolutionary trade-offs in collective behavior in biology and suggests novel principles for design of artificial swarms exploiting attentional bottlenecks.",Human
"Many physical and natural systems, including the population of species, evolve in habitats with spatial stochastic variations of the individuals' motility. We study here the effect of those fluctuations on invasion and genetic loss. A Langevin equation for the \textit{position} and \textit{border} of the invasion front is obtained. A striking result is that small/large fluctuations of diffusivity suppress/intensify genetic loss. Our findings reveal the potential role of environmental fluctuations as a regulating factor for genetic loss and provide a simple explanation for the regional differences in the intensity of genetic drift observed during the final stages of human evolution and in tumor mutational landscapes.",Human
"Apart from the knots formed by the main-chain, the proteins can form numerous topological structures, when included the covalent and ion-mediated interactions. In this work, we define the protein non-trivial $\theta$-curves and identify 7 different topologies in all structures known up to date. We study the correlation of the motif with the function and organism of origin, and pointing the similarity with main-chain knots, we show that some motifs may indeed be functional. We also analyze the folding and bridge-induced stability of an exemplary protein with $\theta$-curve motif and provide a catalogue of possible $\theta$-curves in proteins.",Human
"Chimera states---the coexistence of synchrony and asynchrony in a nonlocally-coupled network of identical oscillators---are often used as a model framework for epileptic seizures. Here, we explore the dynamics of chimera states in a network of modified Hindmarsh-Rose neurons, configured to reflect the graph of the mesoscale mouse connectome. Our model produces superficially epileptiform activity converging on persistent chimera states in a large region of a two-parameter space governing connections (a) between subcortices within a cortex and (b) between cortices. Our findings contribute to a growing body of literature suggesting mathematical models can qualitatively reproduce epileptic seizure dynamics.",Human
"Dimeric molecular motors walk on polar tracks by binding and hydrolyzing one ATP per step. Despite tremendous progress, the waiting state for ATP binding in the well-studied kinesin that walks on microtubule (MT), remains controversial. One experiment suggests that in the waiting state both heads are bound to the MT, while the other shows that ATP binds to the leading head after the partner head detaches. To discriminate between these two scenarios, we developed a theory to calculate accurately several experimentally measurable quantities as a function of ATP concentration and resistive force.   In particular, we predict that measurement of the randomness parameter could discriminate between the two scenarios for the waiting state of kinesin, thereby resolving this standing controversy.",Human
"We consider certain analytical features of a stochastic model that can explain among other things competition among species and simultaneous predation on the competing species from a geometric perspective which allows for a systematic description of models admitting singular Lagrangians. The model equations are shown to admit a Jacobi Last Multiplier which in turn allows for the construction of a Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is of singular nature so that construction of the Hamiltonian via a Legendre transformation is not possible. A Hamiltonian description of the model therefore requires the introduction of Dirac brackets. Explicit results are presented for the ""Kill the winner"" model and its reductions.",Human
"Stimulated amplification of fluorescence signals is obtained under conditions which approach biocompatibility by adding NanoParticles (NPs) to an aqueous solution of fluorescein. The conditions for the stability of the suspension and optimum dye concentration are detailed, together with considerations on photobleaching and phototoxicity. A dedicated experimental setup, coupled to a specified measurement protocol, prove that it is possible to obtain gain factors up to 40, with a considerable reduction in spectral fluorescence linewidth. A pump-energy- and NP-concentration dependence of the fluorescence pulse duration is interpreted as further proof of stimulated amplification. Perspectives and possible biological applications are discussed.",Human
"Stochastic gene regulatory networks with bursting dynamics can be modeled mesocopically as a generalized density-dependent Markov chain (GDDMC) or macroscopically as a piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP). Here we prove a limit theorem showing that each family of GDDMCs will converge to a PDMP as the system size tends to infinity. Moreover, under a simple dissipative condition, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution and the exponential ergodicity for the PDMP limit via the coupling method. Further extensions and applications to single-cell stochastic gene expression kinetics and bursty stochastic gene regulatory networks are also discussed and the convergence of the stationary distribution of the GDDMC model to that of the PDMP model is also proved.",Human
"Motivated by biological membrane-containing organelles in plants and photosynthetic bacteria, we study charge regulation in a model membrane stack. Considering (de)protonation as the simplest mechanism of charge equilibration between the membranes and with the bathing environment, we uncover a symmetry-broken charge state in the stack with a quasiperiodic effective charge sequence. In the case of a monovalent bathing salt solution our model predicts complex, inhomogeneous charge equilibria depending on the strength of the (de)protonation reaction, salt concentration, intermembrane separation, and their number in the stack. Our results shed light on the basic reorganization mechanism of thylakoid membrane stacks.",Human
"An interfacial regularized Stokeslet scheme is presented to predict the motion of solid bodies (e.g. proteins or gel-phase domains) embedded within flowing lipid bilayer membranes. The approach provides a numerical route to calculate velocities and angular velocities in complex flow fields that are not amenable to simple Fax\'en-like approximations. Additionally, when applied to shearing motions, the calculations yield predictions for the effective surface viscosity of dilute rigid body-laden membranes. In the case of cylindrical proteins, effective viscosity calculations are compared to two prior analytical predictions from the literature. Effective viscosity predictions for a dilute suspension of rod-shaped objects in the membrane are also presented.",Human
"Due to over-metabolism, the tumour cells become hypoxic. To overcome this situation tumour cells secret several chemical substrates to attract nearby blood vessels towards it (angiogenesis). Transition from avascular to vascular tumour is possible with the initiation of angiogenesis. Angiogenesis also plays a crucial role to spread the cancer cells and its colonization at the distant locations of the body (metastasis). In this paper, we briefly review the processes and factors which directly affect tumour angiogenesis or may get affected by it. A model based on cellular automata is developed to demonstrate this complex process through MATLAB based simulation.",Human
"In our Brief Communication (DOI: 10.1038/s41592-018-0033-z), we presented the method SAVER for recovering true gene expression levels in noisy single cell RNA sequencing data. We evaluated the performance of SAVER, along with comparable methods MAGIC and scImpute, in an RNA FISH validation experiment and a data downsampling experiment. In a Comment [arXiv:1908.07084v1], Li & Li were concerned with the use of the downsampled datasets, specifically focusing on clustering results obtained from the Zeisel et al. data. Here, we will address these comments and, furthermore, amend the data downsampling experiment to demonstrate that the findings from the data downsampling experiment in our Brief Communication are valid.",Human
We present a generic framework for modelling three-dimensional deformable shells of active matter that captures the orientational dynamics of the active particles and hydrodynamic interactions on the shell and with the surrounding environment. We find that the cross-talk between the self-induced flows of active particles and dynamic reshaping of the shell can result in conformations that are tunable by varying the form and magnitude of active stresses. We further demonstrate and explain how self-induced topological defects in the active layer can direct the morphodynamics of the shell. These findings are relevant to understanding morphological changes during organ development and the design of bio-inspired materials that are capable of self-organisation.,Human
"Plant mechanical failure, also known as lodging, is the cause of significant and unpredictable yield losses in cereal crops. Lodging occurs in two distinct failure modes - stalk lodging and root lodging. Despite the prevalence and detrimental impact of lodging on crop yields, there is little consensus on how to phenotype plants in the field for lodging resistance and thus breed for mechanically resilient plants. This review provides an overview of field-based mechanical testing approaches to assess stalk and root lodging resistance. These approaches are placed in the context of future perspectives. Best practices and recommendations for acquiring field-based mechanical phenotypes of plants are also presented.",Human
"Molecular dynamics (MD) has become a powerful tool for studying biophysical systems, due to increasing computational power and availability of software. Although MD has made many contributions to better understanding these complex biophysical systems, there remain methodological difficulties to be surmounted. First, how to make the deluge of data generated in running even a microsecond long MD simulation human comprehensible. Second, how to efficiently sample the underlying free energy surface and kinetics. In this short perspective, we summarize machine learning based ideas that are solving both of these limitations, with a focus on their key theoretical underpinnings and remaining challenges.",Human
"Stochastic mechanics---the study of classical stochastic systems governed by things like master equations and Fokker-Planck equations---exhibits striking mathematical parallels to quantum mechanics. In this article, we make those parallels more transparent by presenting a quantum mechanics-like formalism for deriving a path integral description of systems described by stochastic differential equations. Our formalism expediently recovers the usual path integrals (the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-De Dominicis and Onsager-Machlup forms) and is flexible enough to account for different variable domains (e.g. real line versus compact interval), stochastic interpretations, arbitrary numbers of variables, explicit time-dependence, dimensionful control parameters, and more. We discuss the implications of our formalism for stochastic biology.",Human
"The tensor-structured parametric analysis (TPA) has been recently developed for simulating and analysing stochastic behaviours of gene regulatory networks [Liao et. al., 2015]. The method employs the Fokker-Planck approximation of the chemical master equation, and uses the Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) format, as a low-parametric tensor-structured representation of classical matrices and vectors, to approximate the high-dimensional stationary probability distribution. This paper presents a detailed error analysis of all approximation steps of the TPA regarding validity and accuracy, including modelling error, artificial boundary error, discretization error, tensor rounding error, and algebraic error. The error analysis is illustrated using computational examples, including the death-birth process and a 50-dimensional isomerization reaction chain.",Human
"This work is devoted to the establishment of a Poisson structure for a format of equations known as Generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. These equations, which include the classical Lotka-Volterra systems as a particular case, have been deeply studied in the literature. They have been shown to constitute a whole hierarchy of systems, the characterization of which is made in the context of simple algebra. Our main result is to show that this algebraic structure is completely translatable into the Poisson domain. Important Poisson structures features, such as the symplectic foliation and the Darboux' canonical representation, arise as result of rather simple matrix manipulations.",Human
"In biomedical applications of machine learning, relevant information often has a rich structure that is not easily encoded as real-valued predictors. Examples of such data include DNA or RNA sequences, gene sets or pathways, gene interaction or coexpression networks, ontologies, and phylogenetic trees. We highlight recent examples of machine learning models that use structure to constrain model architecture or incorporate structured data into model training. For machine learning in biomedicine, where sample size is limited and model interpretability is critical, incorporating prior knowledge in the form of structured data can be particularly useful. The area of research would benefit from performant open source implementations and independent benchmarking efforts.",Human
"Auto-regulatory feedback loops are one of the most common network motifs. A wide variety of stochastic models have been constructed to understand how the fluctuations in protein numbers in these loops are influenced by the kinetic parameters of the main biochemical steps. These models differ according to (i) which sub-cellular processes are explicitly modelled; (ii) the modelling methodology employed (discrete, continuous or hybrid); (iii) whether they can be analytically solved for the steady-state distribution of protein numbers. We discuss the assumptions and properties of the main models in the literature, summarize our current understanding of the relationship between them and highlight some of the insights gained through modelling.",Human
"The chemical birth-death process, whose chemical master equation (CME) is exactly solvable, is a paradigmatic toy problem often used to get intuition for how stochasticity affects chemical kinetics. In a certain limit, it can be approximated by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-like process which is also exactly solvable. In this paper, we use this system to showcase eight qualitatively different ways to exactly solve continuous stochastic systems: (i) integrating the stochastic differential equation; (ii) computing the characteristic function; (iii) eigenfunction expansion; (iv) using ladder operators; (v) the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-De Dominicis path integral; (vi) the Onsager-Machlup path integral; (vii) semiclassically approximating the Onsager-Machlup path integral; and (viii) approximating the solution to the corresponding CME.",Human
"Many complex systems experience damage accumulation which leads to aging, manifest as an increasing probability of system collapse with time. This naturally raises the question of how to maximize health and longevity in an aging system at minimal cost of maintenance and intervention. Here, we pose this question in the context of a simple interdependent network model of aging in complex systems, and use both optimal control theory and reinforcement learning alongside a combination of analysis and simulation to determine optimal maintenance protocols. These protocols may motivate the rational design of strategies for promoting longevity in aging complex systems with potential applications in therapeutic schedules and engineered system maintenance.",Human
"A ubiquitous way that cells share information is by exchanging molecules. Yet, the fundamental ways that this information exchange is influenced by intracellular dynamics remain unclear. Here we use information theory to investigate a simple model of two interacting cells with internal feedback. We show that cell-to-cell molecule exchange induces a collective two-cell critical point and that the mutual information between the cells peaks at this critical point. Information can remain large far from the critical point on a manifold of cellular states, but scales logarithmically with the correlation time of the system, resulting in an information-correlation time tradeoff. This tradeoff is strictly imposed, suggesting the correlation time as a proxy for the mutual information.",Human
"The purpose of this roadmap article is to draw attention to a paradigm shift in our understanding of evolution towards a perspective of ecological-evolutionary feedback, highlighted through two recent highly simplified examples of rapid evolution. The first example focuses primarily on population dynamics: anomalies in population cycles can reflect the influence of strong selection and the interplay with mutations. The second focuses primarily on the way in which ecological structure can potentially be influenced by what is arguably the most powerful source of genetic novelty: horizontal gene transfer. We review the status of rapid evolution and also enumerate the current and future challenges of achieving a full understanding of rapid evolution in all its manifestations.",Human
"3-demensional (3D) culture model is a valuable in vitro tool to study liver biology, metabolism, organogenesis, tissue morphology, drug discovery and cell-based assays. Compelling evidence suggests that cells cultured in 3D model exhibit superior liver-specific functions over the conventional 2-dimentional (2D) culture in evaluating hepatobiliary drug disposition and drug-induced hepatotoxicity due to the in vivo-like physiological condition recapitulated by 3D model technologies. We will review the attributes of 3D culture model in acquiring relevant liver phenotypes and functionalities, discuss the critical niche factors found to modulate hepatocytes and highlight recent advancements on 3D cell culture technologies to achieve next-level in vitro tool for preclinical study.",Human
"We present a novel machine learning architecture for classification suggested by experiments on olfactory systems. The network separates input stimuli, represented as spatially distinct currents, via winnerless competition---a process based on the intrinsic sequential dynamics of the neural system---then uses a support vector machine (SVM) to provide precision to the space-time separation of the output. The combined network uses biophysical models of neurons and shows high discrimination among inputs and robustness to noise. While using the SVM alone does not permit determination of the components of mixtures of classified inputs, the combined network is able to tell the precise concentrations of the constituent parts.",Human
"A computational architecture is presented, in which ""swift and fuzzy"" emotional channels guide a ""slow and precise"" decision-making channel. Reported neurobiological studies first provide hints on the representation of both emotional and cognitive dimensions across brain structures, mediated by the neuromodulation system. The related model is based on Guided Propagation Networks, the inner flows of which can be guided through modulation. A key-channel of this model grows from a few emotional cues, and is aimed at anticipating the consequences of ongoing possible actions. Current experimental results of a computer simulation show the integrated contribution of several emotional influences, as well as issues of accidental all-out emotions.",Human
"Veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) have reported auditory and visual dysfunction that persists beyond the acute incident. The etiology behind these symptoms is difficult to characterize with current clinical imaging. These functional deficits may be caused by shear injury or micro-bleeds, which can be detected with special imaging modalities. We explore these hypotheses in a pilot study of multi-parametric MRI. We extract over 1,000 imaging and clinical metrics and project them to a low-dimensional space, where we can discriminate between healthy controls and patients with mTBI. We also show correlations between the metric representations and patient symptoms.",Human
"The higher-order interactions of complex systems, such as the brain are captured by their simplicial complex structure and have a significant effect on dynamics. However, the existing dynamical models defined on simplicial complexes make the strong assumption that the dynamics resides exclusively on the nodes. Here we formulate the higher-order Kuramoto model which describes the interactions between oscillators placed not only on nodes but also on links, triangles, and so on. We show that higher-order Kuramoto dynamics can lead to an explosive synchronization transition by using an adaptive coupling dependent on the solenoidal and the irrotational component of the dynamics.",Human
"We used machine learning methods to predict NaV1.7 inhibitors and found the model RF-CDK that performed best on the imbalanced dataset. Using the RF-CDK model for screening drugs, we got effective compounds K1. We use the cell patch clamp method to verify K1. However, because the model evaluation method in this article is not comprehensive enough, there is still a lot of research work to be performed, such as comparison with other existing methods.   The target protein has multiple active sites and requires our further research. We need more detailed models to consider this biological process and compare it with the current results, which is an error in this article.   So we want to withdraw this article.",Human
"There is increasing evidence that protein binding to specific sites along DNA can activate the reading out of genetic information without coming into direct physical contact with the gene. There also is evidence that these distant but interacting sites are embedded in a liquid droplet of proteins which condenses out of the surrounding solution. We argue that droplet-mediated interactions can account for crucial features of gene regulation only if the droplet is poised at a non-generic point in its phase diagram. We explore a minimal model that embodies this idea, show that this model has a natural mechanism for self-tuning, and suggest direct experimental tests.",Human
"In recent years, the advances in single-cell RNA-seq techniques have enabled us to perform large-scale transcriptomic profiling at single-cell resolution in a high-throughput manner. Unsupervised learning such as data clustering has become the central component to identify and characterize novel cell types and gene expression patterns. In this study, we review the existing single-cell RNA-seq data clustering methods with critical insights into the related advantages and limitations. In addition, we also review the upstream single-cell RNA-seq data processing techniques such as quality control, normalization, and dimension reduction. We conduct performance comparison experiments to evaluate several popular single-cell RNA-seq clustering approaches on two single-cell transcriptomic datasets.",Human
"The genetic composition of a naturally developing population is considered as due to mutation, selection, genetic drift and recombination. Selection is modeled as single-locus terms (additive fitness) and two-loci terms (pairwise epistatic fitness). The problem is posed to infer epistatic fitness from population-wide whole-genome data from a time series of a developing population. We generate such data in silico, and show that in the Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium (QLE) phase of Kimura, Neher and Shraiman, that pertains at high enough recombination rates and low enough mutation rates, epistatic fitness can be quantitatively correctly inferred using inverse Ising/Potts methods.",Human
"This paper is concerned with an analysis of the dynamics of a non-autonomous, single population age based growth model with harvesting formulation. First, we derive sufficient conditions for permanence and positive invariance. Then, by constructing a scalar function, namely the Lyapunov function, we arrive at a suitable criterion for global attractivity. With the help of Brouwer fixed point and continuation theorems, we obtain constraints for the existence of a positive periodic solution. Then we prove that there exists only one solution which is almost periodic in nature that is distinct from every other solution. Further, we carry out a numerical simulation to support the analytical findings.",Human
"The theory of multistate template-directed reversible copolymerization is developed by extending the method based on iterated function systems to matrices, taking into account the possibility of multiple activation states instead of a single one for the growth process. In this extended theory, the mean growth velocity is obtained with an iterated matrix function system and the probabilities of copolymer sequences are given by matrix products defined along the template. The theory allows us to understand the effects of template heterogeneity, which include a fractal distribution of local growth velocities far enough from equilibrium, and a regime of sublinear growth in time close to equilibrium.",Human
"Fast confocal imaging was achieved by combining remote focusing with differential spinning disk optical sectioning to rapidly acquire images of live samples at cellular resolution. Axial and lateral full width half maxima less than 5 um and 490 nm respectively are demonstrated over 130 um axial range with a 256 x 128 um field of view. A water-index calibration slide was used to achieve an alignment that minimises image volume distortion. Application to live biological samples was demonstrated by acquiring image volumes over a 24 um axial range at 1 volume/s, allowing for the detection of calcium-based neuronal activity in Platynereis dumerilii larvae.",Human
"Many complex systems, ranging from migrating cells to animal groups, exhibit stochastic dynamics described by the underdamped Langevin equation. Inferring such an equation of motion from experimental data can provide profound insight into the physical laws governing the system. Here, we derive a principled framework to infer the dynamics of underdamped stochastic systems from realistic experimental trajectories, sampled at discrete times and subject to measurement errors. This framework yields an operational method, Underdamped Langevin Inference (ULI), which performs well on experimental trajectories of single migrating cells and in complex high-dimensional systems, including flocks with Viscek-like alignment interactions. Our method is robust to experimental measurement errors, and includes a self-consistent estimate of the inference error.",Human
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive and label-free technique widely used in medical diagnosis and life science research, and its success has benefited greatly from continuing efforts on enhancing contrast and resolution. Here we reported nanoscale MRI in a single cell using an atomic-size quantum sensor. With nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, the intracellular protein ferritin has been imaged with a spatial resolution of ~ 10 nanometers, and ferritin-containing organelles were co-localized by correlative MRI and electron microscopy. Comparing to the current micrometer resolution in current state-of-art conventional MRI, our approach represents a 100-fold enhancement, and paves the way for MRI of intracellular proteins.",Human
"How much information is transmitted when animals use emotions to communicate? It is clear that emotions are used as communication systems in humans and other species. The quantitative theory of emotion information presented here is based on Shannon's mathematical theory of information in communication systems. The theory explains myriad aspects of emotion communication and offers dozens of new directions for research. It is superior to the ""contagion"" theory of emotion spreading, which is currently dominant. One important application of the information theory of emotion communication is that it permits the development of emotion security systems for social networks to guard against the widespread emotion manipulation we see online today.",Human
"We study steady-state properties of a bath of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in two dimensions in the presence of two fixed, permeable (hollow) disklike inclusions, whose interior and exterior regions can exhibit mismatching motility (self-propulsion) strengths for the ABPs. We show that such a discontinuous motility field strongly affects spatial distribution of ABPs and thus also the effective interaction mediated between the inclusions through the active bath. Such net interactions arise from soft interfacial repulsions between ABPs that sterically interact with and/or pass through permeable membranes assumed to enclose the inclusions. Both regimes of repulsion and attractive (albeit with different mechanisms) are reported and summarized in overall phase diagrams.",Human
"This is a living document that will be updated when appropriate. MIIND [1, 2] is a population-level neural simulator. It is based on population density techniques, just like DIPDE [3]. Contrary to DIPDE, MIIND is agnostic to the underlying neuron model used in its populations so any 1, 2 or 3 dimensional model can be set up with minimal effort. The resulting populations can then be grouped into large networks, e.g. the Potjans-Diesmann model [4]. The MIIND website http://miind.sf.net contains training materials, and helps to set up MIIND, either by using virtual machines, a DOCKER image, or directly from source code.",Human
"The cell cycle duration is a variable cellular phenotype that underlies long-term population growth and age structures. By analyzing the stationary solutions of a branching process with heritable cell division times, we demonstrate existence of a phase transition, which can be continuous or first-order, by which a non-zero fraction of the population becomes localized at a minimal division time. Just below the transition, we demonstrate coexistence of localized and delocalized age-structure phases, and power law decay of correlation functions. Above it, we observe self-synchronization of cell cycles, collective divisions, and slow 'aging' of population growth rates.",Human
Current protein forcefields like the ones seen in CHARMM or Xplor-NIH have many terms that include bonded and non-bonded terms. Yet the forcefields do not take into account the use of hydrogen bonds which are important for secondary structure creation and stabilization of proteins. SCOPE is an open-source program that generates proteins from rotamer space. It then creates a forcefield that uses only non-bonded and hydrogen bond energy terms to create a profile for a given protein. The profiles can then be used in an artificial neural network to create a linear model that is funneled to the true protein conformation.,Human
"We propose a change of variable approach and discontinuity capturing methods to ensure physical constraints for advection-reaction equations discretized by the finite element method. This change of variable confines the concentration below an upper bound in a very natural way. For the non-negativity constraint, we propose to use a discontinuity capturing method defined on the reference element that is combined with an anisotropic crosswind-dissipation operator. This discontinuity capturing cannot completely eliminate negative values but effectively minimizes their occurrence. The proposed methods are applied to different biophysical models and show a good agreement with experimental results for the FDA benchmark blood pump for a physiological red blood cell pore formation model.",Human
"Using a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) meta-population model of disease transmission, we present analytical calculations and numerical simulations dissecting the interplay between stochasticity and the division of a population into mutually independent sub-populations. We show that subdivision activates two stochastic effects---extinction and desynchronization---diminishing the overall impact of the outbreak, even when the total population has already left the stochastic regime and the basic reproduction number is not altered by the subdivision. Both effects are quantitatively captured by our theoretical estimates, allowing us to determine their individual contributions to the observed reduction of the peak of the epidemic.",Human
"The relationship between microscopic observations and macroscopic behavior is a fundamental open question in biophysical systems. Here, we develop a unified approach that---in contrast with existing methods---predicts cell type from macromolecular data even when accounting for the scale of human tissue diversity and limitations in the available data. We achieve these benefits by applying a k-nearest-neighbors algorithm after projecting our data onto the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix inferred from many observations of gene expression or chromatin conformation. Our approach identifies variations in epigenotype that impact cell type, thereby supporting the cell type attractor hypothesis and representing the first step toward model-independent control strategies in biological systems.",Human
"I estimate the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The transmission rate is heterogeneous across countries and far exceeds the recovery rate, which enables a fast spread. In the benchmark model, 28% of the population may be simultaneously infected at the peak, potentially overwhelming the healthcare system. The peak reduces to 6.2% under the optimal mitigation policy that controls the timing and intensity of social distancing. A stylized asset pricing model suggests that the stock price temporarily decreases by 50% in the benchmark case but shows a W-shaped, moderate but longer bear market under the optimal policy.",Human
"Heterologous gene expression draws resources from host cells. These resources include vital components to sustain growth and replication, and the resulting cellular burden is a widely recognised bottleneck in the design of robust circuits. In this tutorial we discuss the use of computational models that integrate gene circuits and the physiology of host cells. Through various use cases, we illustrate the power of host-circuit models to predict the impact of design parameters on both burden and circuit functionality. Our approach relies on a new generation of computational models for microbial growth that can flexibly accommodate resource bottlenecks encountered in gene circuit design. Adoption of this modelling paradigm can facilitate fast and robust design cycles in synthetic biology.",Human
"We study the increases of infections and deaths in Sweden caused by COVID-19 with several different models: Firstly an analytical susceptible-infected (SI) model and the standard susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Then within the SIR framework we study the susceptible-infected-deceased (SID) correlations. All models reproduce well the number of infected cases and give similar predictions. What causes us deep concern is the large number of deaths projected by the SI and SID models. Our analysis shows that, irrespective of the possible uncertainty of our model prediction, the next few days can be critical for determining the future evolution of the death cases (Updated April 02).",Human
"We illustrate and study the evolution of reported infections over the month from March 1st to April 1st in the New York State as a whole, as well as in each individual county. We search for exponential trends, and try to understand whether there is any correlation of the timing and dynamics of these trends with state mandated measures on social distancing and testing. We conclude that the reports on April 1st may be dramatically under-representing the actual number of state-wide infections, and we propose reassessment of the data over the coming weeks, to monitor for effects of the PAUSE directive, and for the increasing number of casualties as a validating measure.",Human
"At the time of writing, Louisiana has the third highest COVID-19 infection per capita in the United States. The state government issued a stay-at-home order effective March 23rd. We analyze the projected spread of COVID-19 in Louisiana without including the effects of the stay-at-home order. We predict that a large fraction of the state population would be infected without the mitigation efforts, and would certainly overwhelm the capacity of Louisiana health care system. We further predict the outcomes with different degrees of reduction in the infection rate. More than 70% of reduction is required to cap the number of infected to under one million.",Human
"The swimming of cells, far from any boundary, can arise in the absence of long-range liquid-crystalline order within the cytoplasm, but simple models of this effect are lacking. Here we present a two-dimensional model of droplet self-propulsion involving two scalar fields, representing the cytoplasm and a contractile cortex. An active stress results from coupling between these fields; self-propulsion results when rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. The swimming speed is predicted, and shown numerically, to vary linearly with the activity parameter and with the droplet area fraction. The model exhibits a Crowley-like instability for an array of active droplets.",Human
"During the last decade, intracellular actin waves have attracted much attention due to their essential role in various cellular functions, ranging from motility to cytokinesis. Experimental methods have advanced significantly and can capture the dynamics of actin waves over a large range of spatio-temporal scales. However, the corresponding coarse-grained theory mostly avoids the full complexity of this multi-scale phenomenon. In this perspective, we focus on a minimal continuum model of activator-inhibitor type and highlight the qualitative role of mass-conservation, which is typically overlooked. Specifically, our interest is to connect between the mathematical mechanisms of pattern formation in the presence of a large-scale mode, due to mass-conservation, and distinct behaviors of actin waves.",Human
"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a devastating pandemic of COVID-19. Exploring compounds that could offer a breakthrough in treatment is the need of the hour. Re-positioning cheap, freely available and safe drugs is a priority. The paper proposes evidence for the potential use of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in the treatment of COVID-19. DEC has inhibitory effects on arachidonic acid metabolism to prostaglandins, little known anti-viral effects on animal retroviruses and demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions in animal models of lung inflammation indicating the need to explore this hypothesis further. We believe this is the first time DEC is being proposed to treat COVID-19.",Human
"L\'evy walks (LWs) are spatiotemporally coupled random-walk processes describing superdiffusive heat conduction in solids, propagation of light in disordered optical materials, motion of molecular motors in living cells, or motion of animals, humans, robots, and viruses. We here investigate a key feature of LWs, their response to an external harmonic potential. In this generic setting for confined motion we demonstrate that LWs equilibrate exponentially and may assume a bimodal stationary distribution. We also show that the stationary distribution has a horizontal slope next to a reflecting boundary placed at the origin, in contrast to correlated superdiffusive processes. Our results generalize LWs to confining forces and settle some long-standing puzzles around LWs.",Human
"Recent simulation results imply the lowering of the ground-state correlation energy per counterion at a charged planar wall, compared with that of the 2D and 3D one-component plasma systems. Our aim is to correctly evaluate the ground-state energy of strongly-coupled counterion systems by considering a quasi-2D bound state where bound counterions are confined to a layer of molecular thickness. We use a variational approach based on the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality for the lower-bound free energy so that the liquid-state theory can be incorporated into the formulations. The soft mean spherical approximation demonstrates that the lowered ground-state energy can be reproduced by the obtained analytical form of a quasi-2D bound state.",Human
"The lyric career of Maria Callas, though exceptional, is also noteworthy for its brevity. The first signs of downturn appeared at the age of 36 and her voice fell silent at only 40. Though the literature has massively commented on this premature worsening, few analyses of its characteristics have been made public so far. The purpose of our study was to realise a perceptual and acoustical analysis of recorded arias by the artist at the climax to the fall. The audible impairments were first verbally described, and then compared to acoustical observations based on spectrographic analyses and fundamental-frequency measurements.",Human
"We investigate the first-passage dynamics of symmetric and asymmetric L\'evy flights in a semi-infinite and bounded intervals. By solving the space-fractional diffusion equation, we analyse the fractional-order moments of the first-passage time probability density function for different values of the index of stability and the skewness parameter. A comparison with results using the Langevin approach to L\'evy flights is presented. For the semi-infinite domain, in certain special cases analytic results are derived explicitly, and in bounded intervals a general analytical expression for the mean first-passage time of L\'evy flights with arbitrary skewness is presented. These results are complemented with extensive numerical analyses.",Human
"Dementia is a collection of symptoms associated with impaired cognition and impedes everyday normal functioning. Dementia, with Alzheimer's disease constituting its most common type, is highly complex in terms of etiology and pathophysiology. A more quantitative or computational attitude towards dementia research, or more generally in neurology, is becoming necessary - Computational Neurology. We provide a focused review of some computational approaches that have been developed and applied to the study of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Both mechanistic modeling and data-drive, including AI or machine learning, approaches are discussed. Linkage to clinical decision support systems for dementia diagnosis will also be discussed.",Human
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Understanding the underlying gene mutations in HCC provides great prognostic value for treatment planning and targeted therapy. Radiogenomics has revealed an association between non-invasive imaging features and molecular genomics. However, imaging feature identification is laborious and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for mutation prediction in APOB, COL11A1 and ATRX genes using multiphasic CT scans. Considering intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) in HCC, multi-region sampling technology is implemented to generate the dataset for experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",Human
"A three dimensional mesoscopic model is applied to study the properties of short DNA chains in a confining environment. The cylindrical channel is represented by a hard-wall repulsive potential incorporated in the system Hamiltonian. The macroscopic helical parameters are computed performing statistical averages over the ensemble of microscopic base pair fluctuations. The average molecule elongation, measured by the end-to-end distance, is derived as a function of the channel potential parameters both for a homogeneous and a heterogeneous chain. The overall results suggest that the mesoscopic model, with the channel potential term, yields consistent quantitative estimates for the stretching and twisting of short chains.",Human
"During an infectious disease outbreak, biases in the data and complexities of the underlying dynamics pose significant challenges in mathematically modelling the outbreak and designing policy. Motivated by the ongoing response to COVID-19, we provide a toolkit of statistical and mathematical models beyond the simple SIR-type differential equation models for analysing the early stages of an outbreak and assessing interventions. In particular, we focus on parameter estimation in the presence of known biases in the data, and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in enclosed subpopulations, such as households and care homes. We illustrate these methods by applying them to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Human
"An epidemiological compartmental model was used to simulate social distancing strategies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent a second wave in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Optimization using genetic algorithm was used to determine the optimal solutions. Our results suggest the best-case strategy for Sao Paulo is to maintain or increase the current magnitude of social distancing for at least 60 more days and increase the current levels of personal protection behaviors by a minimum of 10% (e.g., wearing facemasks, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration). Followed by a long-term oscillatory level of social distancing with a stepping-down approach every 80 days over a period of two years with continued protective behavior.",Human
"The goal of this work is to study the optimal controls for the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. We consider an age-structured SEIRQ model with quarantine compartment, where the controls are the quarantine entrance parameters. We then compare the optimal controls for different quarantine lengths and distribution of the total control cost by assessing their respective reductions in deaths in comparison to the same period without quarantine. The best strategy provides a calendar of when to relax the isolation measures for each age group. Finally, we analyse how a delay in the beginning of the quarantine affects this calendar by changing the initial conditions.",Human
"Using a probability of novel encounter derived from a physical model, we augment the SIR compartmental model for disease spread. Scenarios with the same initial trajectories and identical $R_0$ values can diverge greatly depending on the speed at which our circles of acquaintances grow stale - leading to order of magnitude differences in final case counts. A momentum effect arises from variation in the mean time since infection, and this feeds back into new infection rate and faster decline in the late stages of an outbreak. Rapid extinction of an outbreak can occur in the early stages, but once this opportunity is missed the effect is diminished and then, only herd immunity can help.",Human
"The actin cortex is a thin layer of actin, myosin, and actin binding proteins that underlies the membrane of most animal cells. It is highly dynamic and can undergo remodelling on time-scales of tens of seconds thanks to protein turnover and myosin-mediated contractions. The cortex enables cells to resist external mechanical stresses, controls cell shape, and allows cells to exert forces on their neighbours. Thus, its mechanical properties are key to its physiological function. Here, we give an overview of how cortex composition, structure, and dynamics control cortex mechanics and cell shape. We use mitosis as an example to illustrate how global and local regulation of cortex mechanics give rise to a complex series of cell shape changes.",Human
"A quantitative COVID-19 model that incorporates hidden asymptomatic patients is developed, and an analytic solution in parametric form is given. The model incorporates the impact of lockdown and resulting spatial migration of population due to announcement of lockdown. A method is presented for estimating the model parameters from real-world data. It is shown that increase of infections slows down and herd immunity is achieved when symptomatic patients are 4-6\% of the population for the European countries we studied, when the total infected fraction is between 50-56 \%. Finally, a method for estimating the number of asymptomatic patients, who have been the key hidden link in the spread of the infections, is presented.",Human
"We analyze the effect of using a screening CT-scan for evaluation of potential COVID-19 infections in order to isolate and perform contact tracing based upon a viral pneumonia diagnosis. RT-PCR is then used for continued isolation based upon a COVID diagnosis. Both the low false negative rates and rapid results of CT-scans lead to dramatically reduced transmission. The reduction in cases after 60 days with widespread use of CT-scan screening compared to PCR by itself is as high as $50\times$, and the reduction of effective reproduction rate $R(t)$ is $0.20$. Our results imply that much more rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining social distancing with CT-scans and contact tracing.",Human
"The infections and fatalities due to SARS-CoV-2 virus for cases specific to India have been studied using a deterministic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD) compartmental model. One of the most significant epidemiological parameter, namely the effective reproduction number of the infection is extracted from the daily growth rate data of reported infections and it is included in the model with a time variation. We evaluate the effect of control interventions implemented till now and estimate the case numbers for infections and deaths averted by these restrictive measures. We further provide a forecast on the extent of the future Covid-19 transmission in India and predict the probable numbers of infections and fatalities under various potential scenarios.",Human
"We have modeled the metabolic process running in aerobic cells as open nonlinear dissipative systems. The map of metabolic paths and the general scheme of a dissipative system participating in the transformation of steroids are constructed. We have studied the influence of the Krebs cycle on the dynamics of the whole metabolic process and constructed projections of the phase portrait in the strange attractor mode. The total spectra of Lyapunov exponents, divergences, Lyapunov's dimensions of the fractality, Kolmogorov--Sinai entropies, and predictability horizons for the given modes are calculated. We have determined the bifurcation diagram presenting the dependence of the dynamics on a small parameter, which defines system's physical state.",Human
"Measures to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic require a mix of logistic, political and social capacity. Depending on the country, different approaches to increase hospitalization capacity or to properly apply lock-downs are observed. In order to better understand the impact of these measures we have developed a compartmental model which, on the one hand allows to calibrate the reduction of movement of people within and among different areas, and on the other hand it incorporates a hospitalization dynamics that differentiates the available kinds of treatment that infected people can receive. By bounding the hospitalization capacity, we are able to study in detail the interplay between mobility and hospitalization capacity.",Human
"Enzyme kinetics is very often characterised by the irreversible Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation. However, in open chemical reaction networks such as metabolic pathways, this approach can lead to significant kinetic and thermodynamic inconsistencies. Based on recent developments in nonequilibrium chemical thermodynamics, we present a validity criterion solely expressed in terms of the equilibrium constant of the enzyme-catalysed reaction. When satisfied, it guarantees the ability of the irreversible MM equation to generate kinetic and thermodynamic data that are quantitatively reliable for reasonable ranges of concentrations. Our validity criterion is thus a precious tool to ensure reliable kinetic and thermodynamic modelling of pathways. We also show that it correctly identifies the so-called irreversible enzymatic reactions in glycolysis and Krebs cycle.",Human
"The new corona virus disease -- COVID-2019 -- is rapidly spreading through the world. The availability of unbiased timely statistics of trends in disease events are a key to effective responses. But due to reporting delays, the most recently reported numbers are frequently underestimating of the total number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths creating an illusion of a downward trend. Here we describe a statistical methodology for predicting true daily quantities and their uncertainty, estimated using historical reporting delays. The methodology takes into account the observed distribution pattern of the lag. It is derived from the removal method, a well-established estimation framework in the field of ecology.",Human
"Time-resolved analysis of periodically excited luminescence decays by the phasor method in the presence of time-gating or binning is revisited. Analytical expressions for discrete configurations of square gates are derived and the locus of the phasors of such modified periodic single-exponential decays is compared to the canonical uni-versal semicircle. The effects of IRF offset, decay truncation and gate shape are also discussed. Finally, modified expressions for the phase and modulus lifetimes are pro-vided for some simple cases. A discussion of a modified phasor calibration approach is presented, and illustration of the new concepts with examples from the literature conclude this work.",Human
"Neural populations exposed to a certain stimulus learn to represent it better. However, the process that leads local, self-organized rules to do so is unclear. We address the question of how can a neural periodic input be learned and use the Differential Hebbian Learning framework, coupled with a homeostatic mechanism to derive two self-consistency equations that lead to increased responses to the same stimulus. Although all our simulations are done with simple Leaky-Integrate and Fire neurons and standard Spiking Time Dependent Plasticity learning rules, our results can be easily interpreted in terms of rates and population codes.",Human
"The growing literature on the propagation of COVID-19 relies on various dynamic SIR-type models (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) which yield model-dependent results. For transparency and ease of comparing the results, we introduce a common representation of the SIR-type stochastic epidemiological models. This representation is a discrete time transition model, which allows us to classify the epidemiological models with respect to the number of states (compartments) and their interpretation. Additionally, the transition model eliminates several limitations of the deterministic continuous time epidemiological models which are pointed out in the paper. We also show that all SIR-type models have a nonlinear (pseudo) state space representation and are easily estimable from an extended Kalman filter.",Human
"In this work, we present and analyse a system of coupled partial differential equations, which models tumour growth under the influence of subdiffusion, mechanical effects, nutrient supply, and chemotherapy. The subdiffusion of the system is modelled by a time fractional derivative in the equation governing the volume fraction of the tumour cells. The mass densities of the nutrients and the chemotherapeutic agents are modelled by reaction diffusion equations. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the model via the Faedo--Galerkin method and the application of appropriate compactness theorems. Lastly, we propose a fully discretised system and illustrate the effects of the fractional derivative and the influence of the fractional parameter in numerical examples.",Human
"In this paper we afford a quantitative analysis of the sustainability of current world population growth in relation to the parallel deforestation process adopting a statistical point of view. We consider a simplified model based on a stochastic growth process driven by a continuous time random walk, which depicts the technological evolution of human kind, in conjunction with a deterministic generalised logistic model for humans-forest interaction and we evaluate the probability of avoiding the self-destruction of our civilisation. Based on the current resource consumption rates and best estimate of technological rate growth our study shows that we have very low probability, less than 10% in most optimistic estimate, to survive without facing a catastrophic collapse.",Human
"We show that logic computational circuits in gene regulatory networks arise from a fibration symmetry breaking in the network structure. From this idea we implement a constructive procedure that reveals a hierarchy of genetic circuits, ubiquitous across species, that are surprising analogues to the emblematic circuits of solid-state electronics: starting from the transistor and progressing to ring oscillators, current-mirror circuits to toggle switches and flip-flops. These canonical variants serve fundamental operations of synchronization and clocks (in their symmetric states) and memory storage (in their broken symmetry states). These conclusions introduce a theoretically principled strategy to search for computational building blocks in biological networks, and present a systematic route to design synthetic biological circuits.",Human
"Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is one of the most widely used molecular graphics software in the community of theoretical simulations. So far, however, it still lacks a graphical user interface (GUI) for molecular manipulations when doing some modeling tasks. For instance, translation or rotation of a selected molecule(s) or part(s) of a molecule, which are currently only can be achieved using tcl scripts. Here, we use tcl script develop a user-friendly GUI for VMD, named Molcontroller, which is featured by allowing users to quickly and conveniently perform various molecular manipulations. This GUI might be helpful for improving the modeling efficiency of VMD users.",Human
"The outbreak of Covid-19 led the world to an unprecedent health and economical crisis. In an attempt to responde to this emergency researchers worldwide are intensively studying the Covid-19 pandemic dynamics. In this work, a SIRSi compartmental model is proposed, which is a modification of the known classical SIR model. The proposed SIRSi model considers differences in the immunization within a population, and the possibility of unreported or asymptomatic cases. The model is adjusted to three major cities of S\~ao Paulo State, in Brazil, namely, S\~ao Paulo, Santos and Campinas, providing estimates on the duration and peaks of the outbreak.",Human
"The emergence of an epidemic evokes the need to monitor its spread and assess and validate any mitigation measures enacted by governments and administrative bodies in real time. We present here a method to observe and quantify this spread and the response of affected populations and governing bodies and apply it to COVID-19 as a case study. This method provides means to simultaneously track in real time quantities such as the mortality and the recovery rates as well as the number of new infections caused by an infected person. With sufficient data, this method enables thorough monitoring and assessment of an epidemic without assumptions regarding the evolution of the pandemic in the future.",Human
"Zinc, a suspected potentiator of learning and memory, is shown to affect exocytotic release and storage in neurotransmitter-containing vesicles. Structural and size analysis of the vesicular dense core and halo using transmission electron microscopy was combined with single-cell amperometry to study the vesicle size changes induced after zinc treatment and to compare these changes to theoretical predictions based on the concept of partial release as opposed to full quantal release. This powerful combined analytical approach establishes the existence of an unsuspected strong link between vesicle structure and exocytotic dynamics which can be used to explain the mechanism of regulation of synaptic plasticity by Zn 2+ through modulation of neurotransmitter release.",Human
"Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) play important roles in various physiological processes (e.g., phagocytosis) and pathological conditions (e.g., cancer). The primary ROS/RNS, viz., hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite ion, nitric oxide, and nitrite ion, can be oxidized at different electrode potentials and therefore detected and quantified by electroanalytical techniques. Nanometer-sized electrochemical probes are especially suitable for measuring ROS/RNS in single cells and cellular organelles. In this article, we survey recent advances in localized measurements of ROS/RNS inside single cells and discuss several methodological issues, including optimization of nanoelectrode geometry, precise positioning of an electrochemical probe inside a cell, and interpretation of electroanalytical data.",Human
"Redlining is the discriminatory practice whereby institutions avoided investment in certain neighborhoods due to their demographics. Here we explore the lasting impacts of redlining on the spread of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). Using data available through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, we construct a redlining index for each NYC census tract via a multi-level logistical model. We compare this redlining index with the COVID-19 statistics for each NYC Zip Code Tabulation Area. Accurate mappings of the pandemic would aid the identification of the most vulnerable areas and permit the most effective allocation of medical resources, while reducing ethnic health disparities.",Human
"By coupling peptides with DNA tags (i.e., 'barcodes'), it is now possible to harness high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies to enable highly multiplexed peptide-based assays, which have a variety of potential applications including broad characterization of the epitopes recognized by antibodies. While the processing of HTS data, in general, is already well supported, there are very few software tools that have been developed for working with data generated in these highly-multiplexed peptide assays. In order to fill this gap, we present PepSIRF (Peptide-based Serological Immune Response Framework), which is a flexible and comprehensive software package designed specifically for the analysis of HTS data from highly-multiplexed peptide-based assays.",Human
"Nematode species are well-known for their invariant cell lineage pattern during development. Combining knowledge about the fate specification induced by asymmetric division and the anti-correlation between cell cycle length and cell volume in Caenorhabditis elegans, we propose a model to simulate lineage initiation by altering cell volume segregation ratio in each division, and quantify the derived pattern's performance in proliferation speed, fate diversity and space robustness. The stereotypic pattern in C. elegans embryo is found to be one of the most optimal solutions taking minimum time to achieve the cell number before gastrulation, by programming asymmetric division as a strategy.",Human
"regulation largely unexplored, in part due to methodological limitations. Indeed, we review evidence demonstrating that commonly used methods, such as transcriptomics, are inadequate because the variability in mRNAs coding for ribosomal proteins (RP) does not necessarily correspond to RP variability. Thus protein remodeling of ribosomes should be investigated by methods that allow direct quantification of RPs, ideally of isolated ribosomes. We review such methods, focusing on mass spectrometry and emphasizing method-specific biases and approaches to control these biases. We argue that using multiple complementary methods can help reduce the danger of interpreting reproducible systematic biases as evidence for ribosome remodeling.",Human
"Non-genetic heterogeneity is key to cellular decisions, as even genetically identical cells respond in very different ways to the same external stimulus, e.g., during cell differentiation or therapeutic treatment of disease. Strong heterogeneity is typically already observed at the level of signaling pathways that are the first sensors of external inputs and transmit information to the nucleus where decisions are made. Since heterogeneity arises from random fluctuations of cellular components, mathematical models are required to fully describe the phenomenon and to understand the dynamics of heterogeneous cell populations. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical literature on cellular signaling heterogeneity, with special focus on the TGFb/SMAD signaling pathway.",Human
The size of a probe bead reported by holographic particle characterization depends on the proportion of the surface area covered by bound target molecules and so can be used as an assay for molecular binding. We validate this technique by measuring the kinetics of irreversible binding for the antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) as they attach to micrometer-diameter colloidal beads coated with protein A. These measurements yield the antibodies' binding rates and can be inverted to obtain the concentration of antibodies in solution. Holographic molecular binding assays therefore can be used to perform fast quantitative immunoassays that are complementary to conventional serological tests.,Human
"We investigate chemo-photothermal effects of gold nanorods (GNRs) coated using mesoporous silica (mSiO2) loading doxorubicin (DOX). When the mesoporous silica layer is embedded by doxorubicin drugs, a significant change in absorption spectra enable to quantify the drug loading. We carry out photothermal experiments on saline and livers of mice having GNRs@mSiO2 and GNRs@mSiO2-DOX. We also inject the gold nanostructures into many tumor-implanted mice and use laser illumination on some of them. By measuring weight and size of tumors, the distinct efficiency of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy on treatment is determined. We experimentally confirm the accumulation of gold nanostructures in liver.",Human
"Nascent adhesions are submicron transient structures promoting the early adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. Nascent adhesions typically consist of several tens of integrins, and serve as platforms for the recruitment and activation of proteins to build mature focal adhesions. They are also associated with early stage signalling and the mechanoresponse. Despite their crucial role in sampling the local extracellular matrix, very little is known about the mechanism of their formation. Consequently, there is a strong scientific activity focused on elucidating the physical and biochemical foundation of their development and function. Precisely the results of this effort will be summarized in this article.",Human
"Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) simulations are used to model populations undergoing biological and cultural evolution in a range of fields, from biology to economics to linguistics. In this paper we present DyPy, an open source Python package that can perform evolutionary simulations for any matrix form game for three common evolutionary dynamics: Moran, Wright-Fisher and Replicator. We discuss the basic components of this package and illustrate how it can be used to run a variety of simulations. Our package allows a user to run such simulations fairly easily without much prior Python knowledge. We hope that this will be a great asset to researchers in a number of different fields.",Human
"An activated process consists of energy activation and barrier crossing; the former is a prerequisite for the latter. Barrier crossing has been studied extensively, but energy activation has been overlooked due to a lack of means to gauge its progress. We define reaction stability as the probability that reactive trajectories pass a vicinity in phase space; it enabled us to analyze energy activation of a biomolecular isomerization. This process follows a mechanism fundamentally different from presumed mechanisms in standard reaction rate theories: it features accumulation of high kinetic energy in reaction coordinates, achieved by precise synergy between them coordinated by momentum space.",Human
"Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is one of the most versatile super-resolution techniques. Yet, its application to live imaging has been so far mainly limited to fluorescent and stationary specimens. Here, we present advancements in SIM to jointly tackle all the challenges of imaging living samples, i.e., obtaining super-resolution over an undistorted wide-field while dealing with sample motion, scattering, sample-induced optical aberrations and low signal-to-noise ratio. By using adaptive optics to compensate for optical aberrations and a reconstruction algorithm tailored for a moving and thick tissue, we successfully applied SIM to in vivo retinal imaging and demonstrated structured illumination ophthalmoscopy for high contrast super-resolution in vivo imaging of the human retina.",Human
"Prenatal COVID infection is one of the worst affected and least attended aspects of the COVID-19 disease. Like other coronaviruses, CoV2 infection is anticipated to affect fetal development by maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Studies showed that higher prenatal choline level in mother's body can safeguard the developing brain of the fetus from the adverse effects of CoV2 infection. Choline is commonly used as food supplement. By virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics techniques, we have established a strong inhibitory possibility of choline for SARS $\rm{3CL^{pro}}$ protease which may provide a lead for prenatal COVID-19 treatment.",Human
"We apply topological data analysis, specifically the Mapper algorithm, to the U.S. COVID-19 data. The resulting Mapper graphs provide visualizations of the pandemic that are more complete than those supplied by other, more standard methods. They encode a variety of geometric features of the data cloud created from geographic information, time progression, and the number of COVID-19 cases. They reflect the development of the pandemic across all of the U.S. and capture the growth rates as well as the regional prominence of hot-spots. The Mapper graphs allow for easy comparisons across time and space and have the potential of becoming a useful predictive tool for the spread of the coronavirus.",Human
"Eukaryotic transcription generally occurs in bursts of activity lasting minutes to hours; however, state-of-the-art measurements have revealed that many of the molecular processes that underlie bursting, such as transcription factor binding to DNA, unfold on timescales of seconds. This temporal disconnect lies at the heart of a broader challenge in physical biology of predicting transcriptional outcomes and cellular decision-making from the dynamics of underlying molecular processes. Here, we review how new dynamical information about the processes underlying transcriptional control can be combined with theoretical models that predict not only averaged transcriptional dynamics, but also their variability, to formulate testable hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional bursting and control.",Human
"We develop an agent-based model on a network meant to capture features unique to COVID-19 spread through a small residential college. We find that a safe reopening requires strong policy from administrators combined with cautious behavior from students. Strong policy includes weekly screening tests with quick turnaround and halving the campus population. Cautious behavior from students means wearing facemasks, socializing less, and showing up for COVID-19 testing. We also find that comprehensive testing and facemasks are the most effective single interventions, building closures can lead to infection spikes in other areas depending on student behavior, and faster return of test results significantly reduces total infections.",Human
"Here we investigate translational regulation in bacteria by analyzing the distribution of start codons in fully assembled genomes. We report 36 genes (infC, rpoC, rnpA, etc.) showing a preference for non-AUG start codons in evolutionarily diverse phyla (""non-AUG genes""). Most of the non-AUG genes are functionally associated with translation, transcription or replication. In E. coli, the percentage of essential genes among these 36 is significantly higher than among all genes. Furthermore, the functional distribution of these genes suggests that non-AUG start codons may be used to reduce gene expression during starvation conditions, possibly through translational autoregulation or IF3-mediated regulation.",Human
"Recurrent respiratory symptoms are common in infants but the paucity of lung function tests suitable for routine use in infants is a widely acknowledged clinical problem. In this study we evaluated tidal breathing variability (expiratory variability index, EVI) measured at home during sleep using impedance pneumography (IP) as a marker of lower airway obstruction in 36 infants (mean age 12.8 [range 6-23] months) with recurrent respiratory symptoms. Lowered EVI was associated with lower lung function (VmaxFRC), higher asthma risk, and obstructive symptoms, but not with nasal congestion. EVI measured using IP is a potential technique for lung function testing in infants.",Human
"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a central role in cellular decision-making. Understanding their structure and how it impacts their dynamics constitutes thus a fundamental biological question. GRNs are frequently modeled as Boolean networks, which are intuitive, simple to describe, and can yield qualitative results even when data is sparse. We assembled the largest repository of expert-curated Boolean GRN models. A meta-analysis of this diverse set of models reveals several design principles. GRNs exhibit more canalization, redundancy and stable dynamics than expected. Moreover, they are enriched for certain recurring network motifs. This raises the important question why evolution favors these design mechanisms.",Human
"Photosynthesis is an important and complex physical process in nature, whose comprehensive understanding would have many relevant industrial applications, for instance in the field of energy production. In this paper we propose a quantum algorithm for the simulation of the excitonic transport of energy, occurring in the first stage of the process of photosynthesis. The algorithm takes in account the quantum and environmental effects (pure-dephasing), influencing the quantum transport. We performed quantum simulations of such phenomena, for a proof of concept scenario, in an actual quantum computer the IBM Q, of 5 qubits. We validate the results with the Haken-Str\""obl model and discuss the influence of environmental parameters on the efficiency of the energy transport.",Human
"We analyse the potential effects of lateral connectivity (amacrine cells and gap junctions) on motion anticipation in the retina. Our main result is that lateral connectivity can-under conditions analysed in the paper-trigger a wave of activity enhancing the anticipation mechanism provided by local gain control [8, 17]. We illustrate these predictions by two examples studied in the experimental literature: differential motion sensitive cells [1] and direction sensitive cells where direction sensitivity is inherited from asymmetry in gap junctions connectivity [73]. We finally present reconstructions of retinal responses to 2D visual inputs to assess the ability of our model to anticipate motion in the case of three different 2D stimuli.",Human
"There have been several documented outbreaks of COVID-19 associated with vocalization, either by speech or by singing, in indoor confined spaces. Here, we model the risk of in-room airborne disease transmission via expiratory particle emission versus the average loudness of vocalization and for variable room ventilation rates. The model indicates that a 6-decibel reduction in average vocalization intensity yields a reduction in aerosol transmission probability equivalent to doubling the room ventilation rate. The results suggest that public health authorities should consider implementing ""quiet zones"" in high-risk indoor environments, such as hospital waiting rooms or dining facilities, to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne respiratory diseases.",Human
"The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally that took place from August 7-16 was one of the largest public gatherings since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Over 460,000 visitors from across the United States travelled to Sturgis, South Dakota to attend the ten day event. Using anonymous cell phone tracking data we identify the home counties of visitors to the rally and examine the impact of the rally on the spread of COVID-19. Our baseline estimate suggests a one standard deviation increase in Sturgis attendance increased COVID-19 case growth by 1.1pp in the weeks after the rally.",Human
We study minimal mean-field models of viral drug resistance development in which the efficacy of a therapy is described by a one-dimensional stochastic resetting process with mixed reflecting-absorbing boundary conditions. We derive analytical expressions for the mean survival time for the virus to develop complete resistance to the drug. We show that the optimal therapy resetting rates that achieve a minimum and maximum mean survival times undergo a second and first-order phase transition-like behaviour as a function of the therapy efficacy drift. We illustrate our results with simulations of a population-dynamics model of HIV-1 infection.,Human
"Protein conformational fluctuations are highly complex and exhibit long-term correlations. Here, molecular dynamics simulations of small proteins demonstrate that these conformational fluctuations directly affect the protein's instantaneous diffusivity $D_I$. We find that the radius of gyration $R_g$ of the proteins exhibits $1/f$ fluctuations, that are synchronous with the fluctuations of $D_I$. Our analysis demonstrates the validity of the local Stokes-Einstein type relation $D_I\propto1/(R_g + R_0)$, where $R_0\sim0.3$ nm is assumed to be a hydration layer around the protein. From the analysis of different protein types with both strong and weak conformational fluctuations the validity of the Stokes-Einstein type relation appears to be a general property.",Human
"We propose a method to extend the fast on-the-fly weight determination scheme for simulated tempering to two-dimensional space including not only temperature but also pressure. During the simulated tempering simulation, weight parameters for temperature-update and pressure-update are self-updated independently according to the trapezoidal rule. In order to test the effectiveness of the algorithm, we applied our proposed method to a peptide, chignolin, in explicit water. After setting all weight parameters to zero, the weight parameters were quickly determined during the simulation. The simulation realised a uniform random walk in the entire temperature-pressure space.",Human
"We present a modified age-structured SIR model based on known patterns of social contact and distancing measures within Washington, USA. We find that population age-distribution has a significant effect on disease spread and mortality rate, and contribute to the efficacy of age-specific contact and treatment measures. We consider the effect of relaxing restrictions across less vulnerable age-brackets, comparing results across selected groups of varying population parameters. Moreover, we analyze the mitigating effects of vaccinations and examine the effectiveness of age-targeted distributions. Lastly, we explore how our model can applied to other states to reflect social-distancing policy based on different parameters and metrics.",Human
"The applications of terahertz (THz) radiation for plant water status monitoring require systematic studies on interaction of THz wave and plants. Here, we present theoretical investigations on scattering behavior of THz waves reflected by and transmitting through a plant leaf under different water content. A theoretical model combining integral equation and radiative transfer theory is presented to fit the measured data. Good agreement confirms the availability of the model for water status evaluation when variation of leaf thickness and surface roughness is considered. We investigate the applicability of THz waves for water status monitoring in reflection and transmission geometries under different temperatures, salinities and polarizations.",Human
"Drawing and visualisation of molecular structures are some of the most common tasks carried out in structural glycobiology, typically using various software. In this perspective article, we outline developments in the computational tools for the sketching, visualisation and modelling of glycans. The article also provides details on the standard representation of glycans, and glycoconjugates, which helps the communication of structure details within the scientific community. We highlight the comparative analysis of the available tools which could help researchers to perform various tasks related to structure representation and model building of glycans. These tools can be useful for glycobiologists or any researcher looking for a ready to use, simple program for the sketching or building of glycans.",Human
"We review the mechanism and consequences of the ""bridging-induced attraction"", a generic biophysical principle which underpins some existing models for chromosome organisation in 3-D. This attraction, which was revealed in polymer physics-inspired computer simulations, is a generic clustering tendency arising in multivalent chromatin-binding proteins, and it provides an explanation for the biogenesis of nuclear bodies and transcription factories via microphase separation. Including post-translational modification reactions involving these multivalent proteins can account for the fast dynamics of the ensuing clusters, as is observed via microscopy and photobleaching experiments. The clusters found in simulations also give rise to chromatin domains which conform well with the observation of A/B compartments in HiC experiments.",Human
"Exploiting the SIQR model for COVID-19, I show that the wavy infection curve in Japan is the result of fluctuation of policy on isolation measure imposed by the government and obeyed by citizens. Assuming the infection coefficient be a two-valued function of the number of daily confirmed new cases, I show that when the removal rate of infected individuals is between these two values, the wavy infection curve is self-organized. On the basis of the infection curve, I classify the outbreak of COVID-19 into five types and show that these differences can be related to the relative magnitude of the transmission coefficient and the quarantine rate of infected individuals.",Human
"We present a multi-scale modeling and simulation framework for low-Reynolds number hydrodynamics of shape-changing immersed objects, e.g., biological microswimmers and active surfaces. The key idea is to consider principal shape changes as generalized coordinates, and define conjugate generalized hydrodynamic friction forces. Conveniently, the corresponding generalized friction coefficients can be pre-computed and subsequently re-used to solve dynamic equations of motion fast. This framework extends Lagrangian mechanics of dissipative systems to active surfaces and active microswimmers, whose shape dynamics is driven by internal forces. As an application case, we predict in-phase and anti-phase synchronization in pairs of cilia for an experimentally measured cilia beat pattern.",Human
"Granger causality is a statistical notion of causal influence based on prediction via vector autoregression. For Gaussian variables it is equivalent to transfer entropy, an information-theoretic measure of time-directed information transfer between jointly dependent processes. We exploit such equivalence and calculate exactly the 'local Granger causality', i.e. the profile of the information transfer at each discrete time point in Gaussian processes; in this frame Granger causality is the average of its local version. Our approach offers a robust and computationally fast method to follow the information transfer along the time history of linear stochastic processes, as well as of nonlinear complex systems studied in the Gaussian approximation.",Human
"Aggregating transcriptomics data across hospitals can increase sensitivity and robustness of differential expression analyses, yielding deeper clinical insights. As data exchange is often restricted by privacy legislation, meta-analyses are frequently employed to pool local results. However, if class labels are inhomogeneously distributed between cohorts, their accuracy may drop. Flimma (https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/flimma/) addresses this issue by implementing the state-of-the-art workflow limma voom in a privacy-preserving manner, i.e. patient data never leaves its source site. Flimma results are identical to those generated by limma voom on combined datasets even in imbalanced scenarios where meta-analysis approaches fail.",Human
"In this paper, we firstly propose SQIARD and SIARD models to investigate the transmission of COVID-19 with quarantine, infected and asymptomatic infected, and discuss the relation between the respective basic reproduction number $R_0, R_Q$ and the stability of the equilibrium points of model. Secondly, after training the related data parameters, in our numerical simulations, we respectively conduct the forecast of the data of US, South Korea, Brazil, India, Russia and Italy, and the effect of prediction of the epidemic situation in each country. Furthermore, we apply US data to compare SQIARD with SIARD, and display the effects of predictions.",Human
"We report on a method that classifies heart beats according to a set of 13 classes, including cardiac arrhythmias. The method localises the QRS peak complex to define each heart beat and uses a neural network to infer the patterns characteristic of each heart beat class. The best performing neural network contains six one-dimensional convolutional layers and four dense layers, with the kernel sizes being multiples of the characteristic scale of the problem, thus resulting a computationally fast and physically motivated neural network. For the same number of heart beat classes, our method yields better results with a considerably smaller neural network than previously published methods, which renders our method competitive for deployment in an internet-of-things solution.",Human
"Genetic information and environmental factors determine the path of an individuals life and therefore, the evolution of its entire species. We have succeeded in proposing and studying a model that captures this idea. In our model, a renewable resource extended throughout the environment provides the energy necessary to sustain life, including movement and reproduction. Since the resource doesn't regrow immediately, it generates competition between individuals and therefore provides a natural selection pressure from which evolution of the genetic traits is observed. As a result of this, several phenomena characteristic of living systems emerge from this model without having to introduce them explicitly. These include speciation and punctuated equilibrium, competitive exclusion, and altruistic behaviour from selfish rules.",Human
"Mathematical and computational models can assist in gaining an understanding of cell behavior at many levels of organization. Here, we review models in the literature that focus on eukaryotic cell motility at 3 size scales: intracellular signaling that regulates cell shape and movement, single cell motility, and collective cell behavior from a few cells to tissues. We survey recent literature to summarize distinct computational methods (phase-field, polygonal, Cellular Potts, and spherical cells). We discuss models that bridge between levels of organization, and describe levels of detail, both biochemical and geometric, included in the models. We also highlight links between models and experiments. We find that models that span the 3 levels are still in the minority.",Human
"We study the stochastic dynamics of an electrolyte driven by a uniform external electric field and show that it exhibits generic scale invariance despite the presence of Debye screening. The resulting long-range correlations give rise to a Casimir-like fluctuation-induced force between neutral boundaries that confine the ions; this force is controlled by the external electric field, and it can be both attractive and repulsive with similar boundary conditions, unlike other long-range fluctuation-induced forces. This work highlights the importance of nonequilibrium correlations in electrolytes and shows how they can be used to tune interactions between uncharged biological or synthetic structures at large separations.",Human
"A formal analogy of fluctuating diffusivity to thermodynamics is discussed for messenger RNA molecules fluorescently fused to a protein in living cells. Regarding the average value of the fluctuating diffusivity of such RNA-protein particles as the analog of the internal energy, the analogs of the quantity of heat and work are identified. The Clausius-like inequality is shown to hold for the entropy associated with diffusivity fluctuations, which plays a role analogous to the thermodynamic entropy, and the analog of the quantity of heat. The change of the statistical fluctuation distribution is also examined from a geometric perspective. The present discussions may contribute to a deeper understanding of the fluctuating diffusivity in view of the laws of thermodynamics.",Human
"This book brings new mathematical rigour to the ongoing vigorous debate on how to quantify biological diversity. The question ""what is diversity?"" has surprising mathematical depth, and breadth too: this book involves parts of mathematics ranging from information theory, functional equations and probability theory to category theory, geometric measure theory and number theory. It applies the power of the axiomatic method to a biological problem of pressing concern, but the new concepts and theorems are also motivated from a purely mathematical perspective.   The main narrative thread requires no more than an undergraduate course in analysis. No familiarity with entropy or diversity is assumed.",Human
"Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) describes the phenomenon where the power of a high-frequency oscillation evolves with the phase of a low-frequency one. We propose a model that explains the emergence of PAC in two commonly-accepted architectures in the brain, namely, a high-frequency neural oscillation driven by an external low-frequency input and two interacting local oscillations with distinct, locally-generated frequencies. We further propose an interconnection structure for brain regions and demonstrate that low-frequency phase synchrony can integrate high-frequency activities regulated by local PAC and control the direction of information flow across distant regions.",Human
"In physics of living systems, a search for relationships of a few macroscopic variables that emerge from many microscopic elements is a central issue. We evolved gene regulatory networks so that the expression of target genes (partial system) is insensitive to environmental changes. Then, we found the expression levels of the remaining genes autonomously increase as a plastic response. Negative proportionality was observed between the average changes in target and remnant genes, reflecting reciprocity between the macroscopic robustness of homeostatic genes and plasticity of regulator genes. This reciprocity follows the lever principle, which was satisfied throughout the evolutionary course, imposing an evolutionary constraint.",Human
"In this letter, we study the structure-transport property relationships of small ligand intercalated DNA molecules using a multiscale modelling approach where extensive ab-initio calculations are performed on numerous MD-simulated configurations of dsDNA and dsDNA intercalated with two different intercalators, ethidium and daunomycin. DNA conductance is found to increase by one order of magnitude upon drug intercalation due to the local unwinding of the DNA base pairs adjacent to the intercalated sites which leads to modifications of the density-of-states in the near-Fermi energy region of the ligand-DNA complex. Our study suggests that the intercalators can be used to enhance/tune the DNA conductance which opens new possibilities for their potential applications in nanoelectronics.",Human
"A key question in evolution is how likely a mutant is to take over. This depends on natural selection and on stochastic fluctuations. Population spatial structure can impact mutant fixation probabilities. We introduce a model for structured populations on graphs that generalizes previous ones by making migrations independent of birth and death. We demonstrate that by tuning migration asymmetry, the star graph transitions from amplifying to suppressing natural selection. The results from our model are universal in the sense that they do not hinge on a modeling choice of microscopic dynamics or update rules. Instead, they depend on migration asymmetry, which can be experimentally tuned and measured.",Human
"Deterministic compartmental models have been used extensively in modeling epidemic propagation. These models are required to fit available data and numerical procedures are often implemented to this end. But not every model architecture is able to fit the data because the structure of the model imposes hard constraints on the solutions. We investigate in this work two such situations: first the distribution of transition times from a compartment to another may impose a variable number of intermediary states; secondly, a non-linear relationship between time-dependent measures of compartments sizes may indicate the need for structurations (i.e., considering several groups of individuals of heterogeneous characteristics).",Human
"Vivid structural colors in birds are a conspicuous and vital part of their phenotype. They are produced by a rich diversity of integumentary photonic nanostructures in skin and feathers. Unlike pigmentary coloration, whose molecular genetic basis is being elucidated, little is known regarding the pathways underpinning organismal structural coloration. Here, we review available data on the development of avian structural colors. In particular, feather photonic nanostructures are understood to be intracellularly self-assembled by physicochemical forces typically seen in soft colloidal systems. We identify promising avenues for future research that can address current knowledge gaps, which is also highly relevant for the sustainable engineering of advanced bioinspired and biomimetic materials.",Human
"The origins of spontaneous movements have been investigated in human as well as in other vertebrates. Studies have reported an increase in neuronal activity one second before the onset of a given movement: this is known as readiness potential. The mechanisms underlying this increase are still unclear. Zebrafish larva is an ideal animal model to study the neuronal basis of spontaneous movements. Because of its small size and transparency, this vertebrate is an ideal candidate to apply optical recording methods. In order to understand what neuronal activity causes the execution of a specific tail movement at a given time, we will mainly use a prediction approach.",Human
"As the large amount of sequencing data accumulated in past decades and it is still accumulating, we need to handle the more and more sequencing data. As the fast development of the computing technologies, we now can handle a large amount of data by a reasonable of time using the neural network based model. This tutorial will introduce the the mathematical model of the single cell variational inference (scVI), which use the variational auto-encoder (building on the neural networks) to learn the distribution of the data to gain insights. It was written for beginners in the simple and intuitive way with many deduction details to encourage more researchers into this field.",Human
"The present work aimed to investigate an ethnobotanical survey about Pituranthos scoparius and assess the toxicity, anti-inflammatory (in vitro, and in vivo) potential, in vitro antioxidant, and analgesic effects of stems and roots of Pituranthos scoparius. Furthermore; to isolate and elucidate the chemical constituents of the n-butanol stem extract of P. scoparius (ButE) and determine the toxicity and anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds added to the ButE. Data from an ethnopharmacological study showed that 24.47 % of people used this plant in folk medicine. Four compounds were isolated from ButE. These compounds were characterized by means of NMR and high-resolution mass spectral (HRMS) data.",Human
"Intelligence is often discussed in terms of neural networks in the cerebral cortex, whose evolution has presumably been influenced by Darwinian selection. Here we present molecular evidence that one of the many kinesin motors, Kif14, has evolved to exhibit special features in its amino acid sequence that could have evolved to improve neural networks. The improvement is quantified by comparison of Kif14 sequences for 12 species. The special feature is level sets of hydrophobic extrema in water wave profiles based on several hydropathic scales. The most effective scale is a new one based on fractals, indicative of approach of globular curvatures to self-organized criticality.",Human
"Throughout the evolution of biological species on Earth, cells and organs have developed many complex structures and processes to ensure their interactions with individual chemical molecules (small and macromolecular) and nanoscale objects result in no harm. These evolutionary mechanisms complicate our attempts to use modern nanoscale science to develop effective and efficient treatments for disease or other biological dysfunctions. Here we describe the complexity of biology on the nanoscale and the implications for the success of recently-discovered nanoscience, which has resulted in an almost infinite number of potential nanomaterials of unknown efficacy. We discuss how tools to categorize nanomaterials on the basis of structure, properties and interactions can provide insights on promising directions.",Human
"Due to the fractal nature of retinal blood vessels, the retinal fractal dimension is a natural parameter for researchers to explore and has garnered interest as a potential diagnostic tool. This review aims to summarize the current scientific evidence regarding the relationship between fractal dimension and retinal pathology and thus assess the clinical value of retinal fractal dimension. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search for research articles was conducted in several internet databases (Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus). This led to a result of 28 studies included in the final review, which were analyzed via meta-analysis to determine whether the fractal dimension changes significantly in retinal disease versus normal individuals",Human
"Current major approaches to access surface hydrophobicity include directly introducing hydrophobic nonpolar groups/molecules into surface or elaborately fabricating surface roughness. Here, for the first time, molecular dynamics simulations show an unexpected hydrophobicity with a contact angle of $82^o$ on a flexible self-assembled monolayer terminated only with two hydrophilic OH groups ($(OH)_2\!-\!SAM$). This hydrophobicity is attributed to the formation of a hexagonal-ice-like H-bonding structure in the OH matrix of $(OH)_2\!-\!SAM$, which sharply reduces the hydrogen bonds between surface and water molecules above. The unique simple interface presented here offers a significant molecular-level platform for examining the bio-interfacial interactions ranging from biomolecules binding to cell adhesion.",Human
"As 2021 dawns, the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging strongly as vaccines finally appear and hopes for a return to normalcy start to materialize. There is much to be learned from the pandemic's first year data that will likely remain applicable to future epidemics and possible pandemics. With only minor variants in virus strain, countries across the globe have suffered roughly the same pandemic by first glance, yet few locations exhibit the same patterns of viral spread, growth, and control as the state of Hawai'i. In this paper, we examine the data and compare the COVID-19 spread statistics between the counties of Hawai'i as well as examine several locations with similar properties to Hawai'i.",Human
"This paper is concerned with exploring the microscopic basis for the discrete versions of the standard replicator equation and the adjusted replicator equation. To this end, we introduce frequency-dependent selection -- as a result of competition fashioned by game-theoretic consideration -- into the Wright--Fisher process, a stochastic birth-death process. The process is further considered to be active in a generation-wise nonoverlapping finite population where individuals play a two-strategy bimatrix population game. Subsequently, connections among the corresponding master equation, the Fokker--Planck equation, and the Langevin equation are exploited to arrive at the deterministic discrete replicator maps in the limit of infinite population size.",Human
"Synchronization, cooperation, and chaos are ubiquitous phenomena in nature. In a population composed of many distinct groups of individuals playing the prisoner's dilemma game, there exists a migration dilemma: No cooperator would migrate to a group playing the prisoner's dilemma game lest it should be exploited by a defector; but unless the migration takes place, there is no chance of the entire population's cooperator-fraction to increase. Employing a randomly rewired coupled map lattice of chaotic replicator maps, modelling replication-selection evolutionary game dynamics, we demonstrate that the cooperators -- evolving in synchrony -- overcome the migration dilemma to proliferate across the population when altruism is mildly incentivized making few of the demes play the leader game.",Human
"Over the last ten years, developments in whole-brain microscopy now allow for high-resolution imaging of intact brains of small rodents such as mice. These complex images contain a wealth of information, but many neuroscience laboratories do not have all of the computational knowledge and tools needed to process these data. We review recent open source tools for registration of images to atlases, and the segmentation, visualisation and analysis of brain regions and labelled structures such as neurons. Since the field lacks fully integrated analysis pipelines for all types of whole-brain microscopy analysis, we propose a pathway for tool developers to work together to meet this challenge.",Human
We present analytical results (up to a numerical diagonalization of a real symmetric matrix) for a set of time- and ensemble-average physical observables in the non-Hookean Gaussian Network Model (GNM) - a generalization of the Rouse model to elastic networks with links with a certain degree of extensional and rotational stiffness. We focus on a set of coarse-grained observables that may be of interest in the analysis of GNM in the context of internal motions in proteins and mechanical frames in contact with a heat bath. A C++ computer code is made available that implements all analytical results.,Human
"Organ-on-a-chip (OoCs) platforms could revolutionize drug discovery and might ultimately become essential tools for precision therapy. Although many single-organ and interconnected systems have been described, the immune system has been comparatively neglected, despite its pervasive role in the body and the trend towards newer therapeutic products (i.e., complex biologics, nanoparticles, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and engineered T cells) that often cause, or are based on, immune reactions. In this review, we recapitulate some distinctive features of the immune system before reviewing microfluidic devices that mimic lymphoid organs or other organs and/or tissues with an integrated immune system component.",Human
"We demonstrate a method to double the collection efficiency in Laser Tweezers Raman Spectroscopy (LTRS) by collecting both the forward and back-scattered light in a single-shot multitrack measurement. Our method can collect signals at different sample volumes, granting both the pinpoint spatial selectivity of confocal Raman and the bulk sensitivity of non-confocal Raman simultaneously. Further, we display that our approach allows for reduced detector integration time and laser power. Thus, our method will enable the monitoring of biological samples sensitive to high intensities for longer times. Additionally, we demonstrate that by a simple modification, we can add polarization sensitivity and retrieve extra biochemical information.",Human
"The unprecedented prowess of measurement techniques provides a detailed, multi-scale look into the depths of living systems. Understanding these avalanches of high-dimensional data -- by distilling underlying principles and mechanisms -- necessitates dimensional reduction. We propose that living systems achieve exquisite dimensional reduction, originating from their capacity to learn, through evolution and phenotypic plasticity, the relevant aspects of a non-random, smooth physical reality. We explain how geometric insights by mathematicians allow one to identify these genuine hallmarks of life and distinguish them from universal properties of generic data sets. We illustrate these principles in a concrete example of protein evolution, suggesting a simple general recipe that can be applied to understand other biological systems.",Human
"The ability of bacteria to form biofilms hinders any conventional treatment against chronic infections and has serious socio-economic implications. In this sense, a nanocarrier capable of overcoming the barrier of the mucopolysaccharide matrix of the biofilm and releasing its loaded-antibiotic within would be desirable. Herein, a new nanosystem based on levofloxacin (LEVO)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) decorated with lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) has been developed. The presence of ConA promotes its internalization into the biofilm matrix, which increases the antimicrobial efficacy of the antibiotic hosted within the mesopores. This nanodevice is envisioned as a promising alternative to conventional infection treatments by improving the antimicrobial efficacy and reducing side effects.",Human
"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is currently of great interest in cell biology. LLPS is an example of what is called an emergent phenomenon -- an idea that comes from condensed-matter physics. Emergent phenomena have the characteristic feature of having a switch-like response. I show that the Hill equation of biochemistry can be used as a simple model of strongly cooperative, switch-like, behaviour. One result is that a switch-like response requires relatively few molecules, even ten gives a strongly switch-like response. Thus if a biological function enabled by LLPS relies on LLPS to provide a switch-like response to a stimulus, then condensates large enough to be visible in optical microscopy are not needed.",Human
"Diamond quantum thermometry exploits the optical and electrical spin properties of colour defect centres in diamonds and, acts as a quantum sensing method exhibiting ultrahigh precision and robustness. Compared to the existing luminescent nanothermometry techniques, a diamond quantum thermometer can be operated over a wide temperature range and a sensor spatial scale ranging from nanometres to micrometres. Further, diamond quantum thermometry is employed in several application, including electronics and biology, to explore these fields with nanoscale temperature measurements. This review covers the operational principles of diamond quantum thermometry for spin-based and all-optical methods, material development of diamonds with a focus on thermometry, and examples of applications in electrical and biological systems with demand-based technological requirements.",Human
"Lumen formation plays an essential role in the morphogenesis of tissues during development. Here we review the physical principles that play a role in the growth and coarsening of lumens. Solute pumping by the cell, hydraulic flows driven by differences of osmotic and hydrostatic pressures, balance of forces between extracellular fluids and cell-generated cytoskeletal forces, and electro-osmotic effects have been implicated in determining the dynamics and steady-state of lumens. We use the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics to discuss the relevant force, time and length scales involved in these processes. We focus on order of magnitude estimates of physical parameters controlling lumen formation and coarsening.",Human
"In this work Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is employed in thirty-day windows to quantify temporal evolution of relative pandemic mitigation inefficiency of Brazilian municipalities. For each thirty-day window the results of inefficiency scores of over five thousand Brazilian municipalities are displayed on maps, to address the spatial distribution of the corresponding values. This phenomenological spatiotemporal approach reveals location of the hotspots, in terms of relative pandemic inefficiency of the municipalities, at different points in time along the pandemic. It is expected that the current approach may subsidize decision making through comparative analysis of previous practice, and thus contribute to the future pandemic mitigation efforts.",Human
"Ion channels are important proteins for physiological information transfer and functional control. To predict the microscopic origins of their voltage-conductance characteristics, we here applied dissipation-corrected targeted Molecular Dynamics in combination with Langevin equation simulations to potassium diffusion through the Gramicidin A channel as a test system. Performing a non-equilibrium principal component analysis on backbone dihedral angles, we find coupled protein-ion dynamics to occur during ion transfer. The dissipation-corrected free energy profiles correspond well to predictions from other biased simulation methods. The incorporation of an external electric field in Langevin simulations enables the prediction of macroscopic observables in the form of I-V characteristics.",Human
"Mitochondrial diseases are largely caused by dysfunction in mitochondrial proteins. However, annotations of human mitochondrial proteins are scattered across various public databases and individual studies. To facilitate research aimed at elucidating mitochondrial functions, we constructed the MEGADOCK-Web-Mito database as a protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction data archive, including prediction results for exhaustive protein pairs of 654 mitochondria-related human proteins. MEGADOCK-Web-Mito enables users to search for all PPI prediction results efficiently and comprehensively. In particular, we linked functional annotations to each human mitochondrial protein. The comprehensive and specialized human mitochondrial PPI prediction results and searching function of MEGADOCK-Web-Mito will support further research on mitochondria and mitochondrial diseases.",Human
"In this paper, we estimate epidemiological data of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary using only the daily number of hospitalized patients, and applying well-known techniques from systems and control theory. We use a previously published and validated compartmental model for the description of epidemic spread. Exploiting the fact that an important subsystem of the model is linear, first we compute the number of latent infected persons in time. Then an estimate can be given for the number of people in other compartments. From these data, it is possible to track the time dependent reproduction numbers via a recursive least squares estimate. The credibility of the obtained results is discussed using available data from the literature.",Human
"When an epidemic spreads into a population, it is often unpractical or impossible to have a continuous monitoring of all subjects involved. As an alternative, algorithmic solutions can be used to infer the state of the whole population from a limited amount of measures. We analyze the capability of deep neural networks to solve this challenging task. Our proposed architecture is based on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. As such it can reason on the effect of the underlying social network structure, which is recognized as the main component in the spreading of an epidemic. We test the proposed architecture with two scenarios modeled on the CoVid-19 pandemic: a generic homogeneous population, and a toy model of Boston metropolitan area.",Human
"This article proposes a model including thermal effects for closed supercoiled DNA. Existing models include an elastic rod. Euler's elastica, ideal elastic rods on a plane, have only two kinds of closed shapes, the circle and a figure-eight, realized as minima of the Euler-Bernoulli energy. Even considering three dimensional effects, this elastica model provides much simpler shapes than observed via Atomic-Force Microscope (AFM), since the minimal points of the energy are expressed by elliptic functions. In this paper, by a generalization of elastica, we obtain shapes determined by data of hyperelliptic curves, which partially reproduce the shapes and properties of the DNA.",Human
"We construct an agent-based SEIR model to simulate COVID-19 spread at a 16000-student mostly non-residential urban university during the Fall 2021 Semester. We find that mRNA vaccine coverage above 80% makes it possible to safely reopen to in-person instruction. If vaccine coverage is 100%, then our model indicates that facemask use is not necessary. Our simulations with vaccine coverage below 70% exhibit a right-skew for total infections over the semester, which suggests that high levels of infection are not exceedingly rare with campus social connections the main transmission route. Less effective vaccines or incidence of new variants may require additional intervention such as screening testing to reopen safely.",Human
We report three-dimensional and time-dependent numerical simulations of the propagation of electrical action potentials in a model of rabbit ventricular tissue. The simulations are performed using a finite-element method for the solution of the monodomain equations of cardiac electrical excitation. The parameters of a detailed ionic ventricular cell model are re-fitted to available experimental data and the model is then used for the description of the transmembrane current and calcium dynamics. A region with reduced conductivity is introduced to model a myocardial infarction scar. Electrical activation times and density maps of the transmembrane voltage are computed and compared with experimental measurements in rabbit preparations with myocardial infarction obtained by a panoramic optical mapping method.,Human
"We propose a risk measure and construct an infectious diseases hazard map for India. Given an outbreak location, a hazard index is assigned to each city using an effective distance that depends on inter-city mobilities instead of geographical distance. We demonstrate its utility using an SIR model augmented with air, rail, and road data between top 446 cities. Simulations show that the effective distance from outbreak location reliably predicts the time of arrival of infection in other cities. The hazard index predictions compare well with the observed spread of SARS-CoV-2. The hazard map can be useful in other outbreaks also.",Human
"Antibodies are proteins in the immune system which bind to antigens to detect and neutralise them. The binding sites in an antibody-antigen interaction are known as the paratope and epitope, respectively, and the prediction of these regions is key to vaccine and synthetic antibody development. Contrary to prior art, we argue that paratope and epitope predictors require asymmetric treatment, and propose distinct neural message passing architectures that are geared towards the specific aspects of paratope and epitope prediction, respectively. We obtain significant improvements on both tasks, setting the new state-of-the-art and recovering favourable qualitative predictions on antigens of relevance to COVID-19.",Human
"Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms and can spread through different ways. Mathematical models and computational simulation have been used extensively to investigate the transmission and spread of infectious diseases. In other words, mathematical model simulation can be used to analyse the dynamics of infectious diseases, aiming to understand the effects and how to control the spread. In general, these models are based on compartments, where each compartment contains individuals with the same characteristics, such as susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered. In this paper, we cast further light on some classical epidemic models, reporting possible outcomes from numerical simulation. Furthermore, we provide routines in a repository for simulations.",Human
"Machine-learning models that learn from data to predict how protein sequence encodes function are emerging as a useful protein engineering tool. However, when using these models to suggest new protein designs, one must deal with the vast combinatorial complexity of protein sequences. Here, we review how to use a sequence-to-function machine-learning surrogate model to select sequences for experimental measurement. First, we discuss how to select sequences through a single round of machine-learning optimization. Then, we discuss sequential optimization, where the goal is to discover optimized sequences and improve the model across multiple rounds of training, optimization, and experimental measurement.",Human
"The search for more realistic models for interacting species has produced many adaptations of the original Lotka-Volterra equations, such as the inclusion of the Allee effect and the different Holling's types of functional response. In the present work we show that a correct implementation of both ideas together requires a careful formulation. We focus our work in the fact that a density dependent carrying capacity, combined with the Allee effect, can lead to meaningless effects. We illustrate the difficulties in predator-prey and two-species competition models, together with our proposed solution of the careful inclusion of the corresponding cubic terms.",Human
"We propose a novel approach for modelling bat motion dynamics and use it to predict roost locations using data from static acoustic detectors. Specifically, radio tracking studies of Greater Horseshoe bats demonstrate that bat movement can be split into two phases: dispersion and return. Dispersion is easily understood and can be modelled as simple random motion. The return phase is much more complex, as it requires intelligent directed motion and results in all agents returning home in a stereotypical manner. Critically, combining reaction-diffusion theory and domain shrinking we deterministically and stochastically model a ``leap-frogging'' motion, which fits favourably with the observed tracking data.",Human
"Much of interesting complex biological behaviour arises from collective properties. Important information about collective behaviour lies in the time and space structure of fluctuations around average properties, and two-point correlation functions are a fundamental tool to study these fluctuations. We give a self-contained presentation of definitions and techniques for computation of correlation functions aimed at providing students and researchers outside the field of statistical physics a practical guide to calculating correlation functions from experimental and simulation data. We discuss some properties of correlations in critical systems, and the effect of finite system size, which is particularly relevant for most biological experimental systems. Finally we apply these to the case of the dynamical transition in a simple neuronal model,",Human
"Synchrotron infrared hyperspectral microscopy is a label-free and non-invasive technique well suited for imaging of chemical events in situ. It can track the spatial and temporal distributions of molecules of interests in a specimen in its native state by the molecule's characteristic vibrational modes. Despite tremendous progress made in recent years, IR hyperspectral imaging of chemical events in biomaterials in liquids remains challenging because of the demanding requirements on environmental control and strong infrared absorption of water. Here we report a multi-phase capillary-driven membrane device for label-free and real-time investigation of enzymatic deconstruction of algal cellulose purified from Cladophora aegagropila.",Human
"The light environment controls the swimming of microalgae through a light-seeking and avoiding behaviour, which is known as phototaxis. In this work, we exploit phototaxis to control the migration and concentration of populations of the soil microalga {\it Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}. By imaging a suspension of these microalgae in a cuvette illuminated from above by blue light, we study how phototaxis changes the stability of the suspension and demonstrate how a thin, porous layer at the top of the cuvette prevents phototaxing microalgae from sinking, leading to the up-concentration of the microalgae in the region above the porous layer. We discuss the potential implications of our findings for microalgae in biotechnological applications and the natural environment.",Human
"Among the diverse and important applications that networks currently have is the modeling of infectious diseases. Immunization, or the process of protecting nodes in the network, plays a key role in stopping diseases from spreading. Hence the importance of having tools or strategies that allow the solving of this challenge. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of the DIL-W^{\alpha} ranking in immunizing nodes in an edge-weighted network. The network is obtained from a real database and the spread of COVID-19 was modeled with the classic SIR model. We apply the protection to the network, according to the importance ranking list produced by DIL-W^{\alpha}.",Human
"Motivated by recent epidemic outbreaks, including those of COVID-19, we solve the canonical problem of calculating the dynamics and likelihood of extensive outbreaks in a population within a large class of stochastic epidemic models with demographic noise, including the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and its general extensions. In the limit of large populations, we compute the probability distribution for all extensive outbreaks, including those that entail unusually large or small (extreme) proportions of the population infected. Our approach reveals that, unlike other well-known examples of rare events occurring in discrete-state stochastic systems, the statistics of extreme outbreaks emanate from a full continuum of Hamiltonian paths, each satisfying unique boundary conditions with a conserved probability flux.",Human
"With the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an increasing quest for more accessible, easy-to-use, rapid, inexpensive, and high accuracy diagnostic tools. Traditional disease diagnostic methods such as qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) require multiple steps, trained technicians, and long turnaround time that may worsen the disease surveillance and pandemic control. In sight of this situation, a rapid, one-step, easy-to-use, and high accuracy diagnostic platform will be valuable for future epidemic control especially for regions with scarce medical resources. Herein, we report a magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers: spike and nucleocapsid proteins.",Human
"We develop theoretical equivalences between stochastic and deterministic models for populations of individual cells stratified by age. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical system of equations describing the full dynamics of an age-structured multi-stage Markov process for approximating cell cycle time distributions. We further demonstrate that the resulting mean behaviour is equivalent, over large timescales, to the classical McKendrick-von Foerster integro-partial differential equation. We conclude by extending this framework to a spatial context, facilitating the modelling of travelling wave phenomena and cell-mediated pattern formation. More generally, this methodology may be extended to myriad reaction-diffusion processes for which the age of individuals is relevant to the dynamics.",Human
"Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have excellent magnetic-temperature characteristic. However, current temperature measurement based on MNPs is interfered by concentration. Utilizing the electron spin resonance (ESR), we propose a highly sensitive temperature measurement method without concentration coupling. The anisotropic field is affected by temperature, thus affecting the g-value. The influence of the MNP concentration, size, and the data analysis method on temperature estimation are studied. The optimal temperature sensitivity is achieved with 15-nm MNPs while Gaussian smoothing method allows an optimal accuracy at Fe concentration of 5 mg/ml with a root mean squared error of 0.07 K.",Human
"The inability of conventional methods to completely remove the contaminants from pharmaceutical effluents led us to study the effect of Electron Beam (EB) irradiation on real pharmaceutical wastewater. In this paper, the samples from different stages of existing treatment facilities of industry are irradiated with varying doses from 25 to 200 kGy. The study aimed to find a suitable combination of EB and conventional treatments for efficient degradation of complex pharmaceutical effluent. It has been successfully demonstrated that electron beam irradiation when combined with conventional techniques like coagulation before or after the irradiation improves the efficiency of the process, resulting in lower Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). In this investigation, the maximum COD reduction was found to be around 65 percent.",Human
"RNA 3D architectures are stabilized by sophisticated networks of (non-canonical) base pair interactions, which can be conveniently encoded as multi-relational graphs and efficiently exploited by graph theoretical approaches and recent progresses in machine learning techniques. RNAglib is a library that eases the use of this representation, by providing clean data, methods to load it in machine learning pipelines and graph-based deep learning models suited for this representation. RNAglib also offers other utilities to model RNA with 2.5D graphs, such as drawing tools, comparison functions or baseline performances on RNA applications.

"Scaffold based drug discovery (SBDD) is a technique for drug discovery which pins chemical scaffolds as the framework of design. Scaffolds, or molecular frameworks, organize the design of compounds into local neighborhoods. We formalize scaffold based drug discovery into a network design. Utilizing docking data from SARS-CoV-2 virtual screening studies and JAK2 kinase assay data, we showcase how a scaffold based conception of chemical space is intuitive for design. Lastly, we highlight the utility of scaffold based networks for chemical space as a potential solution to the intractable enumeration problem of chemical space by working inductively on local neighborhoods.",Human
"Previous studies of the flexibilities of ancestral proteins suggests that proteins evolve their function by altering their native state ensemble. Here we propose a more direct method of visualizing this by measuring the changes in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) of proteins as they evolve. Through analysis of VDOS profiles of ancestral and extant proteins we observe that $\beta$-lactamase and thioredoxins evolve by altering their density of states in the terahertz region. Particularly, the shift in VDOS profiles between ancestral and extant proteins suggests that nature utilize dynamic allostery for functional evolution. Moreover, we also show that VDOS profile of individual position can be used to describe the flexibility changes, particularly those without any amino acid substitution.",Human
"The information content of symbolic sequences (such as nucleic- or amino acid sequences, but also neuronal firings or strings of letters) can be calculated from an ensemble of such sequences, but because information cannot be assigned to single sequences, we cannot correlate information to other observables attached to the sequence. Here we show that an information score obtained from multivariate (multiple-variable) correlations within sequences of a ""training"" ensemble can be used to predict observables of out-of-sample sequences with an accuracy that scales with the complexity of correlations, showing that functional information emerges from a hierarchy of multi-variable correlations.",Human
"Compartmental epidemic models have been widely used for predicting the course of epidemics, from estimating the basic reproduction number to guiding intervention policies. Studies commonly acknowledge these models' assumptions but less often justify their validity in the specific context in which they are being used. Our purpose is not to argue for specific alternatives or modifications to compartmental models, but rather to show how assumptions can constrain model outcomes to a narrow portion of the wide landscape of potential epidemic behaviors. This concrete examination of well-known models also serves to illustrate general principles of modeling that can be applied in other contexts.",Human
"We analyze the susceptible-infected-susceptible model for epidemic spreading in which a fraction of the individuals become immune by vaccination. This process is understood as a dilution by vaccination, which decreases the fraction of the susceptible individuals. For a nonzero fraction of vaccinated individuals, the model predicts a new state in which the disease spreads but eventually becomes extinct. The new state emerges when the fraction of vaccinated individuals is greater than a critical value. The model predicts that this critical value increases as one increases the infection rate reaching an asymptotic value, which is strictly less than the unity. Above this asymptotic value, the extinction occurs no matter how large the infection rate is.",Human
"We propose the Fourier-domain transfer entropy spectrum, a novel generalization of transfer entropy, as a model-free metric of causality. For arbitrary systems, this approach systematically quantifies the causality among their different system components rather than merely analyze systems as entireties. The generated spectrum offers a rich-information representation of time-varying latent causal relations, efficiently dealing with non-stationary processes and high-dimensional conditions. We demonstrate its validity in the aspects of parameter dependence, statistic significance test, and sensibility. An open-source multi-platform implementation of this metric is developed and computationally applied on neuroscience data sets and diffusively coupled logistic oscillators.",Human
"We derive the Kuramoto model (KM) corresponding to a population of weakly coupled, nearly identical quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons with both electrical and chemical coupling. The ratio of chemical to electrical coupling determines the phase lag of the characteristic sine coupling function of the KM and critically determines the synchronization properties of the network. We apply our results to investigate chimera states in two coupled populations of identical QIF neurons. We find that the presence of both electrical and chemical coupling is a necessary condition for chimera states to exist. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that chimera states gradually disappear as coupling strengths cease to be weak.",Human
"We solve MacArthur's resource-competition model with random species-resource couplings in the `thermodynamic' limit of infinitely many species and resources using dynamical path-integrals a la De Domincis. We analyze how the steady state picture changes upon modifying several parameters, including the degree of heterogeneity of metabolic strategies (encoding the preferences of species) and of maximal resource levels (carrying capacities), and discuss its stability. Ultimately, the scenario obtained by other approaches is recovered by analyzing an effective one-species-one-resource ecosystem that is fully equivalent to the original multi-species one. The technique used here can be applied for the analysis of other model ecosystems related to the version of MacArthur's model considered here.",Human
"Cox analysis is a common clinical data analysis technique to link valuable variables to clinical outcomes including dead and relapse. In the omics era, Cox model batch processing is a basic strategy for screening clinically relevant variables, biomarker discovery and gene signature identification. However, all such analyses have been implemented with homebrew code in research community, thus lack of transparency and reproducibility. Here, we present ezcox, the first R/CRAN package for Cox model batch processing and visualization. ezcox is an open source R package under GPL-3 license and it is free available at https://github.com/ShixiangWang/ezcox and https://cran.r-project.org/package=ezcox.",Human
"Keeping a memory of evolving stimuli is ubiquitous in biology, an example of which is immune memory for evolving pathogens. However, learning and memory storage for dynamic patterns still pose challenges in machine learning. Here, we introduce an analytical energy-based framework to address this problem. By accounting for the tradeoff between utility in keeping a high-affinity memory and the risk in forgetting some of the diverse stimuli, we show that a moderate tolerance for risk enables a repertoire to robustly classify evolving patterns, without much fine-tuning. Our approach offers a general guideline for learning and memory storage in systems interacting with diverse and evolving stimuli.",Human
"We experimentally investigate the effects of polymer additives on the collective dynamics of swarming Serratia marcescens in quasi two-dimensional (2D) liquid films. We find that even minute amounts of polymers (< 20 ppm) can significantly enhance swimming speed and promote largescale coherent structures. Velocity statistics show that polymers suppress large velocity fluctuation, transforming the velocity distributions from super-Gaussian to Gaussian. Spatial and temporal correlation functions suggest that polymers increase both the size and lifetime of flow structures. The energy spectra show an exponential decay at low wavenumbers, with a characteristic length scale increasing with polymer concentration. Overall, these result show polymers can mediate bacteria interaction and promote large-scale coherence in dense active suspensions.",Human
"The ""Phase Response Curve"" (PRC) is a common tool used to analyze phase resetting in the natural sciences. We make the observation that the PRC with respect to a coordinate $y\in\mathbb{R}$ actually depends on the full choice of coordinates $(x,y)$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$. We give a coordinate-free definition of the PRC making this observation obvious. We show how by controlling $y$, using delay coordinates of $y$, and postulating the dynamics of $x$ as a function of $x$ and $y$, we can sometimes reconstruct the PRC with respect to the $(x,y)$ coordinates. This suggests a means for obtaining the PRC of, e.g., a neuron via a voltage clamp.",Human
"The long timescale associated with ligand residence times renders their computation challenging. Therefore, the influence of factors like solvation and steric hindrance on residence times are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate in a set of model host-guest systems that the recently developed Gaussian Mixture Based Enhanced Sampling allows residence times to be computed and enables understanding their unbinding mechanism. We observe that guest unbinding often proceeds via a series of intermediate states that can be labelled by the number of water molecules present in the binding cavity. And in several cases the residence time is correlated to the water trapping times in the cavity.",Human
"Hypertension is the leading global cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death. Distinct hypertension subtypes may vary in their prognoses and require different treatments. An individual's risk for hypertension is determined by genetic and environmental factors as well as their interactions. In this work, we studied 911 African Americans and 1,171 European Americans in the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) cohort. We built hypertension subtype classification models using both environmental variables and sets of genetic features selected based on different criteria. The fitted prediction models provided insights into the genetic landscape of hypertension subtypes, which may aid personalized diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in the future.",Human
"Along with recent progress in structural biology and genome biology, structural dynamics of molecular systems including nucleic acids has attracted attention in the context of gene regulation. Structure-function relationship is an important topic, where physicochemical properties of nucleotides are important as well as those of amino acids in proteins. Simulation is a useful tool for the analysis of molecular dynamics in detail, complementary to experiments. However, molecular simulation of nucleic acids has less developed than that of proteins yet, partly due to the physical nature of nucleic acids. In this review, we briefly describe the current situation and future directions of the field, hopefully as a guide to collaboration between experiment and computation.",Human
"In this work, we consider the motion of a polaron in a polynucleotide Holstein molecular chain in a constant electric field. It is shown that the character of the polaron motion in the chain depends not only on the chosen parameters of the chain, but also on the initial distribution of the charge along the chain. It is shown that for a small set value of the electric field intensity and for fixed values of the chain parameters, changing only the initial distribution of the charge in the chain, it is possible to observe either a uniform movement of the charge along the chain, or an oscillatory mode of charge movement.",Human
"In this paper, we utilized generative models, and reformulate it for problems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, by introducing an MD potential energy component to our generative model. By incorporating potential energy as calculated from TorchMD into a conditional generative framework, we attempt to construct a low-potential energy route of transformation between the helix~$\rightarrow$~coil structures of a protein. We show how to add an additional loss function to conditional generative models, motivated by potential energy of molecular configurations, and also present an optimization technique for such an augmented loss function. Our results show the benefit of this additional loss term on synthesizing realistic molecular trajectories.",Human
"Rare variants are hypothesized to be largely responsible for heritability and susceptibility to disease in humans. So rare variants association studies hold promise for understanding disease. Conversely though, the rareness of the variants poses practical challenges; since these variants are present in few individuals, it can be difficult to develop data-collection and statistical methods that effectively leverage their sparse information. In this work, we develop a novel Bayesian nonparametric model to capture how design choices in rare variants association studies can impact their usefulness. We then show how to use our model to guide design choices under a fixed experimental budget in practice. In particular, we provide a practical workflow and illustrative experiments on simulated data.",Human
"We present a wireless QCM biosensor fabricated using MEMS technology. The MEMS QCM biosensor contains a 125-MHz AT-cut quartz resonator embedded in the microchannel. Because of the compact design, the MEMS QCM biosensor is suitable for mass production and device miniaturization. We performed the IgG detection measurement with different concentrations. The detection limit was l ng/mL or less, which is superior to that of the gold-standard SPR method. Furthermore, we studied the binding affinity between protein A and IgG by studying the frequency response of the QCM biosensor. It shows good agreement with reported values. Therefore, the presented MEMS QCM biosensor has advantages of compact, low cost, low power consumption, high sensitivity, and reliability.",Human
"We formulate a theory of electrostatic interactions in lipid bilayer membranes where both monolayer leaflets contain dissociable moieties that are subject to charge regulation. We specifically investigate the coupling between membrane curvature and charge regulation of a lipid bilayer vesicle using both the linear Debye-H\""uckel (DH) and the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory. We find that charge regulation of an otherwise symmetric bilayer membrane can induce charge symmetry breaking, non-linear flexoelectricity and anomalous curvature dependence of free energy. The pH effects investigated go beyond the paradigm of electrostatic renormalization of the mechano-elastic properties of membranes.",Human
"We develop a model for simulating the heat transfer phenomena within a biological soft material using the Ikeda chaotic map. Our approach is implemented by sampling the optical intensity via the Ikeda map to investigate the influence on the heat distribution over the tissue. Our method has many potential advantages including the possibility of investigating the nonlinear optical effects resulting from the intense beam-induced feedback mechanisms. This in turn, leads to the flexibility and dynamical controllability in comparison to the quasi-static Monte-Carlo method. The proposed approach is thus appropriate for the applications in the light beam-guided nanodrug injection and microsurgery.",Human
"Standard dosimetry protocols exist for highly penetrating photon and particle beams used in the clinic and in research. However, these protocols cannot be directly applied to shallow penetration MeV-range ion beams. The Radiological Research Accelerator Facility has been using such beams for almost 50 years to irradiate cell monolayers, using self-developed dosimetry, based on tissue equivalent ionization chambers.   To better align with the internationally accepted standards, we describe implementation of a commercial, NIST-traceable, air-filled ionization chamber for measurement of absorbed dose to water from low energy ions, using radiation quality correction factors calculated using TRS-398 recommendations. The reported dose does not depend on the ionization density in the range of 10-150 keV/micron.",Human
"With the increasing availability and size of multi-omics datasets, investigating the casual relationships between molecular phenotypes has become an important aspect of exploring underlying biology and genetics. This paper aims to introduce and review the available methods for building large-scale causal molecular networks that have been developed in the past decade. Existing methods have their own strengths and limitations so there is no one best approach, and it is instead down to the discretion of the researcher. This review also aims to discuss some of the current limitations to biological interpretation of these networks, and important factors to consider for future studies on molecular networks.",Human
"Understanding the evolutionary stability of cooperation is a central problem in biology, sociology, and economics. There exist only a few known mechanisms that guarantee the existence of cooperation and its robustness to cheating. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for the emergence of cooperation in the presence of fluctuations. We consider agents whose wealth change stochastically in a multiplicative fashion. Each agent can share part of her wealth as public good, which is equally distributed among all the agents. We show that, when agents operate with long time-horizons, cooperation produce an advantage at the individual level, as it effectively screens agents from the deleterious effect of environmental fluctuations.",Human
"A deterministic pathogen transmission model based on high-fidelity physics has been developed. The model combines computational fluid dynamics and computational crowd dynamics in order to be able to provide accurate tracing of viral matter that is exhaled, transmitted and inhaled via aerosols. The examples shown indicate that even with modest computing resources, the propagation and transmission of viral matter can be simulated for relatively large areas with thousands of square meters, hundreds of pedestrians and several minutes of physical time. The results obtained and insights gained from these simulations can be used to inform global pandemic propagation models, increasing substantially their accuracy.",Human
"Understanding the structure of supramolecular complexes provides insight into their functional capabilities and how they can be modulated in the context of disease. Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) excels in performing this task by resolving ultrastructural details at the nanoscale with molecular specificity. However, technical limitations, such as underlabelling, preclude its ability to provide complete structures. Single-particle analysis (SPA) overcomes this limitation by combining information from multiple images of identical structures and producing an averaged model, effectively enhancing the resolution and coverage of image reconstructions. This review highlights important studies using SRM-SPA, demonstrating how it broadens our knowledge by elucidating features of key biological structures with unprecedented detail.",Human
"Intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging of the retina, also termed as optoretinography (ORG), promises a noninvasive method for objective assessment of retinal function. By providing unparalleled capability to differentiate individual layers of the retina, functional optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been actively investigated for intrinsic signal ORG measurements. However, clinical deployment of functional OCT for quantitative ORG is still challenging due to the lack of a standardized imaging protocol and the complication of IOS sources and mechanisms. This article aims to summarize recent developments of functional OCT for ORG measurement, OCT intensity- and phase-based IOS processing. Technical challenges and perspectives of quantitative IOS analysis and ORG interpretations are discussed.",Human
"The mechanical properties of a kiwifruit are investigated via non-contact acoustic measurements. Transmitted ultrasonic waves are measured using a static laser source and a rotating laser ultrasound detector. The measurements enable observation of a low-frequency surface wave and a higher frequency direct wave; combined with seismology-inspired theoretical modeling, these measurements enable estimation of several elastic parameters for inner and outer fruit flesh layers. Results indicate that the surface and direct wave velocities and the bulk and Young's moduli all evolve with fruit age/ripeness, while only the direct wave velocity and bulk modulus differ significantly between outer and inner fruit layers.",Human
"Neuromorphic computing exploits the dynamical analogy between many physical systems and neuron biophysics. Superconductor systems, in particular, are excellent candidates for neuromorphic devices due to their capacity to operate in great speeds and with low energy dissipation compared to their silicon counterparts. In this study we revisit a prior work on Josephson Junction-based ""neurons"" in order to identify the exact dynamical mechanisms underlying the system's neuron-like properties and reveal new complex behaviors which are relevant for neurocomputation and the design of superconducting neuromorphic devices. Our work lies at the intersection of superconducting physics and theoretical neuroscience, both viewed under a common framework, that of nonlinear dynamics theory.",Human

Along this line of thinking, projects such as Retinal Prosthetic Strategy with the Capacity to Restore Normal Vision from Weill Medical College of Cornell University Project, Update on Retinal Prosthetic Research from The Boston Retinal Implant Project, and Restoration of Vision Using Wireless Cortical Implants from Monash Vision Group Project, have shown in a different context the use of technologies that commits to bring the vision through its use.",Human
"Stars with masses $\gtrsim 4 \times 10^{27}M_{\rm{moose}} \approx 1.1 M_\odot$ have core convection zones during their time on the main sequence. In these moosive stars, convection introduces many uncertainties in stellar modeling. In this Letter, we build upon the Boussinesq approximation to present the first-ever simulations of Moosinesq convection, which captures the complex geometric structure of the convection zones of these stars. These flows are bounded in a manner informed by the majestic terrestrial Alces alces (moose) and could have important consequences for the evolution of these stars. We find that Moosinesq convection results in very interesting flow morphologies and rapid heat transfer, and posit this as a mechanism of biomechanical thermoregulation.",Human
"We investigate the problem of using a learning-based strategy to stabilize a synthetic toggle switch via an external control approach. To overcome the data efficiency problem that would render the algorithm unfeasible for practical use in synthetic biology, we adopt a sim-to-real paradigm where the policy is learnt via training on a simplified model of the toggle switch and it is then subsequently exploited to control a more realistic model of the switch parameterized from in-vivo experiments. Our in-silico experiments confirm the viability of the approach suggesting its potential use for in-vivo control implementations.",Human
"AlphaFold2 (AF) is a promising tool, but is it accurate enough to predict single mutation effects? Here, we report that the localized structural deformation between protein pairs differing by only 1-3 mutations -- as measured by the effective strain -- is correlated across \num{3901} experimental and AF-predicted structures. Furthermore, analysis of ${\sim} 11000$ proteins shows that the local structural change correlates with various phenotypic changes. These findings suggest that AF can predict the range and magnitude of single-mutation effects on average, and we propose a method to improve precision of AF predictions and to indicate when predictions are unreliable.",Human
"Identifying and characterizing mutational paths is an important issue in evolutionary biology and in bioengineering. We here introduce a generic description of mutational paths in terms of the goodness of sequences and of the mutational dynamics (how sequences change) along the path. We first propose an algorithm to sample mutational paths, which we benchmark on exactly solvable models of proteins in silico, and apply to data-driven models of natural proteins learned from sequence data with Restricted Boltzmann Machines. We then use mean-field theory to characterize the properties of mutational paths for different mutational dynamics of interest, and show how it can be used to extend Kimura's estimate of evolutionary distances to sequence-based epistatic models of selection.",Human
"Depletion of natural and artificial resources is a fundamental problem and a potential cause of economic crises, ecological catastrophes, and death of living organisms. Understanding the depletion process is crucial for its further control and optimized replenishment of resources. In this paper, we investigate a stock depletion by a population of species that undergo an ordinary diffusion and consume resources upon each encounter with the stock. We derive the exact form of the probability density of the random depletion time, at which the stock is exhausted. The dependence of this distribution on the number of species, the initial amount of resources, and the geometric setting is analyzed. Future perspectives and related open problems are discussed.",Human
"Neural oscillations are electrical activities of the brain measurable at different frequencies. This paper studies the interaction between the fast and slow processes in the brain. We recorded signals intracranially from the simple Wistar rats, performed the signal processing, and computed the correlation between envelopes of the high-frequency gamma rhythm and a low-frequency ECoG signal. The analysis shows that the low-frequency signal (delta rhythm) modulates the gamma rhythm with a small time delay. Further, we used simple excitable neuron models, namely FitzHugh-Nagumo and Hindmarsh-Rose, to simulate the gamma rhythm. The low-frequency signal delta rhythm can be used as the input to affect the threshold and simulate gamma rhythm using these neuron models.",Human
"In multicellular systems, the single-cell behaviors should be coordinated consistently with the overall population dynamics and functions. However, the interrelation between single-cell rules and the population-level goal is still elusive. In this work, we reveal that these two levels are naturally connected via a gradient flow structure of the heterogeneous cellular population and that biologically prevalent single-cell rules such as unidirectional type-switching and hierarchical order in types emerge from this structure. We also demonstrate the gradient flow structure in a standard model of the T-cell immune response. This theoretical framework works as a basis for understanding multicellular dynamics and functions.",Human
"Biological systems are very robust to morphological damage, but artificial systems (robots) are currently not. In this paper we present a system based on neural cellular automata, in which locomoting robots are evolved and then given the ability to regenerate their morphology from damage through gradient-based training. Our approach thus combines the benefits of evolution to discover a wide range of different robot morphologies, with the efficiency of supervised training for robustness through differentiable update rules. The resulting neural cellular automata are able to grow virtual robots capable of regaining more than 80\% of their functionality, even after severe types of morphological damage.",Human
"The brain is composed of complex networks of interacting neurons that express considerable heterogeneity in their physiology and spiking characteristics. How does neural heterogeneity affect macroscopic neural dynamics and how does it contribute to neurodynamic functions? In this letter, we address these questions by studying the macroscopic dynamics of networks of heterogeneous Izhikevich neurons. We derive mean-field equations for these networks and examine how heterogeneity in the spiking thresholds of Izhikevich neurons affects the emergent macroscopic dynamics. Our results suggest that the level of heterogeneity of inhibitory populations controls resonance and hysteresis properties of systems of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Neural heterogeneity may thus serve as a means to control the dynamic repertoire of mesoscopic brain circuits.",Human
"The Turing completeness of continuous chemical reaction networks (CRNs) states that any computable real function can be computed by a continuous CRN on a finite set of molecular species, possibly restricted to elementary reactions, i.e. with at most two reactants and mass action law kinetics. In this paper, we introduce a notion of online analog computation for the CRNs that stabilize the concentration of their output species to the result of some function of the concentration values of their input species, whatever changes are operated on the inputs during the computation. We prove that the set of real functions stabilized by a CRN with mass action law kinetics is precisely the set of real algebraic functions.",Human
"We study synchronization in bulk suspensions of spherical microswimmers with chiral trajectories using large scale numerics. The model is generic. It corresponds to the lowest order solution of a general model for self-propulsion at low Reynolds numbers, consisting of a nonaxisymmetric rotating source dipole. We show that both purely circular and helical swimmers can spontaneously synchronize their rotation. The synchronized state corresponds to velocity alignment with high orientational order in both the polar and azimuthal directions. Finally, we consider a racemic mixture of helical swimmers where intraspecies synchronization is observed while the system remains as a spatially uniform fluid. Our results demonstrate hydrodynamic synchronization as a natural collective phenomenon for microswimmers with chiral trajectories.",Human
"In a previous work, we presented a model that integrates cancer cell differentiation and immunotherapy, analysing a particular therapy against cancer stem cells by cytotoxic cell vaccines. As every biological system is exposed to random fluctuations, it is important to study its stochasticity. The influence of demographic and multiplicative noise in the system is carry out on the parameters of reproduction and death in cancer cells. On the other hand, we incorporated fluctuations by adding multiplicative noise. In both cases, we analysed the dynamics for different values of the parameters involved. The final amount of cancer cells decreases for different combinations of these parameters and noise intensity is found.",Human
"The transport of particles in cells is influenced by the properties of intracellular networks they traverse while searching for localized target regions or reaction partners. Moreover, given the rapid turnover in many intracellular structures, it is crucial to understand how temporal changes in the network structure affect diffusive transport. In this work, we use network theory to characterize complex intracellular biological environments across scales. We develop an efficient computational method to compute the mean first passage times for simulating a particle diffusing along two-dimensional planar networks extracted from fluorescence microscopy imaging. We first benchmark this methodology in the context of synthetic networks, and subsequently apply it to live-cell data from endoplasmic reticulum tubular networks.",Human
"Could nature be harnessing quantum mechanics in cilia to optimize the sensitivity of the mechanism of left-right symmetry breaking during development in vertebrates? I evaluate whether mechanosensing -- i.e., the detection of a left-right asymmetric signal through mechanical stimulation of sensory cilia, as opposed to biochemical signalling -- might be functioning in the embryonic left-right organizer of the vertebrate bodyplan through quantum mechanics. I conclude that there is a possible role for quantum biology in mechanosensing in cilia. The system may not be limited by classical thermal noise, but instead by quantum noise, with an amplification process providing active cooling.",Human
"Selectivity of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) is compared with that of its receptor proteins (R) with fluctuations of odor binding-releasing process taken into account. The binding-releasing process is modeled as N Bernoulli trials, where N is the total number of R per ORN. Dimensionless selectivities for both R and ORN are introduced and compared with each other. It is found the ORN's selectivity can be much higher then that of its receptor proteins. This effect is concentration-dependent. Possible application for biosensors is discussed.

"Based on a Hamiltonian that incorporates the elastic coupling between a tracer and active particles, we derive a generalized Langevin model for the non-equilibrium mechanical response of active viscoelastic biomatter. Our model accounts for the power-law viscoelastic response of the embedding polymeric network as well as for the non-equilibrium energy transfer between active and tracer particles. Our analytical expressions for the frequency-dependent response function and the positional autocorrelation function agree nicely with experimental data for red blood cells and actomyosin networks with and without ATP. The fitted effective active-particle temperature, elastic constants and effective friction coefficients of our model allow straightforward physical interpretation.",Human
"We interpret the Moran model of natural selection and drift as an algorithm for learning features of a simplified fitness landscape, specifically genotype superiority. This algorithm's efficiency in extracting these characteristics is evaluated by comparing it to a novel Bayesian learning algorithm developed using information-theoretic tools. This algorithm makes use of a communication channel analogy between an environment and an evolving population. We use the associated channel-rate to determine an informative population-sampling procedure. We find that the algorithm can identify genotype superiority faster than the Moran model but at the cost of larger fluctuations in uncertainty.",Human
"We study the effect of randomly distributed diffusivities and speeds in two models for active particle dynamics with active and passive fluctuations. We demonstrate how non-Gaussian displacement distributions emerge in these models in the long time limit, including Cauchy-type and exponential (Laplace) shapes. Notably the resulting shapes of the displacement distributions with distributed diffusivities for the active models considered here are in striking contrast to passive diffusion models. For the active motion models our discussion points out the differences between active- and passive-noise. Specifically, we demonstrate that the case with active-noise is in nice agreement with measured data for the displacement distribution of social amoeba.",Human
"We review the literature on swimming in complex fluids. A classification is proposed by comparing the length and time scales of a swimmer with those of nearby obstacles, interpreted broadly, extending from rigid or soft confining boundaries to molecules which confer the bulk fluid with complex stresses. A third dimension in the classification is the concentration of swimmers, which incorporates fluids whose complexity arises purely by the collective motion of swimming organisms. For each of the eight system classes which we identify we provide a background and describe modern research findings. While some classes have seen a great deal of attention for decades, others remain uncharted waters still open and awaiting exploration.",Human
"Oscillations of gas bubbles in liquids irradiated with acoustic pressure waves may result in an intriguing physical phenomenon called sonoluminescence, where a collapsing bubble emits the light in a broad optical spectral range. However, the intensity of the so-generated light is typically weak for practical purposes. Recently, it has been demonstrated that nanoparticles can be used to increase the efficiency of sonoluminescence, thereby enabling one to generate the light that is intense enough for a number of applications in photonics, biomedicine and material science. In this article, we review the latest achievements in the field of nanoparticle-enhanced sonoluminescence and showcase the perspectives of their practical applications.",Human
"Preferential selection of a given enantiomer over its chiral counterpart becomes increasingly relevant in the advent of the next era of medical drug design. In parallel, cavity quantum electrodynamics has grown into a solid framework to control energy transfer and chemical reactivity. In this work, we derive an analytical solution to a system of many chiral emitters interacting with a chiral cavity -- in analogy to the widely used Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield models of quantum optics. We are able to estimate the discriminating strength of chiral polaritonics, discuss possible future development directions, exciting applications such as elucidating homochirality, and deliver much needed intuition to foster the freshly flourishing field of chiral polaritonics.",Human
"Non-reciprocal interactions fueled by local energy consumption can be found in biological and synthetic active matter at scales where viscoelastic forces are important. Such systems can be described by ""odd"" viscoelasticity, which assumes fewer material symmetries than traditional theories. Here we study odd viscoelasticity analytically and using lattice Boltzmann simulations. We identify a pattern-forming instability which produces an oscillating array of fluid vortices, and we elucidate which features govern the growth rate, wavelength, and saturation of the vortices. Our observation of pattern formation through odd mechanical response can inform models of biological patterning and guide engineering of odd dynamics in soft active matter systems.",Human
"Nanostructured surfaces enhance ion yields in matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The spike protein complex, S1, is one fingerprint signature of Sars-CoV-2 with a mass of 75 kDa. Here, we show that MALDI-MS yields of Sars-CoV-2 spike protein ions in the 100 kDa range are enhanced 50-fold when the matrix-analyte solution is placed on substrates that are coated with a dense forest of multi-walled carbon nanotubes, compared to yields from uncoated substrates. Nanostructured substrates can support the development of mass spectrometry techniques for sensitive pathogen detection and environmental monitoring.",Human
"Realistic modeling of brain involves large number of neurons. The important question is how this size affects transmission efficiency? Here, these issue is studied in terms of Shannon's Theory. Mutual Information between input and output signals for simple class of networks with an increasing number of neurons is analyzed theoretically and numerically. Levy-Baxter neural model is applied. It turned out, that for these networks the Mutual Information converges, with increasing size, asymptotically very slowly to saturation level. This suggests that from certain level, the increase of neurons number does not imply significant increase in transmission efficiency, contributes rather to reliability.",Human
"We develop a Fokker-Planck theory of tissue growth with three types of cells (symmetrically dividing, asymmetrically dividing and non-dividing) as main agents to study the growth dynamics of human cerebral organoids. Fitting the theory to lineage tracing data obtained in next generation sequencing experiments, we show that the growth of cerebral organoids is a critical process. We derive analytical expressions describing the time evolution of clonal lineage sizes and show how power-law distributions arise in the limit of long times due to the vanishing of a characteristic growth scale. We discuss that the independence of critical growth on initial conditions could be biologically advantageous.",Human
"Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as the most devastating neurodegenerative disease worldwide, has reached nearly 10 million new cases annually. Current technology provides unprecedented opportunities to study the progression and etiology of this disease with the advanced in imaging techniques. With the recent emergence of a society driven by big data and machine learning (ML), researchers have exerted considerable effort to summarize recent advances in ML-based AD diagnosis. Here, we outline some of the most prevalent and recent ML models for assessing the progression of AD and provide insights on the challenges, opportunities, and future directions that could be advantageous to future research in AD using ML.",Human
"Proteins play a central role in biology from immune recognition to brain activity. While major advances in machine learning have improved our ability to predict protein structure from sequence, determining protein function from structure remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce Holographic Convolutional Neural Network (H-CNN) for proteins, which is a physically motivated machine learning approach to model amino acid preferences in protein structures. H-CNN reflects physical interactions in a protein structure and recapitulates the functional information stored in evolutionary data. H-CNN accurately predicts the impact of mutations on protein function, including stability and binding of protein complexes. Our interpretable computational model for protein structure-function maps could guide design of novel proteins with desired function.",Human
"In this work we study the dynamics in an apocalypse where the individuals can temporarily become zombies, returning to the living state again or die. We describe this dynamics using a modified version of the epidemic SIS model. The zombies can die when in contact with a terminator, which is part of the living people. To define the possible interactions we use an Erd\""{o}s-R\`{e}nyi network and we calculate how the absorbing and active phase of the original SIS model is influenced by the average network degree. We also use the component and domain distribution of the network to understand how this influence occurs.",Human
"Hippocampal place cells can encode spatial locations of an animal in physical or task-relevant spaces. We simulated place cell populations that encoded either Euclidean- or graph-based positions of a rat navigating to goal nodes in a maze with a graph topology, and used manifold learning methods such as UMAP and Autoencoders (AE) to analyze these neural population activities. The structure of the latent spaces learned by the AE reflects their true geometric structure, while PCA fails to do so and UMAP is less robust to noise. Our results support future applications of AE architectures to decipher the geometry of spatial encoding in the brain.",Human
"Switch-like motifs are among the basic building blocks of biochemical networks. A common motif that can serve as an ultrasensitive switch consists of two enzymes acting antagonistically on a substrate, one making and the other removing a covalent modification. To work as a switch, such covalent modification cycles must be held out of thermodynamic equilibrium by continuous expenditure of energy. Here, we exploit the linear framework for timescale separation to establish tight bounds on the performance of any covalent-modification switch, in terms of the chemical potential difference driving the cycle. The bounds apply to arbitrary enzyme mechanisms, not just Michaelis-Menten, with arbitrary rate constants, and thereby reflect fundamental physical constraints on covalent switching.",Human
"Resolving the structural variability of proteins is often key to understanding the structure-function relationship of those macromolecular machines. Single particle analysis using Cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM), combined with machine learning algorithms, provides a way to reveal the dynamics within the protein system from noisy micrographs. Here, we introduce an improved computational method that uses Gaussian mixture models for protein structure representation and deep neural networks for conformation space embedding. By integrating information from molecular models into the heterogeneity analysis, we can resolve complex protein conformational changes at near atomic resolution and present the results in a more interpretable form.",Human
"Macromolecules change their shape (conformation) in the process of carrying out their functions. The imaging by cryo-electron microscopy of rapidly-frozen, individual copies of macromolecules (single particles) is a powerful and general approach to understanding the motions and energy landscapes of macromolecules. Widely-used computational methods already allow the recovery of a few distinct conformations from heterogeneous single-particle samples, but the treatment of complex forms of heterogeneity such as the continuum of possible transitory states and flexible regions remains largely an open problem. In recent years there has been a surge of new approaches for treating the more general problem of continuous heterogeneity. This paper surveys the current state of the art in this area.",Human
"All-cause mortality is a very coarse grain, albeit very reliable, index to check the health implications of lifestyle determinants, systemic threats and socio-demographic factors. In this work we adopt a statistical-mechanics approach to the analysis of temporal fluctuations of all-cause mortality, focusing on the correlation structure of this index across different regions of Italy. The correlation network among the 20 Italian regions was reconstructed using temperature oscillations and travellers' flux (as a function of distance and region's attractiveness, based on GDP), allowing for a separation between infective and non-infective death causes. The proposed approach allows monitoring of emerging systemic threats in terms of anomalies of correlation network structure.",Human
"We present a method to capture the 7-dimensional light field structure, and translate it into perceptually-relevant information. Our spectral cubic illumination method quantifies objective correlates of perceptually relevant diffuse and directed light components, including their variations over time, space, in color and direction, and the environment's response to sky and sunlight. We applied it 'in the wild', capturing how light on a sunny day differs between light and shadow, and how light varies over sunny and cloudy days. We discuss the added value of our method for capturing nuanced lighting effects on scene and object appearance, such as chromatic gradients.",Human
"By demonstrating the role that historical population replacements and waves of admixture have played around the world, the genetics work of Reich and colleagues has provided a paradigm for understanding human history [Reich et al. 2009; Reich et al. 2012; Patterson et al. 2012]. Although we show in Ioannidis et al. [2021] that the peopling of Polynesia was a range expansion, and not, as suggested by Huang et al. [2022], yet another example of waves of admixture and large-scale gene flow between populations, we believe that our result in this recently settled oceanic expanse is the exception that proves the rule.",Human
"We present an exploratory population dynamics approach, described by Lotka-Volterra (LV) generalized equations, to explain/predict the dynamics and competition between land use/land cover (LULC) classes over vulnerable regions in Uruguay. We use the Mapbiomas-Pampa dataset composed by 20 annual LULC maps from 2000-2019. From these LULC maps we extract the main LULC classes, their spatial distribution and the time series of areas covered for each class. The interaction coefficients between species are inferred through the pairwise maximum entropy (PME) method from the spatial covariance matrices for different training periods. The main finding is that this LVPME method globally outperforms the more traditional Markov chains approach at predicting the trajectories of areas of LULC classes.",Human
"Machine learning methods have seen increased application to geospatial environmental problems, such as precipitation nowcasting, haze forecasting, and crop yield prediction. However, many of the machine learning methods applied to mosquito population and disease forecasting do not inherently take into account the underlying spatial structure of the given data. In our work, we apply a spatially aware graph neural network model consisting of GraphSAGE layers to forecast the presence of West Nile virus in Illinois, to aid mosquito surveillance and abatement efforts within the state. More generally, we show that graph neural networks applied to irregularly sampled geospatial data can exceed the performance of a range of baseline methods including logistic regression, XGBoost, and fully-connected neural networks.",Human
"After application of a step stimulus, in the form of a sudden change in attractant environment, the receptor activity and tumbling bias of an {\sl E. coli} cell change sharply to reach their extremal values before they gradually relax to their post-stimulus adapted levels in the long time limit. We perform numerical simulations and exact calculations to investigate the short time response of the cell. For both activity and tumbling bias, we exactly derive the condition for extremal response and find good agreement with simulations. We also make experimentally verifiable prediction that there is an optimum size of the step stimulus at which the extremal response is reached in the shortest possible time.",Human
"Probing the transport of fluids within confined domains is important in many areas including material science, catalysis, food science, and cell biology. The diffusion propagator fully characterizes the diffusion process, which is highly sensitive to the confining boundaries as well as the structure within enclosed pores. While magnetic resonance has been used extensively to observe various features of the diffusion process, its full characterization has been elusive. Here, we address this challenge by employing a special sequence of magnetic field gradient pulses for measuring the diffusion propagator, which allows for `listening to the drum' and determining not only the pore's shape but also diffusive dynamics within it.",Human
"The industrial application of non-thermal plasma has been a research field in the last few years. One of the potential applications of non-thermal plasma is in treating dye effluents of textiles industries which are considered as one of the environmental pollutants. Before scaling up plasma technology at the industrial level, it is required to understand the interaction of non-thermal plasma with a synthetic dye-containing solution in laboratory experiments. A detailed comparative study of MB dye degradation using an atmospheric pressure air plasma (corona discharge) source is carried out in this report. The results are qualitatively discussed in line with the available theoretical and experimental background of plasma-water interaction.",Human
"Collectives of actively-moving particles can spontaneously separate into dilute and dense phases -- a fascinating phenomenon known as motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). MIPS is well-studied for randomly-moving particles with no directional bias. However, many forms of active matter exhibit collective chemotaxis, directed motion along a chemical gradient that the constituent particles can generate themselves. Here, using theory and simulations, we demonstrate that collective chemotaxis strongly competes with MIPS -- in some cases, arresting or completely suppressing phase separation, or in other cases, generating fundamentally new dynamic instabilities. We establish quantitative principles describing this competition, thereby helping to reveal and clarify the rich physics underlying active matter systems that perform chemotaxis, ranging from cells to robots.",Human
"The olfactory search POMDP (partially observable Markov decision process) is a sequential decision-making problem designed to mimic the task faced by insects searching for a source of odor in turbulence, and its solutions have applications to sniffer robots. As exact solutions are out of reach, the challenge consists in finding the best possible approximate solutions while keeping the computational cost reasonable. We provide a quantitative benchmarking of a solver based on deep reinforcement learning against traditional POMDP approximate solvers. We show that deep reinforcement learning is a competitive alternative to standard methods, in particular to generate lightweight policies suitable for robots.",Human
"Black-box optimization methods play an important role in many fields of computational simulation. In particular, such methods are often used in the design and modelling of biological systems, including proteins and their complexes with various ligands. This work is mainly focused on the protein-protein docking that plays a key role in modern drug-design workflows. We develop a black-box approach for such docking problems using a novel technique based on the tensor-train decomposition of high-dimensional interaction functions. Our method shows an advantage in terms of the discovered global minima and has a high potential for further implementation on a wide range of devices, including graphical processing units and quantum processing units.",Human
"A physics-informed neural network (PINN) embedded with the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is devised to understand the temporal evolution dynamics of infectious diseases. Firstly, the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on synthetic data as generated from the numerical solution of the susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model. Then, the method is applied to COVID-19 data reported for Germany and shows that it can accurately identify and predict virus spread trends. The results indicate that an incomplete physics-informed model can approach more complicated dynamics efficiently. Thus, the present work demonstrates the high potential of using machine learning methods, e.g., PINNs, to study and predict epidemic dynamics in combination with compartmental models.",Human
"Dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (D-FFOCT) has recently emerged as an invaluable live label-free and non-invasive imaging modality able to image subcellular biological structures and their metabolic activity within complex 3D samples. However, D-FFOCT suffers from fringe artefacts when imaging nearby reflective surfaces and is highly sensitive to vibrations. Here, we present interface Self-Referenced (iSR) D-FFOCT, an alternative configuration to D-FFOCT that takes advantage of the presence of the sample coverslip in between the sample and the objective by using it as a defocused reference arm, thus avoiding the aforementioned artefacts. We demonstrate the ability of iSR D-FFOCT to image 2D fibroblast cell cultures, which are among the flattest mammalian cells.",Human
"Owing to the analogies between the problem of wealth redistribution with taxation in a multi-agent society, we introduce and discuss a kinetic model describing the statistical distributions in time of the sizes of groups of biological systems with prey-predator dynamic. While the evolution of the mean values is shown to be driven by a classical Lotka-Volterra system of differential equations, it is shown that the time evolution of the probability distributions of the size of groups of the two interacting species is heavily dependent both on a kinetic redistribution operator and the degree of randomness present in the system. Numerical experiments are given to clarify the time-behavior of the distributions of groups of the species.",Human
"Motility is an essential factor for an organism's survival and diversification. With the advent of novel single-cell technologies, analytical frameworks and theoretical methods, we can begin to probe the complex lives of microscopic motile organisms and answer the intertwining biological and physical questions of how these diverse lifeforms navigate their surroundings. Herein, we give an overview of different experimental, analytical, and mathematical methods used to study a suite of microscale motility mechanisms across different scales encompassing molecular-, individual- to population-level. We identify transferable techniques, pressing challenges, and future directions in the field. This review can serve as a starting point for researchers who are interested in exploring and quantifying the movements of organisms in the microscale world.",Human
"Living systems face both environmental complexity and limited access to free-energy resources. Survival under these conditions requires a control system that can activate, or deploy, available perception and action resources in a context specific way. We show here that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the free-energy principle (and hence can be considered Bayesian prediction-error minimizers), their control flow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control systems can be implmented within the general framework of quantum topological neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling biological systems at multiple scales.",Human
We expand the calculation of the upper bound on epidemic overshoot in SIR models to account for nonlinear incidence. We lay out the general procedure and restrictions to perform the calculation analytically for nonlinear functions in the number of susceptibles. We demonstrate the procedure by working through several examples and also numerically study what happens to the upper bound on overshoot when nonlinear incidence manifests in the form of epidemic dynamics over a contact network. We find that both steeper incidence terms and larger contact heterogeneity can increase the range of communicable diseases at which the overshoot remains a relatively large public health hazard.,Human
"The recent discovery of the striking sheet-like multicellular choanoflagellate species $Choanoeca~flexa$ that dynamically interconverts between two hemispherical forms of opposite orientation raises fundamental questions in cell and evolutionary biology, as choanoflagellates are the closest living relatives of animals. It similarly motivates questions in fluid and solid mechanics concerning the differential swimming speeds in the two states and the mechanism of curvature inversion triggered by changes in the geometry of microvilli emanating from each cell. Here we develop fluid dynamical and mechanical models to address these observations and show that they capture the main features of the swimming, feeding, and inversion of $C.~flexa$ colonies.",Human
"We present a microscopic model of replicator dynamics with strategy-dependent time delays. In such a model, new players are born from parents who interacted and received payoffs in the past. In the case of small delays, we use Taylor expansion to get ordinary differential equations for frequencies of strategies with time delays as parameters. We apply our technique to get analytic expressions for interior stationary states in two games: Snowdrift and Stag-hunt. We show that interior stationary states depend continuously upon time delays. Our analytic formulas for stationary states approximate well exact numerical results for small time delays.",Human
"The growing interest in bio-inspired materials is driven by the need for increasingly targeted and efficient devices that also have a low ecological impact. These devices often use specially developed materials (e.g., polymers, aptamers, monoclonal antibodies) capable of carrying out the process of recognizing and capturing a specific target in a similar way to biomaterials of natural origin. In this article, we present two case studies, in which the target is a biomolecule of medical interest, in particular, {\alpha}-thrombin and cytokine IL-6. In these examples, different biomaterials are compared to establish, with a theoretical-computational procedure known as proteotronics, which of them has the greatest potential for use in a biodevice.",Human
"This is a provisional status report of biophysics activities in Africa. We start by highlighting the importance of biophysics research and development for every country's economy in the 21st century. Yet, the amount of biophysics activity in African countries varies between woefully little to nothing at all. We present a scope of biophysics research on the continent based on a pilot scientometrics study. We discuss a number of existing multinational programmes and infrastructure initiatives and propose a Pan African Professional Society for Biophysics. We emphasize the need for education, infrastructure and career development, and conclude with a list of suggested recommendations for expedited development of biophysics research on the continent.",Human
"We utilize whole-body Hydra regeneration from a small tissue segment to develop a physics framework for animal morphogenesis. Introducing experimental controls over this process, an external electric field and a drug that blocks gap junctions, allows us to characterize the essential step in the morphological transition - from a spherical shape to an elongated spheroid. We find that spatial fluctuations of the Ca2+ distribution in the Hydra's tissue drive this transition and construct a field-theoretic model that explains the morphological transition as a first-order-like phase transition resulting from the coupling of the Ca2+ field and the tissue's local curvature. Various predictions of this model are verified experimentally.",Human
"We determine the generic consistency, dimension and nondegeneracy of the zero locus over $\mathbb{C}^*$, $\mathbb{R}^*$ and $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ of vertically parametrized systems: parametric polynomial systems consisting of linear combinations of monomials scaled by free parameters. These systems generalize sparse systems with fixed monomial support and freely varying parametric coefficients. As our main result, we establish the equivalence among three key properties: the existence of nondegenerate zeros, the zero set having generically the expected dimension, and the system being generically consistent. Importantly, we prove that checking whether a vertically parametrized system has these properties amounts to an easily computed matrix rank condition.",Human
"Despite rapid progress in live-imaging techniques, many complex biophysical and biochemical systems remain only partially observable, thus posing the challenge to identify valid theoretical models and estimate their parameters from an incomplete set of experimentally accessible time series. Here, we combine sensitivity methods and ranked-choice model selection to construct an automated hidden dynamics inference framework that can discover predictive nonlinear dynamical models for both observable and latent variables from noise-corrupted incomplete data in oscillatory and chaotic systems. After validating the framework for prototypical FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillations, we demonstrate its applicability to experimental data from squid neuron activity measurements and Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reactions, as well as to the Lorenz system in the chaotic regime.",Human
"When a biological system robustly corrects component-level errors, the direct pressure on component performance declines. Components may become less reliable, maintain more genetic variability, or drift neutrally in design, creating the basis for new forms of organismal complexity. This article links the protection-decay dynamic to other aspects of robust and complex systems. Examples include the hourglass pattern of biological development and Doyle's hourglass architecture for robustly complex systems in engineering. The deeply and densely connected wiring architecture in biology's cellular controls and in machine learning's computational neural networks provide another link. By unifying these seemingly different aspects into a unified framework, we gain a new perspective on robust and complex systems.",Human
"In exponential population growth, variability in the timing of individual division events and environmental factors (including stochastic inoculation) compound to produce variable growth trajectories. In several stochastic models of exponential growth we show power-law relationships that relate variability in the time required to reach a threshold population size to growth rate and inoculum size. Population-growth experiments in E. coli and S. aureus with inoculum sizes ranging between 1 and 100 are consistent with these relationships. We quantify how noise accumulates over time, finding that it encodes -- and can be used to deduce -- information about the early growth rate of a population.",Human
"The stable cooperation ratio of spatial evolutionary games has been widely studied using simulations or approximate analysis methods. However, sometimes such ``stable'' cooperation ratios obtained via approximate methods might not be actually stable, but correspond to quasi-equilibriums instead. We find that various classic game models, like the evolutionary snowdrift game, evolutionary prisoner's dilemma, and spatial public goods game on square lattices and scale-free networks, exhibit the phase transition in convergence time to the equilibrium state. Moreover, mathematical principles are provided to explain the phase transition of convergence time and quasi-equilibrium of cooperation ratio. The findings explain why and when cooperation and defection have a long-term coexistence.",Human
"The organization of cells within tissues plays a vital role in various biological processes, including development and morphogenesis. As a result, understanding how cells self-organize in tissues has been an active area of research. In our study, we explore a mechanistic model of cellular organization that represents cells as force dipoles that interact with each other via the tissue, which we model as an elastic medium. By conducting numerical simulations using this model, we are able to observe organizational features that are consistent with those obtained from vertex model simulations. This approach provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern cellular organization within tissues, which can help us better understand the processes involved in development and disease.",Human
"We analyze the changes in the vicinal acidity (pH) at a spherical amphiphilic membrane. The membrane is assumed to contain solvent accessible, embedded, dissociable, charge regulated moieties. Basing our approach on the linear Debye-H\""uckel as well as the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory, together with the general Frumkin-Fowler-Guggenheim adsorption isotherm model of the charge regulation process, we analyse and review the dependence of the local pH on the position, as well as bulk electrolyte concentration, bulk pH and curvature of the amphiphilic single membrane vesicle. With appropriately chosen adsorption parameters of the charge regulation model, we find a good agreement with available experimental data.",Human
"A biological transition from a state N to a state T is characterized by a rearrangement of the gene expression profile in the system, quantitatively measured through the differential expression of genes. In contrast, changes in genetic pathways are usually evaluated by means of hypothesis testing schemes. We introduce a quantitative measure in order to evaluate the average fold-change of genetic pathways in biological transitions and applied it to characterize in general grounds the transition from a normal tissue to a tumor. Additionally, we study the transformation from primary to metastatic melanoma. Gene expression data from the TCGA portal for 16 tumors and the Reactome compilation of pathways are used for this purpose.",Human
"This paper proposes a framework for optimising the adaptation and attunement of a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) with its environments. The tendency towards stability can be explained by minimising free energy but high variability, noise, and over-specialized rigidity can lead to a ""stuck state"" in a CAS. Without perturbation (increasing free energy), the system remains stuck and unable to adapt to changing circumstances. The paper introduces the concept of 'psychotic' Markov blankets to understand and specify factors contributing to maladjustment conditions moving away from the minimum stuck state. The paper offers directions for optimising adaptation and attunement to be applied to real-world problems, from cells to behaviour, societies and ecosystems.",Human
"Many variants of RNA, DNA, and even proteins can be considered semiflexible polymers, where bending stiffness, as a type of energetic penalty, competes with attractive van der Waals forces in structure formation processes. Here, we systematically investigate the effect of the bending stiffness on ground-state conformations of a generic coarse-grained model for semiflexible polymers. This model possesses multiple transition barriers. Therefore, we employ advanced generalized-ensemble Monte Carlo methods to search for the lowest-energy conformations. As the formation of distinct versatile ground-state conformations, including compact globules, rod-like bundles, and toroids, strongly depends on the strength of the bending restraint, we also performed a detailed analysis of contact and distance maps.",Human
"Laser-induced alignment of particles and molecules was long envisioned to support three-dimensional structure determination using ""single-molecule diffraction"" with x-ray free-electron lasers [PRL 92, 198102 (2004)]. However, the alignment of isolated macromolecules has not yet been demonstrated, also because quantitative modeling is very expensive. We computationally demonstrated that the alignment of nanorods and proteins is possible with standard laser technology. We performed a comprehensive analysis on the dependence of the degree of alignment on molecular properties and experimental details, e.g., particle temperature and laser-pulse energy. Considering the polarizability anisotropy of about 150,000 proteins, our analysis revealed that most of these proteins can be aligned using realistic experimental parameters.",Human
"We study two models of overdamped self-propelled disks in two dimensions, with and without aligning interactions. Active mesoscale flows leading to chaotic advection emerge in both models in the homogeneous dense fluid away from dynamical arrest, forming streams and vortices reminiscent of multiscale flow patterns in turbulence. We show that the characteristics of these flows do not depend on the specific details of the active fluids, and result from the competition between crowding effects and persistent propulsions. Our results suggest that dense active fluids present a type of `active turbulence' distinct from collective flows reported in other types of active systems.",Human
"Biological microswimmers such as bacteria and sperm cells often encounter complex biological fluid environments. Here we use the well-known squirmer microswimmer model to show the importance of the local fluid microstructure and non-continuum effects on their swimming speed in different polymeric and filamentous fluids. Surprisingly, we find that different squirmer types move at considerably different speed in filamentous fluids which cannot be explained by existing continuum models, but by considering the local fluid and polymer properties around the squirmers. Furthermore, direct squirmer-polymer interactions slow down in particular pushers by trapping large stiff filaments in a self-generated recirculation region in front of them.",Human
"This article presents the solution of the fractional SIR epidemic model using the Laplace residual power series method. We introduce the fractional SIR model in the sense of Caputo's derivative, it is presented by three fractional differential equations, in which the third one depends on the first coupled equations. The Laplace residual power series method is implemented in this research to solve the proposed model, in which we present the solution in a form of convergent series expansion that converges rapidly to the exact one. We analyze the results and compare the obtained approximate solutions to those obtained from other methods. Figures and tables are illustrated to show the efficiency of the LRPSM in handling the proposed SIR model.",Human
"Protein synthesis is an important determinant of microbial growth and response that demands a high amount of metabolic and biosynthetic resources. Despite these costs, microbial species from different taxa and habitats massively synthesize proteins that are not utilized in the conditions they currently experience. Based on resource allocation models, recent studies have begun to reconcile the costs and benefits of these conditionally unutilized proteins (CUPs) in the context of varying environmental conditions. Such massive synthesis of CUPs is crucial to consider in different areas of modern microbiology, from the systematic investigation of cell physiology, via the prediction of evolution in laboratory and natural environments, to the rational design of strains in biotechnology applications.",Human
"Avian prestin is sensitive to membrane thickness as much as mammalian prestin, which undergoes conformational transitions in membrane area and thereby drives length changes of the cylindrical cell body of outer hair cells. The membrane thickness dependence of mammalian prestin stems from changes in hydrophobic profile in conformational states, accompanied by changes in their membrane area. Even though such area changes are not detected for avian prestin, it nonetheless bends hair bundles of avian short hair cells. Here it is suggested that the motile function of avian prestin can be based on conformational transitions involving shearing deformation of the membrane protein, which also leads to membrane thickness sensitivity.",Human
"Gene regulatory networks are powerful tools for modeling interactions among genes to regulate their expression for homeostasis and differentiation. Single-cell sequencing offers a unique opportunity to build these networks with high-resolution data. There are many proposed computational methods to build these networks using single-cell data and different approaches are followed to benchmark these methods. In this review, we lay the basic terminology in the field and define the success metrics. Next, we present an overview of approaches for benchmarking computational gene regulatory network approaches for building gene regulatory networks and point out gaps and future directions in this regard.",Human
"In neural information processing, an input modulates neural dynamics to generate a desired output.   To unravel the dynamics and underlying neural connectivity enabling such input-output association, we proposed an exactly soluble neural-network model with a connectivity matrix explicitly consisting of inputs and required outputs.   An analytic form of the response upon the input is derived, whereas three distinctive types of responses including chaotic dynamics as bifurcation against input strength are obtained depending on the neural sensitivity and number of inputs.   Optimal performance is achieved at the onset of chaos, and the relevance of the results to cognitive dynamics is discussed.",Human
"This review article is the second part of the project ``Selected Topics of Social Physics"". The first part has been devoted to equilibrium systems. The present part considers nonequilibrium systems. The style of the paper combines the features of a tutorial and a review, which, from one side, makes it easy to read for nonspecialists aiming at grasping the basics of social physics, and from the other side, describes several rather recent original models containing new ideas that could be of interest to experienced researchers in the field. The present material is based on the lectures that the author had been giving during several years at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich).",Human
"We study the roles of social and individual learning on outcomes of the Minority Game model of a financial market. Social learning occurs via agents adopting the strategies of their neighbours within a social network, while individual learning results in agents changing their strategies without input from other agents. In particular, we show how social learning can undermine efficiency of the market due to negative frequency dependent selection and loss of strategy diversity. The latter of which can lock the population into a maximally inefficient state. We show how individual learning can rescue a population engaged in social learning from such inefficiencies.",Human
"We present PolyHoop, a lightweight standalone C++ implementation of a mechanical model to simulate the dynamics of soft particles and cellular tissues in two dimensions. With only few geometrical and physical parameters, PolyHoop is capable of simulating a wide range of particulate soft matter systems: from biological cells and tissues to vesicles, bubbles, foams, emulsions, and other amorphous materials. The soft particles or cells are represented by continuously remodeling, non-convex, high-resolution polygons that can undergo growth, division, fusion, aggregation, and separation. With PolyHoop, a tissue or foam consisting of a million cells with high spatial resolution can be simulated on conventional laptop computers.",Human
"In this article we present a machine learning model to obtain fast and accurate estimates of the molecular Hessian matrix. In this model, based on a random forest, the second derivatives of the energy with respect to redundant internal coordinates are learned individually. The internal coordinates together with their specific representation guarantee rotational and translational invariance. The model is trained on a subset of the QM7 data set, but is shown to be applicable to larger molecules picked from the QM9 data set. From the predicted Hessian it is also possible to obtain reasonable estimates of the vibrational frequencies, normal modes and zero point energies of the molecules.",Human
"We present a tutorial on setting-up the oxDNA coarse-grained model for simulations of DNA and RNA nanotechnology. The model is a popular tool used both by theorists and experimentalists to simulate nucleic acid systems both in biology and nanotechnology settings. The tutorial is aimed at new users asking ""Where should I start if I want to use oxDNA"". We assume no prior background in using the model. This tutorial shows basic examples that can get a novice user started with the model, and points the prospective user towards additional reading and online resources depending on which aspect of the model they are interested in pursuing.",Human
"Recent studies show that newly sampled monkeypox virus (MPXV) genomes exhibit mutations consistent with Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Catalytic Polypeptide-like3 (APOBEC3)-mediated editing, compared to MPXV genomes collected earlier. It is unclear whether these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) result from APOBEC3-induced editing or are a consequence of genetic drift within one or more MPXV animal reservoirs. We develop a simple method based on a generalization of the General-Time-Reversible (GTR) model to show that the observed SNPs are likely the result of APOBEC3-induced editing. The statistical features allow us to extract lineage information and estimate evolutionary events.",Human
"PHF5A is a member of the zinc-finger proteins. To advance knowledge on their role in carcinogenesis, data from experimental studies, animal models and clinical studies in different tumorigenesis have been reviewed. Furthermore, PHF5A as an oncogenic function, is frequently expressed in tumor cells and a potential prognostic marker for different cancers. PHF5A is implicated in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration and metastasis. Knockdown of PHF5A prevented the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Here, the role of PHF5A in different cancers and their possible mechanism in relation to recent literature is reviewed and discussed. However, there is an open promising perspective to their therapeutic management for different cancer types.",Human
"The genome-scale metabolic model with protein constraint (PC-model) has been increasingly popular for microbial metabolic simulations.

"Molecular chaperones are vital proteins that maintain protein homeostasis by assisting in protein folding, activation, degradation, and stress protection. Among them, heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) stands out as an essential proteostasis hub in eukaryotes, chaperoning hundreds of ""clients"" (substrates). After decades of research, several ""known unknowns"" about the molecular function of Hsp90 remain unanswered, hampering rational drug design for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative and other diseases. We highlight three fundamental open questions, reviewing the current state of the field for each, and discuss new opportunities, including single-molecule technologies, to answer the known unknowns of the Hsp90 chaperone.",Human
"When employing mechanistic models to study biological phenomena, practical parameter identifiability is important for making accurate predictions across wide range of unseen scenarios, as well as for understanding the underlying mechanisms. In this work we use a profile likelihood approach to investigate parameter identifiability for four extensions of the Fisher--KPP model, given experimental data from a cell invasion assay. We show that more complicated models tend to be less identifiable, with parameter estimates being more sensitive to subtle differences in experimental procedures, and that they require more data to be practically identifiable. As a result, we suggest that parameter identifiability should be considered alongside goodness-of-fit and model complexity as criteria for model selection.",Human
"Traditional linear stability analysis based on matrix diagonalization is a computationally intensive $O(n^3)$ process for $n$-dimensional systems of differential equations, posing substantial limitations for the exploration of Turing systems of pattern formation where an additional wave-number parameter needs to be investigated. In this study, we introduce an efficient $O(n)$ technique that leverages Gershgorin's theorem to determine upper limits on regions of parameter space and the wave number beyond which Turing instabilities cannot occur. This method offers a streamlined avenue for exploring the phase diagrams of other complex multiparametric models, such as those found in systems biology.",Human
"The COVID-19 pandemic has globally posed numerous health challenges, notably the emergence of post-COVID-19 cardiovascular complications. This study addresses this by utilizing data-driven machine learning models to predict such complications in 352 post-COVID-19 patients from Iraq. Clinical data, including demographics, comorbidities, lab results, and imaging, were collected and used to construct predictive models. These models, leveraging various machine learning algorithms, demonstrated commendable performance in identifying patients at risk. Early detection through these models promises timely interventions and improved outcomes. In conclusion, this research underscores the potential of data-driven machine learning for predicting post-COVID-19 cardiovascular complications, emphasizing the need for continued validation and research in diverse clinical settings.",Human
"Currently, a large number of stored tissue samples are unavailable for spectroscopic study without the time consuming and destructive process of paraffin removal. Instead, a structurally sensitive technique, sum frequency generation, and a chemically sensitive technique, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering enables imaging through the paraffin. This method is demonstrated by imaging collagen in mouse tibia. We introduce a statistical method for separating images by quality and, with the aid of machine learning, distinguish osteoporotic and healthy bone. This method has the potential to verify the results of previous studies and reduce new sample production by allowing retesting results with spectroscopy.",Human
"Social insects have evolved a variety of architectural formations. Bees and wasps are well known for their ability to achieve compact structures by building hexagonal cells. Polistes wattii, an open nesting paper wasp species, builds planar hexagonal structures. Here, using the pair correlation function approach, we show that their nests exhibit short-range hexagonal order no long-range order akin to amorphous materials. Hexagonal orientational order was well preserved globally. We also show the presence of topological defects such as dislocations (pentagon-heptagon disclination pairs) and Stone-Wales quadrupoles, and discuss how these defects were organized in the nest, thereby restoring order. Furthermore, we suggest the possible role of such defects in shaping nesting architectures of other social insect species.",Human
"We study the viscoelastic properties of highly entangled, flexible, self-propelled polymers using Brownian dynamics simulations. Our results show that the active motion of the polymer increases the height of the stress plateau by orders of magnitude due to the emergence of grip forces at entanglement points. Identifying the activity-induced energy of a single polymer and the ratio of polymer length to self-propulsion velocity as relevant energy and time scales, we find the stress autocorrelation functions collapse across P\'eclet numbers. We predict that the long-time viscosity scales with polymer length squared $\sim L^2$, in contrast to equilibrium counterparts $\sim L^3$. These insights offer prospects for designing new materials with activity-responsive mechanical properties.",Human
"Quantification of measurement uncertainty is crucial for robust scientific inference, yet accurate estimates of this uncertainty remain elusive for ecological measures of diversity. Here, we address this longstanding challenge by deriving a closed-form unbiased estimator for the sampling variance of Simpson's diversity index. In numerical tests the estimator consistently outperforms existing approaches, particularly for applications in which species richness exceeds sample size. We apply the estimator to quantify biodiversity loss in marine ecosystems and to demonstrate ligand-dependent contributions of T cell receptor chains to specificity, illustrating its versatility across fields. The novel estimator provides researchers with a reliable method for comparing diversity between samples, essential for quantifying biodiversity trends and making informed conservation decisions.",Human
"The problem of selecting a model given a set of candidates remains a challenging one that pervades many scientific fields. We employ techniques from the theory of Lie groups to analyse the symmetries in differential equation models of population growth, with the aim of informing the model selection problem. To illustrate the use of Lie symmetries in model selection, we apply them to simulated data and to coral reef data from the Great Barrier Reef, demonstrating that the trivial symmetries can distinguish between candidate models. A method for finding locally optimal parameters for multi-parameter symmetries is presented, and the paper concludes with related results, some open problems, and avenues of further research.",Human
"We present a theory for phase-separated liquid coacervates with salt, taking into account spatial heterogeneities and interfacial profiles. We find that charged layers of alternating sign can form around the interface while the bulk phases remain approximately charge-neutral. We show that the salt concentration regulates the number of layers and the amplitude of the layer's charge density and electrostatic potential. Such charged layers can either repel or attract single-charged molecules diffusing across the interface. Our theory could be relevant for artificial systems and biomolecular condensates in cells. Our work suggests that interfaces of biomolecular condensates could mediate charge-specific transport similar to membrane-bound compartments.",Human
"Colloidal self-assembly allows rational design of structures on the micrometer and submicrometer scale. One architecture that can generate complete 3D photonic band gaps is the diamond cubic lattice, which has remained difficult to realize at length scales comparable to the wavelength of visible or ultraviolet light. Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional photonic crystals self-assembled from DNA origami that act as precisely programmable patchy colloids. Our DNA-based nanoscale tetrapods crystallize into a rod-connected diamond cubic lattice with a periodicity of 170 nm. This structure serves as a scaffold for atomic layer deposition of high refractive index materials such as TiO$_2$, yielding a tunable photonic band gap in the near-ultraviolet.",Human
"The minimal 3-state scheme of kinetic cooperativity of monomeric enzymes is subjected to detailed analysis. The rigorous criteria of positive cooperativity and its sigmoidal version are established in terms of the system parameters (rate constants). It is shown that the cooperativity extent is especially sensitive to the rates and direction of the exchange between conformational states of the free enzyme. However, no necessity of the ""kinetic resonance"" (or, moreover, its generality claimed recently) for enhancing cooperativity is revealed. Overall, while the minimal 3-state model serves well for qualitative understanding the origin of kinetic cooperativity, it is hardly suitable for quantitative describing reactions of real enzymes, as it is shown with the case of glucokinase.",Human
"We introduce oxNA, a new model for the simulation of DNA-RNA hybrids which is based on two previously developed coarse-grained models$\unicode{x2014}$oxDNA and oxRNA. The model naturally reproduces the physical properties of hybrid duplexes including their structure, persistence length and force-extension characteristics. By parameterising the DNA-RNA hydrogen bonding interaction we fit the model's thermodynamic properties to experimental data using both average-sequence and sequence-dependent parameters. To demonstrate the model's applicability we provide three examples of its use$\unicode{x2014}$calculating the free energy profiles of hybrid strand displacement reactions, studying the resolution of a short R-loop and simulating RNA-scaffolded wireframe origami.",Human
"In a study conducted in Singapore, a country prone to dengue outbreaks due to its climate and urban population, researchers examined the effectiveness of releasing male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia (wAlbB strain) to reduce dengue transmission. These infected males, when mating with wild-type females, produced non-viable eggs, leading to vector suppression. Extensive field trials involving over 600,000 residents in four townships were conducted from 2018 to 2022. The results showed a 57% decline in total dengue incidence and a 64% decline in clustered dengue incidence. This approach offers promise for large-scale dengue control in regions facing rising dengue cases, providing a critical solution in combating the disease.",Human
"What determines biodiversity in nature is a prominent issue in ecology, especially in biotic resource systems that are typically devoid of cross-feeding. Here, we show that by incorporating pairwise encounters among consumer individuals within the same species, a multitude of consumer species can self-organize to coexist in a well-mixed system with one or a few biotic resource species. The coexistence modes can manifest as either stable steady states or self-organized oscillations. Importantly, all coexistence states are robust to stochasticity, whether employing the stochastic simulation algorithm or individual-based modeling. Our model quantitatively illustrates species distribution patterns across a wide range of ecological communities and can be broadly used to explain biodiversity in many biotic resource systems.",Human
"This series of papers models the dynamics of a large set of interacting neurons within the framework of statistical field theory. The system is described using a two-field model. The first field represents the neuronal activity, while the second field accounts for the interconnections between cells. This model is derived by translating a probabilistic model involving a large number of interacting cells into a field formalism. The current paper focuses on deriving the background fields of the system, which describe the potential equilibria in terms of interconnected groups. Dynamically, we explore the perturbation of these background fields, leading to processes such as activation, association, and reactivation of groups of cells.",Human
"A wide array of biological systems can navigate in shallow gradients of chemoattractant with remarkable precision. Whilst previous approaches model such systems using coarse-grained chemical density profiles, we construct a dynamical model consisting of a chemotactic cell responding to discrete cue particles. For a cell without internal memory, we derive an effective velocity with which the cell approaches a point source of cue particles. We find that the effective velocity becomes negative beyond some homing radius, which represents an upper bound on the distance within which chemotaxis can be reliably performed. This work lays the foundation for the analytical characterisation of more detailed models of chemotaxis.",Human
We compare three different setups for measuring cell-cell adhesion. We show that the measured strength depends on the type of setup that is used. For identical cells different assays measure different detachment forces. This can be understood from the fact that cell-cell detachment is a global property of the system. We also analyse the role of external force and line tension on contact angle and cell-cell detachment. Comparison with experiment suggests that the current data are essentially dynamical in nature. We dedicate this article to Fyl Pincus who for many of us is an example to be followed not only for outstanding science but also for a marvelous human behavior.,Human
"Understanding the evolution of cooperation is pivotal in biology and social science. Public resources sharing is a common scenario in the real world. In our study, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation on a regular graph with degree $k$, introducing the presence of a third strategy, namely the benevolence, who does not evolve over time, but provides a fixed benefit to all its neighbors. We find that the presence of the benevolence can foster the development of cooperative behavior and it follows a simple rule: $b/c > k - p_S(k-1)$. Our results provide new insights into the evolution of cooperation in structured populations.",Human
"In this study, 529 variables extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of 922 breast cancer patients have been evaluated, focusing on distinguishing between recurrent and non-recurrent cases, as well as those with and without metastasis. Special emphasis is placed on the differences among invasive breast cancer subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 positive, and TNBC). The accurate identification of the subtype is crucial as it impacts both treatment and prognosis. The analysis is based on the dataset from Saha et al., highlighting key factors for predicting recurrences and metastases, providing valuable information for proper monitoring and the selection of effective treatments.",Human
"Running world records (WRs) contain information about physiological characteristics that determine running performance. The progression of WRs over time encode the evolution of these characteristics. Here we demonstrate that a previously established model for running performance describes WRs since 1918 for men and since 1984 for women with high accuracy. The physiological parameters extracted from WR for each year are interpreted in terms of historical changes in training approaches and corresponding physiological adaptions, technological progress, social effects, and also the use of performance enhancing drugs. While the last two decades had witnessed stagnation of WRs, recent improvements in endurance have enable new WRs, presumably aided by recent technological advancements.",Human
"Although defocus can be used to generate partial phase contrast in transmission electron microscope images, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can be further improved by the development of phase plates which increase contrast by applying a phase shift to the unscattered part of the electron beam. Many approaches have been investigated, including the ponderomotive interaction between light and electrons. We review the recent successes achieved with this method in high-resolution, single-particle cryo-EM. We also review the status of using pulsed or near-field enhanced laser light as alternatives, along with approaches that use scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with a segmented detector rather than a phase plate.",Human
"This study proposes an innovative approach to analyze spatial patterns of behavior by integrating information in weighted Voronoi diagrams. The objective of the research is to analyze the temporal distribution of an experimental subject in different regions of a given space, with the aim of identifying significant areas of interest. The methodology employed involves dividing the experimental space, determining representative points, and assigning weights based on the cumulative time the subject spends in each region. This process results in a set of generator points along with their respective weights, thus defining the Voronoi diagram. The study also presents a detailed and advanced perspective for understanding spatial behavioral patterns in experimental contexts.",Human
"Wedemonstratedeep-learningneuralnetwork(NN)-baseddynamicopticalcoherence tomography (DOCT), which generates high-quality logarithmic-intensity-variance (LIV) DOCT images from only four OCT frames. The NN model is trained for tumor spheroid samples using a customized loss function: the weighted mean absolute error. This loss function enables highly accurate LIV image generation. The fidelity of the generated LIV images to the ground truth LIV images generated using 32 OCT frames is examined via subjective image observation and statistical analysis of image-based metrics. Fast volumetric DOCT imaging with an acquisition time of 6.55 s/volume is demonstrated using this NN-based method.",Human
"We consider Markov jump processes on a graph described by a rate matrix that depends on various control parameters. We derive explicit expressions for the static responses of edge currents and steady-state probabilities. We show that they are constrained by the graph topology (i.e. the incidence matrix) by deriving response relations (i.e. linear constraints linking the different responses) and topology-dependent bounds. For unicyclic networks, all scaled current responses are between zero and one and must sum to one. Applying these results to stochastic thermodynamics, we derive explicit expressions for the static response of fundamental currents (which carry the full dissipation) to fundamental thermodynamic forces (which drive the system away from equilibrium).",Human
"Our understanding of past evolutionary change is often based on reconstructions based on incomplete data, raising fundamental questions about the degree to which we can make reliable inferences about past evolutionary processes. This was demonstrated by Louca and Pennell (2020), who showed that each pure-birth process can be generated by an infinite number of birth-death processes. Here, I explore what it means to reconstruct past evolutionary change with three approaches from measure theory, group theory, and homotopy theory to better understand structural constraint and origins of (non)identifiability. As an example, the developed framework is applied to the case of birth-death processes.",Human
"Quantification of lymphoid aggregates including tertiary lymphoid structures with germinal centers in histology images of cancer is a promising approach for developing prognostic and predictive tissue biomarkers. In this article, we provide recommendations for identifying lymphoid aggregates in tissue sections from routine pathology workflows such as hematoxylin and eosin staining. To overcome the intrinsic variability associated with manual image analysis (such as subjective decision making, attention span), we recently developed a deep learning-based algorithm called HookNet-TLS to detect lymphoid aggregates and germinal centers in various tissues. Here, we additionally provide a guideline for using manually annotated images for training and implementing HookNet-TLS for automated and objective quantification of lymphoid aggregates in various cancer types.",Human
"What could metacognition look like in simple physical terms? We define metacognition as having beliefs about beliefs, which can be articulated very simply using the language of statistical physics and Bayesian mechanics. We introduce a typology between cognitive and metacognitive particles and develop an example of a metacognitive particle. This can be generalized to provide examples of higher forms of metacognition: i.e. particles having beliefs about beliefs about beliefs and so forth. We conclude by saying that the typology of particles laid down in the target article seems promising, for seemingly enabling a physics of cognition that builds upon and refines the free energy principle, toward a physical description of entities that specifically possess higher forms of cognition.",Human
"We present a diffusion-based, generative model for conformer generation. Our model is focused on the reproduction of bonded structure and is constructed from the associated terms traditionally found in classical force fields to ensure a physically relevant representation. Techniques in deep learning are used to infer atom typing and geometric parameters from a training set. Conformer sampling is achieved by taking advantage of recent advancements in diffusion-based generation. By training on large, synthetic data sets of diverse, drug-like molecules optimized with the semiempirical GFN2-xTB method, high accuracy is achieved for bonded parameters, exceeding that of conventional, knowledge-based methods. Results are also compared to experimental structures from the Protein Databank (PDB) and Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).",Human
"This article presents a mini-review about the progress in inferring monosynaptic connections from spike trains of multiple neurons over the past twenty years. First, we explain a variety of meanings of ``neuronal connectivity'' in different research areas of neuroscience, such as structural connectivity, monosynaptic connectivity, and functional connectivity. Among these, we focus on the methods used to infer the monosynaptic connectivity from spike data. We then summarize the inference methods based on two main approaches, i.e., correlation-based and model-based approaches. Finally, we describe available source codes for connectivity inference and future challenges. Although inference will never be perfect, the accuracy of identifying the monosynaptic connections has improved dramatically in recent years due to continuous efforts.",Human
"This work examines a field theory for RNA-like molecules in a good solvent. The field theory is based on a lattice model for single- and double-strand RNA with a periodic base sequence, and otherwise contains all known relevant details (polymer types, polymer lengths and interactions). As for the somewhat less explicit $O\left(n\right)$-symmetric model there is a close relation to the conventional one-component branched polymer and the associated Lee-Yang problem. We further elucidate this relation. We derive exact results in the limiting cases of nearly complete denaturation and nearly complete renaturation. The single-strand critical exponent $\nu_{\varphi}$ is calculated in two-loop order.",Human
We report an experimental and numerical investigation to study the role of asymmetry in the expansion-contraction of the acinar wall on the particle transport in the acinus. We model the acinar flow feature using a T-section by appropriately matching the dimensionless numbers to that in the acinus of healthy human subjects. We show that asymmetry in the expansion-contraction process (quantified by $\phi$) is required for chaotic advection. We show the stretch and fold process leading to chaos for a range of $\phi$ and scaled oscillation frequency $Sr$. We show a regime map in this generalize $\phi$ and $Sr$ space and show that most mammalian lungs fall at the boundary of chaotic regime.,Human
"Proprioception is crucial in intuitive control of prosthetic limbs and therefor contributes to intuitive prosthetic use. The agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI) is an prosthetic innovation with enhanced control, reduced pain, and heightened proprioceptive sensation in clinical experiments. Furthermore, studies have addressed surgical techniques to make this myoelectric interface available to a larger group of patients. A narrative review on AMI developmental process, surgical implementations, and validation has been conducted for clinical and pre-clinical experimental research, embedded in a theoretical background on feedback control and proprioception. The closing chapter on magnetomicrometery serves to illustrate how motor control reading, as an example component, can benefit from technical innovations to enhance intuitive prosthetic control in AMI.",Human
"Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. Here, we frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in a complex foodweb lead to harder ill-conditioned problems, manifesting as slow modes on a nearly-degenerate solution landscape. Common dimensionality reduction methods precondition ecological dynamics, by isolating fast relaxation from slow solving timescales that exhibit transient chaos for harder problem instances. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using complexity bounds for constrained optimization. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.",Human
"This study introduces a novel approach, combining substruct counting, $k$-mers, and Daylight-like fingerprints, to expand the representation of chemical structures in SMILES strings. The integrated method generates comprehensive molecular embeddings that enhance discriminative power and information content. Experimental evaluations demonstrate its superiority over traditional Morgan fingerprinting, MACCS, and Daylight fingerprint alone, improving chemoinformatics tasks such as drug classification. The proposed method offers a more informative representation of chemical structures, advancing molecular similarity analysis and facilitating applications in molecular design and drug discovery. It presents a promising avenue for molecular structure analysis and design, with significant potential for practical implementation.",Human
"Within the context of epithelial monolayers, T1 transitions, also known as cell-intercalations, are topological rearrangements of cells that contribute to fluidity of the epithelial monolayers. We use a multi-phase field model to show that the ensemble-averaged flow profile of a T1 transition exhibits a saddle point structure, where large velocities are localised near cells undergoing T1 transitions, contributing to vortical flow. This tissue fluidisation corresponds to the dispersion of cells relative to each other. While the temporal evolution of the mean pair-separation distance between initially neighbouring cells depends on specific model details, the mean pair-separation distance increases linearly with the number of T1 transitions, in a way that is robust to model parameters.",Human
"Ribonucleic acids (RNA) are unique in that they can store genetic information, replicate and perform catalysis. Importantly, RNA molecules are highly dynamic, and thus determining the ensemble of conformations that they populate is crucial not only to elucidate their biological functions, but also for their potential use as therapeutic targets. Computational and experimental techniques provide complementary views on RNA dynamics, and their integration is fundamental to improve the accuracy of computations and the resolution of experiments. Recent exciting developments in this field, were discussed at the CECAM workshop ``RNA dynamics from experimental and computational approaches'', in Paris, June 26-28, 2023. This report outlines key `take-home' messages that emerged during this workshop from the presentations and discussions.",Human
"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an important membrane protein in vertebrates. The function of CFTR is to transport chloride ions across the cell membrane, which is known to require adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Whereas most conventional wisdom suggests that ATP interacts with CFTR purely through random collisions via diffusion, we investigate electrostatic interactions between CFTR and ATP at the mesoscale (10s of Angstroms). We use molecular dynamics to simulate CFTR-ATP interactions in cases where CFTR is bound/unbound from ATP, and we demonstrate an electrostatic potential gradient towards CFTR when ATP is unbound. We additionally compute electrostatic interactions between ATP and the solvent and membrane, which are simulated explicitly.",Human
"We explore a biomimetic model that simulates a cell, with the internal cytoplasm represented by a two-dimensional circular domain and the external cortex by a surrounding ring, both modeled using FitzHugh-Nagumo systems. The external ring is dynamically influenced by a pacemaker-driven wave originating from the internal domain, leading to the emergence of three distinct dynamical states based on the varying strengths of coupling. The range of dynamics observed includes phase patterning, the propagation of phase waves, and interactions between traveling and phase waves. A simplified linear model effectively explains the mechanisms behind the variety of phase patterns observed, providing insights into the complex interplay between a cell's internal and external environments.",Human
"Neuronal dendrites form densely branched tree architectures through which mitochondria must be distributed to supply the cell's energetic needs. Dendritic mitochondria circulate through the tree, undergoing fusion and fission to form clusters of varying sizes. We present a mathematical model for the distribution of such actively-driven particles in a branched geometry. Our model demonstrates that `balanced' trees (wherein cross-sectional area is conserved across junctions and thicker branches support more bushy subtrees) enable symmetric yet distally enriched particle distributions and promote dispersion into smaller clusters. These results highlight the importance of tree architecture and radius-dependent fusion in governing the distribution of neuronal mitochondria.",Human
The characterization of network and biophysical properties from neural spiking activity is an important goal in neuroscience. A framework that provides unbiased inference on causal synaptic interaction and single neural properties has been missing. Here we applied the stochastic dynamics extension of Maximum Entropy -- the Maximum Caliber Principle -- to infer the transition rates of network states. Effective synaptic coupling strength and neuronal response functions for various network motifs can then be computed. The inferred minimal model also enables leading-order reconstruction of inter-spike interval distribution. Our method is tested with numerical simulated spiking networks and applied to data from salamander retina.,Human
"We consider genealogies arising from a Markov population process in which individuals are categorized into a discrete collection of compartments, with the requirement that individuals within the same compartment are statistically exchangeable. When equipped with a sampling process, each such population process induces a time-evolving tree-valued process defined as the genealogy of all sampled individuals. We provide a construction of this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of filter equations. These filter equations can be numerically solved using standard Monte Carlo integration methods. Thus, we obtain statistically efficient likelihood-based inference for essentially arbitrary compartment models based on an observed genealogy of individuals sampled from the population.",Human
"We review the construction and evolution of mathematical models of the Arabidopsis circadian clock, structuring the discussion into two distinct historical phases of modeling strategies: extension and reduction. The extension phase explores the bottom-up assembly of regulatory networks introducing as many components and interactions as possible in order to capture the oscillatory nature of the clock. The reduction phase deals with functional decomposition, distilling complex models to their essential dynamical repertoire. Current challenges in this field, including the integration of spatial considerations and environmental influences like light and temperature, are also discussed. The review emphasizes the ongoing need for models that balance molecular detail with practical simplicity.",Human
"Drawing on the understanding of the logistic map, we propose a simple predator-prey model where predators and prey adapt to each other, leading to the co-evolution of the system. The special dynamics observed in periodic windows contribute to the coexistence of multiple time scales, adding to the complexity of the system. Typical dynamics in ecosystems, such as the persistence and coexistence of population cycles and chaotic behaviors, the emergence of super-long transients, regime shifts, and the quantifying of resilience, are encapsulated within this single model. The simplicity of our model allows for detailed analysis, reinforcing its potential as a conceptual tool for understanding ecosystems deeply.",Human
"We focus on the potential possibilities for supporting Scanning Probe Microscopy measurements, emphasizing the application of Artificial Intelligence, especially Machine Learning as well as quantum computing. It turned out that Artificial Intelligence can be helpful in the experimental processes automation in routine operations, the algorithmic search for good sample regions, and shed light on the structure property relationships. Thus, it contributes to increasing the efficiency and accuracy of optical nanoscopy scanning probes. Moreover, the combination of Artificial Intelligence based algorithms and quantum computing may have a huge potential to increase the practical application of Scanning Probe Microscopy. The limitations were also discussed. Finally, we outline a research path for the improvement of the proposed approach.",Human
"In order to investigate whether the radical pair mechanism (RPM) can explain the effects of telecommunication frequency radiation on reactive oxygen species production, we modelled the effects of oscillating magnetic fields on radical pair systems. Our analysis indicates that the RPM cannot account for the biological effects observed under exposure to telecommunication frequencies due to negligible effects under low-amplitude conditions used in experimental setups. Observable effects on radical pairs at these frequencies would require hyperfine coupling constants that are precisely fine-tuned to large values that far exceed those naturally occurring within biological systems. We conclude that some other mechanism must be responsible for the effects of telecommunication frequency fields in biological systems.",Human
"Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell aggregation. We investigate the dissociation rates of red cell aggregates in extensional flow using hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our findings reveal that aggregate dissociation increases sharply when a critical extension rate is reached which falls within the range of microcirculatory conditions, suggesting that large variations of aggregate sizes should be expected in-vivo. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of red blood cell aggregates in response to extensional stress in microcirculatory networks, provides crucial experimental data to validate theoretical and numerical models, and constitutes the basis for improved evaluation of blood aggregability in clinical contexts.",Human
"This study presents a theoretical model for a self-replicating mechanical system inspired by biological processes within living cells and supported by computer simulations. The model decomposes self-replication into core components, each of which is executed by a single machine constructed from a set of basic block types. Key functionalities such as sorting, copying, and building, are demonstrated. The model provides valuable insights into the constraints of self-replicating systems. The discussion also addresses the spatial and timing behavior of the system, as well as its efficiency and complexity. This work provides a foundational framework for future studies on self-replicating mechanisms and their information-processing applications.",Human
"Since Galileo and (more recently) D'Arcy Thompson, it has been understood that physical processes and constraints influence biological structures and their resulting functions. However these cross-discpline connections -- and their importance to growing scientific discplines such as biophysics -- are rarely tought in introductory physics courses. Here we examine how the laws of physics shape Darwinism evolution through the surface area to volume ratio, an important geometric measure of a structure. We develop conceptual cartoon clicker questions to enhance students' understanding of these interdisciplinary concepts. By connecting abstract physical laws with biological (and technological) applications, our approach aims to help students appreciate the deep connections between physical and biological sciences, thereby enriching the learning experience in introductory physics courses.",Human
"This paper describes a recently developed software called ``TGL-Lambda'' enables quantifying lure attractiveness under a variety of field capture scenarios including mixed lure/trap combinations. TGL-Lambda delivers a flexible approach to simultaneously estimating the {\lambda} value for multiple trap types, accommodating a common situation in ``Mark-release-recapture'' (MRR) experiments in the field. Specifically, where researchers release a known number of marked insects in a field and count how many are recaptured in two to five trap and lure types, and the trap and release locations are known, TGL-Lambda can be used to estimate the attractiveness ({\lambda}) of each of the trap types.",Human
"Based on the SIRD-model a new model including time-delay is proposed for a description of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. All data were analysed by representing all quantities as a function of the susceptible population, as opposed to the usual dependence on time. The total number of deaths could be predicted for the first, second and third wave of the pandemic in Germany with an accuracy of about 10\%, shortly after the maximum of infectious people was reached. By using the presentation in phase space, it could be shown that a classical SEIRD- and SIRD-model with constant parameters will not be able to describe the first wave of the pandemic accurately.",Human
"Ion channels orchestrate the communication between cells and their environment. These are special proteins capable of changing their shape to allow ions to pass through membranes in response to stimuli like membrane tension. As the letters are written and exchanged in the form of ionic currents, the energetic cost of this communication is of interest to many. To this end, we introduce the nanoscale thermodynamics of mechanosensitive ion channels, which amounts to defining work and heat for traces obtained during patch-clamp experiments. We also discuss the interplay between ion channel physics and evolution by showing how information-processing capabilities are coupled with the energy landscapes of channels.",Human
"This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron models using Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point-like models, excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites, introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group, excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.",Human
"The need for organisms to regulate their volume and osmolarity when surrounded by freshwater is a basic physical challenge for many bacteria, protists and algae. Taking inspiration from the contractile vacuole complex found in many protists, we discuss how simple models of active membrane tubes can give insights into the fluid and active ionic transport properties of such systems. We show that a simple membrane tube with unidirectional ion pumps, and passive ion and water channels, forms a large vacuole due to osmotically-driven water flow and that this can be used to actively pump water out of the cell interior. We discuss the use of this system as a possible minimal method for osmoregulation.",Human
"Predicting protein functional characteristics from structure remains a central problem in protein science, with broad implications from understanding the mechanisms of disease to designing novel therapeutics. Unfortunately, current machine learning methods are limited by scarce and biased experimental data, and physics-based methods are either too slow to be useful, or too simplified to be accurate. In this work, we present Loop-Diffusion, an energy based diffusion model which leverages a dataset of general protein loops from the entire protein universe to learn an energy function that generalizes to functional prediction tasks. We evaluate Loop-Diffusion's performance on scoring TCR-pMHC interfaces and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in recognizing binding-enhancing mutations.",Human
"In this paper, a statistical analysis of the performance of a low insulin index, alkaline and functional diet developed by ANTUR evaluated with machine learning techniques is reported. The sample of patients was checked on a regular basis with a BioImpedenziometric (BIA) analysis. The BIA gives about 40 parameters output describing the health status of the patient. The sample of 1626 patients was grouped in clusters with similar characteristics by a neural network algorithm. A study of the behaviour of the BIA parameters evolution over time with respect to the first visit was performed. More than the 75% of the patient that followed the ANTUR diet showed an improvement of the health status.",Human
"Chaos is generic in strongly-coupled recurrent networks of model neurons, and thought to be an easily accessible dynamical regime in the brain. While neural chaos is typically seen as an impediment to robust computation, we show how such chaos might play a functional role in allowing the brain to learn and sample from generative models. We construct architectures that combine a classic model of neural chaos either with a canonical generative modeling architecture or with energy-based models of neural memory. We show that these architectures have appealing properties for sampling, including easy biologically-plausible control of sampling rates via overall gain modulation.",Human
"Agent-based models capture heterogeneity among individuals in a population and are widely used in studies of multi-cellular systems, disease, epidemics and demography to name a few. However, existing frameworks consider discrete time-step simulation or assume that agents' states only change as a result of discrete events. In this note, we present AgentBasedModeling$.$jl, a Julia package for simulating stochastic agent-based population models in continuous time. The tool allows to easily specify and simulate agents evolving through generic continuous-time jump-diffusions and interacting via continuous-rate processes. AgentBasedModeling$.$jl provides a powerful methodology for studying the effects of stochasticity on structured population dynamics.",Human
"Anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with severe adverse remodeling and increased mortality rates. In this study, anterior STEMI patients were treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention and then imaged with cardiac magnetic resonance 1-2 days later. The cine images were analyzed with computational feature-tracking algorithms to assess end-systolic circumferential (ESC) strain. It was found that contractile function is not only depressed in the infarct and border zone regions, but also in the remote myocardium. This is contrary to other types of infarctions where remote myocardium shows enhanced compensatory function. Quantifying ESC could help identify high risk patients.",Human
"In this study, the predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were obtained from Gouda, Jack, Cheddar, and Parmesan cheeses produced in Uganda. The isolates were identified through Gram staining, catalase and oxidase tests, and 16S rDNA sequencing. Approximately 90% of the isolates were cocci (n=192), including Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus. The remaining 10% were identified as rod-shaped bacteria, primarily belonging to the Lactobacillus species (n=23). BLAST analysis revealed that Pediococcus pentosaceus dominated in all cheese samples (23.7%, of the total 114 isolates). This was followed by uncultured bacterium (15.8%), uncultured Pediococcus species (13.2%), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (8.8%) among others",Human
"We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high values of the Lyapunov dimension that change significantly across the region. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.",Human
"Elucidating the functional effect of missense variants is of crucial importance, yet challenging. To understand the impact of such variants, we fine-tuned the ESM2 protein language model to classify 20 protein features at amino acid resolution. We used the resulting models to: 1) identify protein features that are enriched in either pathogenic or benign missense variants, 2) compare the characteristics of proteins with reference or alternate alleles to understand how missense variants affect protein functionality. We show that our model can be used to reclassify some variants of unknown significance. We also demonstrate the usage of our models for understanding the potential effect of variants on protein features.",Human
"A cell routinely responds to one of many competing environmental cues. Does the cell have an intrinsic preference for that cue, or does that cue have the highest extrinsic information content? We introduce a theoretical framework to answer this fundamental question. We derive extrinsic detection limits for four types of directional cues -- external and self-generated chemical gradients, fluid flow, and contact inhibition of locomotion -- and thus predict extrinsic decision boundaries when these cues compete as pairs. Comparing the boundaries to published data from cell migration experiments quantitatively determines the degree to which cell decisions are intrinsic vs. extrinsic, revealing the extent of cells' autonomy and providing interpretation of their response networks.",Human
"Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both to understanding protein function, and for drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles are computationally inefficient, or do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We present walk-Jump Accelerated Molecular ensembles with Universal Noise (JAMUN), a step towards the goal of efficiently sampling the Boltzmann distribution of arbitrary proteins. By extending Walk-Jump Sampling to point clouds, JAMUN enables ensemble generation at orders of magnitude faster rates than traditional molecular dynamics or state-of-the-art ML methods. Further, JAMUN is able to predict the stable basins of small peptides that were not seen during training.",Human
"The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives information flow between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph $C^*$-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger algebra, which captures the diversity of potential information pathways. Coupled with the gauge action, this graph algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of information flow within the network. Specifically, we show that the KMS states of this system yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions, with computational illustrations based on the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network.",Human
"We introduce a graph renormalization procedure based on the coarse-grained Laplacian, which generates reduced-complexity representations for characteristic scales identified through the spectral gap. This method retains both diffusion probabilities and large-scale topological structures, while reducing redundant information, facilitating the analysis of large graphs by decreasing the number of vertices. Applied to graphs derived from EEG recordings of human brain activity, our approach reveals macroscopic properties emerging from neuronal interactions, such as collective behavior in the form of coordinated neuronal activity. Additionally, it shows dynamic reorganization of brain activity across scales, with more generalized patterns during rest and more specialized and scale-invariant activity in the occipital lobe during attention-focused tasks.",Human
"We apply modified diffusion entropy analysis (MDEA) to assess multifractal dimensions of ON time series (ONTS) and complexity synchronization (CS) analysis to infer information transfer among ONs that are part of a network of organ networks (NoONs). The purpose of this paper is to advance the validation, standardization, and repeatability of MDEA and CS analysis of heterogeneous neurophysiological time series data. Results from processing these datasets show that the complexity of brain, heart, and lung ONTS significantly co-vary over time during cognitive task performance but that certain principles, guidelines, and strategies for the application of MDEA analysis need consideration.",Human
"Living cells presumably employ optimized information transfer methods, enabling efficient communication even in noisy environments. As expected, the efficiency of chemical communications between cells depends on the properties of the molecular messenger. Evidence suggests that proteins from narrow ranges of molecular masses have been naturally selected to mediate cellular communications, yet the underlying communication design principles are not understood. Using a simple physical model that considers the cost of chemical synthesis, diffusion, molecular binding, and degradation, we show that optimal mass values exist that ensure efficient communication of various types of signals. Our findings provide insights into the design principles of biological communications and can be used to engineer chemically communicating biomimetic systems.",Human
"Ionizable lipids are essential in developing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for effective messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery. While traditional methods for designing new ionizable lipids are typically time-consuming, deep generative models have emerged as a powerful solution, significantly accelerating the molecular discovery process. However, a practical challenge arises as the molecular structures generated can often be difficult or infeasible to synthesize. This project explores Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based generative models for synthesizable ionizable lipids. Leveraging a synthetically accessible lipid building block dataset and two specialized predictors to guide the search through chemical space, we introduce a policy network guided MCTS generative model capable of producing new ionizable lipids with available synthesis pathways.",Human
"Spatial omics assays allow for the molecular characterisation of cells in their spatial context. Notably, the two main technological streams, imaging-based and high-throughput sequencing-based, can give rise to very different data modalities. The characteristics of the two data types are well known in adjacent fields such as spatial statistics as point patterns and lattice data, and there is a wide range of tools available. This paper discusses the application of spatial statistics to spatially-resolved omics data and in particular, discusses various advantages, challenges, and nuances. This work is accompanied by a vignette, pasta, that showcases the usefulness of spatial statistics in biology using several R packages.",Human
"In this research, we have derived a mathematical model for within human dynamics of COVID-19 infection using delay differential equations. The new model considers a 'latent period' and 'the time for immune response' as delay parameters, allowing us to study the effects of time delays in human COVID-19 infection. We have determined the equilibrium points and analyzed their stability. The disease-free equilibrium is stable when the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is below unity. Stability switch of the endemic equilibrium occurs through Hopf-bifurcation. This study shows that the effect of latent delay is stabilizing whereas immune response delay has a destabilizing nature.",Human
"This report investigates the modular organisation of the Central region in the Drosophila connectome. We identify groups of neurones amongst which information circulates rapidly before spreading to the rest of the network using Infomap. We find that information flows along pathways linking distant neurones, forming modules that span across the brain. Remarkably, these modules, derived solely from neuronal connectivity patterns, exhibit a striking left-right symmetry in their spatial distribution as well as in their connections. We also identify a hierarchical structure at the coarse-grained scale of these modules, demonstrating the directional nature of information flow in the system.",Human
"We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.",Human
"Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. Moreover, they dominate a system's evolution in deciding the selective outcome or shedding light on the preferred mechanism on how a system explores the energy landscape. It is thus crucial to develop techniques to quantify these metastabilities hence uncovering key details of the energy landscape. Here, we propose a powerful method by leveraging a many-body Arrhenius law that detects the metastabilites in an escape problem, involving interacting particles with excluded volume confined to a complex energy landscape. Observing transport in colloidal systems or translocation of macromolecules through biological pores can be an ideal test bed to verify our results.",Human
"The light scattering experiment establishes a relationship between refractive index fluctuations and fractal dimension in weakly scattering tissue-like media. Based on the box-counting approach, an analytical model is developed and shows that the fractal dimension has a functional dependency on the structural disorder or refractive index fluctuation for short-range correlation and approximately linearly depends on each other for tissue-like media. Several parametric imaging systems can be connected using this approach. Further, tissue's weak multifractality optical scattering is explored using the box-counting method. It is shown that with a functional transformation, the distribution follows lognormal distributions.",Human
"We extend the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to a network-based framework where the degree distribution of nodes follows a Poisson distribution. This extension incorporates an additional parameter representing the mean node degree, allowing for the inclusion of heterogeneity in contact patterns. Using this enhanced model, we analyze epidemic data from the 2018-20 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, employing a survival approach combined with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. Our results suggest that network-based models can more effectively capture the heterogeneity of epidemic dynamics compared to traditional compartmental models, without introducing unduly overcomplicated compartmental framework.",Human
"Dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (DFFOCT) has recently emerged as an invaluable label-free microscopy technique, owing to its sensitivity to cell activity, as well as speed and sectioning ability. However, the quality of DFFOCT images are often degraded due to phase noise and fringe artifacts. In this work, we present a new implementation named Rolling-Phase (RP) DFFOCT, in which the reference arm is slowly scanned over magnitudes exceeding 2$\pi$. We demonstrate mathematically and experimentally that it shows superior image quality while enabling to extract both static and dynamic contrast simultaneously. We showcase RP DFFOCT on monkey retinal explant, and demonstrate its ability to better resolve subcellular structures, including intranuclear activity.",Human
"About 4 billion years ago, the Earth probably fulfilled the environmental conditions necessary to favour the transition from primitive chemistry to life. Based on a theoretical hairpin duplication origin of tRNAs and their putative peptide-coding capability before ribosomes existed, here I postulate that, at this hypothetical environment, Earth's daily temperature cycles could have provided a unique planetary thermocycler to create self-replicating RNA hairpins that simultaneously templated amino acids polymerization in a primordial PCR well of prebiotic molecules. This early RNA hairpin-peptide interaction could have established a reciprocal nucleopeptide replicator that paved the way for catalytic translation and replication machineries towards the origin of LUCA.",Human
"The development of multicellular organisms relies on the precise coordination of molecular events across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Understanding how information flows from molecular interactions to cellular processes and tissue organization during development is crucial for explaining the remarkable reproducibility of complex organisms. This review explores how chromatin-encoded information is transduced from localized transcriptional events to global gene expression patterns, highlighting the challenge of bridging these scales. We discuss recent experimental findings and theoretical frameworks, emphasizing polymer physics as a tool for describing the relationship between chromatin structure and dynamics across scales. By integrating these perspectives, we aim to clarify how gene regulation is coordinated across levels of biological organization and suggest strategies for future experimental approaches.",Human
"In this methods article, we provide a flexible but easy-to-use implementation of Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) based on Boltzmann machine learning, together with a tutorial on how to use it. The package \texttt{adabmDCA 2.0} is available in different programming languages (C++, Julia, Python) usable on different architectures (single-core and multi-core CPU, GPU) using a common front-end interface. In addition to several learning protocols for dense and sparse generative DCA models, it allows to directly address common downstream tasks like residue-residue contact prediction, mutational-effect prediction, scoring of sequence libraries and generation of artificial sequences for sequence design. It is readily applicable to protein and RNA sequence data.",Human
"We present a novel topological framework for analyzing functional brain signals using time-frequency analysis. By integrating persistent homology with time-frequency representations, we capture multi-scale topological features that characterize the dynamic behavior of brain activity. This approach identifies 0D (connected components) and 1D (loops) topological structures in the signal's time-frequency domain, enabling robust extraction of features invariant to noise and temporal misalignments. The proposed method is demonstrated on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, showcasing its ability to discern critical topological patterns and provide insights into functional connectivity. This topological approach opens new avenues for analyzing complex brain signals, offering potential applications in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics.",Human
"A few of the major mass extinctions of paleontology have recently been found to consist of two distinct extinction peaks at higher resolution. A viable explanation for this remains elusive. In this paper it is shown that the recently proposed volcanogenic dark matter model can explain this puzzling characteristic of these extinctions. The accumulation and annihilation of dark matter in the center of the Earth due to the passage of a clump leads to excess heat generation with the consequent ejection of superplumes, followed by massive volcanism and attendant mass extinctions. This is preceded by an extinction pulse due to carcinogenesis arising from the direct interaction of the clumped dark matter with living organisms.",Human
"A large network of integrate-and-fire neurons is studied analytically when the synaptic weights are independently randomly distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with arbitrary mean and variance. The relevant order parameters are identified, and it is shown that such network is statistically equivalent to an ensemble of independent integrate-and-fire neurons with each input signal given by the sum of a self-interaction deterministic term and a Gaussian colored noise. The model is able to reproduce the quasi-synchronous oscillations, and the dropout of their frequency, of the central nervous system neurons of the swimming Xenopus tadpole. Predictions from the model are proposed for future experiments.",Human
"We introduce a segmentation algorithm to probe temporal organization of heterogeneities in human heartbeat interval time series. We find that the lengths of segments with different local values of heart rates follow a power-law distribution. This scale-invariant structure is not a simple consequence of the long-range correlations present in the data. We also find that the differences in mean heart rates between consecutive segments display a common functional form, but with different parameters for healthy individuals and for patients with heart failure. This finding may provide information into the way heart rate variability is reduced in cardiac disease.",Human
"We propose an approach for analyzing signals with long-range correlations by decomposing the signal increment series into magnitude and sign series and analyzing their scaling properties. We show that signals with identical long-range correlations can exhibit different time organization for the magnitude and sign. We find that the magnitude series relates to the nonlinear properties of the original time series, while the sign series relates to the linear properties. We apply our approach to the heartbeat interval series and find that the magnitude series is long-range correlated, while the sign series is anticorrelated and that both magnitude and sign series may have clinical applications.",Human
"We present a new reaction-diffusion model for chiral branching growth of colonies of the bacteria Paenibacillus dendritiformis. In our model the bacteria are represented by a density field with non-linear diffusion and a complex scalar field which represents bacterial orientation. The orientation field introduces anisotropy into the flux of bacteria, representing self-propulsion along their long axes. The model can also reproduce tip-splitting growth of other strains (shorter bacteria) of the same species. The model can capture changes of small number of bacteria, thus it can be used to study the open question of transitions between tip-splitting and chiral dendritic growth.",Human
"As sections of a strand duplexed DNA denature when exposed to high temperature, the excess linking number is taken up by the undenatured portions of the molecule. The mechanical energy that arises because of the overwinding of the undenatured sections can, in principle, alter the nature of the thermal denaturation process. Assuming that the strains associated with this overwinding are not relieved, we find that a simple model of strain-altered melting leads to a suppression of the melting transition when the unaltered transition is continuous. When the melting transition is first order in the absence of strain associated with overwinding, the modification is to a third order phase transition.",Human
"We study the shapes of human red blood cells using continuum mechanics. In particular, we model the crenated, echinocytic shapes and show how they may arise from a competition between the bending energy of the plasma membrane and the stretching/shear elastic energies of the membrane skeleton. In contrast to earlier work, we calculate spicule shapes exactly by solving the equations of continuum mechanics subject to appropriate boundary conditions. A simple scaling analysis of this competition reveals an elastic length which sets the length scale for the spicules and is, thus, related to the number of spicules experimentally observed on the fully developed echinocyte.",Human
"We discuss the relaxation kinetics of a one-dimensional dimer adsorption model as recently proposed for the binding of biological dimers like kinesin on microtubules. The non-equilibrium dynamics shows several regimes: irreversible adsorption on short time scales, an intermediate plateau followed by a power-law regime and finally exponential relaxation towards equilibrium. In all four regimes we give analytical solutions. The algebraic decay and the scaling behaviour can be explained by mapping onto a simple reaction-diffusion model. We show that there are several possibilities to define the autocorrelation function and that they all asymptotically show exponential decay, however with different time constants. Our findings remain valid if there is an attractive interaction between bound dimers.",Human
We discuss a theoretical model for the cooperative binding dynamics of tropomyosin to actin filaments. Tropomyosin binds to actin by occupying seven consecutive monomers. The model includes a strong attraction between attached tropomyosin molecules. We start with an empty lattice and show that the binding goes through several stages. The first stage represents fast initial binding and leaves many small vacancies between blocks of bound molecules. In the second stage the vacancies annihilate slowly as tropomyosin molecules detach and re-attach. Finally the system approaches equilibrium. Using a grain-growth model and a diffusion-coagulation model we give analytical approximations for the vacancy density in all regimes.,Human
"We have carried out Monte Carlo simulation of the fusion of bilayers of single chain amphiphiles which show phase behavior similar to that of biological lipids. The fusion mechanism we observe is very different from the ``stalk'' hypothesis. Stalks do form on the first stage of fusion, but they do not grow radially to form a hemifused state. Instead, stalk formation destabilizes the membranes and results in hole formation in the vicinity of the stalks. When holes in each bilayer nucleate spontaneously next to the same stalk, an incomplete fusion pore is formed. The fusion process is completed by propagation of the initial connection, the stalk, along the edges of the aligned holes.",Human
"We present a theory for the laboratory and epidemiological data for incubation times in infectious prion diseases. The central feature of our model is that slow growth of misfolded protein-aggregates from small initial seeds controls the `latent' or `lag' phase, whereas aggregate-fissioning and subsequent spreading leads to an exponential growth or doubling phase. Such a general framework can account for many features of prion diseases including the striking reproducibility of incubation times when high doses are inoculated into lab animals. Broad incubation time distributions arise for low infectious dose, while our calculated distributions narrow to sharply defined onset times with increased dose. We apply our distributions to epidemiological vCJD data and extract estimates of incubation times.",Human
"We have investigated the effect of particle shape on the eletrorotation (ER) spectrum of living cells suspensions. In particular, we consider coated oblate spheroidal particles and present a theoretical study of ER based on the spectral representation theory. Analytic expressions for the characteristic frequency as well as the dispersion strength can be obtained, thus simplifying the fitting of experimental data on oblate spheroidal cells that abound in the literature. From the theoretical analysis, we find that the cell shape, coating as well as material parameters can change the ER spectrum. We demonstrate good agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental data on human erthrocytes suspensions.",Human
"We examine a simple biologically-motivated neural network, the three-layer version of the Chialvo-Bak `minibrain' [Neurosci. 90 (1999) 1137], and present numerical results which indicate that a non-equilibrium phase transition between ordered and disordered phases occurs subject to the tuning of a control parameter. Scale-free behaviour is observed at the critical point. Notably, the transition here is due solely to network geometry and not any noise factor. The phase of the network is thus a design parameter which can be tuned. The phases are determined by differing levels of interference between active paths in the network and the consequent accidental destruction of good paths.",Human
"We propose a phase coexistence based mechanism for activity of helicases, ubiquitous enzymes that unwind double stranded DNA. The helicase-DNA complex constitutes a fixed-stretch ensemble that entails a coexistence of domains of zipped and unzipped phases of DNA, separated by a domain wall. The motor action of the helicase leads to a change in the position of the fixed constraint thereby shifting the domain wall on dsDNA. We associate this off-equilibrium domain wall motion with the unzipping activity of helicase. We show that this proposal gives a clear and consistent explanation of the main observed features of helicases.",Human
"We construct a gene network based on expression data from DNA microarray experiments, by establishing a link between two genes whenever the Pearson's correlation coefficient between their expression profiles is higher than a certain cutoff. The resulting connectivity distribution is compatible with a power-law decay with exponent ~1, corrected by an exponential cutoff at large connectivity. The biological relevance of such network is demonstrated by showing that there is a strong statistical correlation between high connectivity number and lethality: in close analogy to what happens for protein interaction networks, essential genes are strongly overerpresented among the hubs of the network, that is the genes connected to many other genes.",Human
"Kopitzki et al (preceeding comment) claim that the relationship between Renormalized and Kullback-Leibler entropies has already been given in their previous papers. Moreover, they argue that the first can give more useful information for e.g. localizing the seizure-generating area in epilepsy patients.   In our reply we stress that if the relationship between both entropies would have been known by them, they should have noticed that the condition on the effective temperature is unnecessary. Indeed, this condition led them to choose different reference segments for different channels, even if this was physiologically unplausible. Therefore, we still argue that it is very unlikely that renormalized entropy will give more information than the conventional Kullback-Leibler entropy.",Human
"We propose a model for cell migration where epithelial cells are able to detect trajectories of other cells and try to follow them. As cells move along in 2D cell culture, they mark their paths by loosing tiny parts of cytoplasm. Any cell moving on a surface where other cells have moved before faces a network of cell trajectories, which it tries to restrict its motion onto. With the Tsallis modification of classical thermodynamics one can solve the relevant Fokker-Planck like equation and obtain experimentally testable distribution functions. We compare the model to experimental data of normal mammary epithelial cells and cells which have been genetically manipulated to change their degree of cell-cell interaction.",Human
"We examine a model of biological evolution of Eigen's quasispecies in a holey fitness landscape, where the fitness of a site is either 0 (lethal site) or a uniform positive constant (viable site). So, the evolution dynamics is determined by the topology of the genome space. It is modeled by the random Bethe lattice. We use the effective medium and single-defect approximations to find the criteria, under which the localized quasispecies cloud is created. We find that shorter genomes, which are more robust to random mutations than average, represent a selective advantage which we call ``topological''. A way of assessing empirically the relative importance of reproductive success and topological advantage is suggested.",Human
"We construct a minimalist model of RNA secondary-structure formation and use it to study the mapping from sequence to structure. There are strong, qualitative differences between two-letter and four or six-letter alphabets. With only two kinds of bases, there are many alternate folding configurations, yielding thermodynamically stable ground-states only for a small set of structures of high designability, i.e., total number of associated sequences. In contrast, sequences made from four bases, as found in nature, or six bases have far fewer competing folding configurations, resulting in a much greater average stability of the ground state.",Human
"Diffusion processes in biological membranes are of interest to understand the macromolecular organisation and function of several molecules. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) has been widely used as a method to analyse this processes using classical Brownian diffusion model. In the first part of this work, the analytical expression of the fluorescence recovery as a function of time has been established for anomalous diffusion due to long waiting times. Then, experimental fluorescence recoveries recorded in living cells on a membrane-bound protein have been analysed using three different models : normal Brownian diffusion, Brownian diffusion with an immobile fraction and anomalous diffusion due to long waiting times.",Human
"After summarizing basic features of self-organization such as entropy export, feedbacks and nonlinear dynamics, we discuss several examples in biology. The main part of the paper is devoted to a model of active Brownian motion that allows a stochastic description of the active motion of biological entities based on energy consumption and conversion. This model is applied to the dynamics of swarms with external and interaction potentials. By means of analytical results, we can distiguish between translational, rotational and amoebic modes of swarm motion. We further investigate swarms of active Brownian particles interacting via chemical fields and demonstrate the application of this model to phenomena such as biological aggregation and trail formation in insects.",Human
"Motivated by novel results in the theory of complex adaptive systems, we analyze the dynamics of random walks in which the jumping probabilities are {\it time-dependent}. We determine the survival probability in the presence of an absorbing boundary. For an unbiased walk the survival probability is maximized in the case of large temporal oscillations in the jumping probabilities. On the other hand, a random walker who is drifted towards the absorbing boundary performs best with a constant jumping probability. We use the results to reveal the underlying dynamics responsible for the phenomenon of self-segregation and clustering observed in the evolutionary minority game.",Human
"We study theoretically the in vitro evolution of a DNA sequence by binding to a transcription factor. Using a simple model of protein-DNA binding and available binding constants for the Mnt protein, we perform large-scale, realistic simulations of evolution starting from a single DNA sequence. We identify different parameter regimes characterized by distinct evolutionary behaviors. For each regime we find analytical estimates which agree well with simulation results. For small population sizes, the DNA evolutional path is a random walk on a smooth landscape. While for large population sizes, the evolution dynamics can be well described by a mean-field theory. We also study how the details of the DNA-protein interaction affect the evolution.",Human
"An In Silico model to relate the properties of proteins to the structure, sequence, function and evolutionary history of proteins is shown. The derived ideal sequences for amino acid residues in proteins can then be considered as attractors for structures of actual protein families and their functions. Hopfield networks1 can then act as GCMs (General Content Addressable Memories) when they are trained to recall unique pre-determined states when presented with information associated with that state. The tertiary structure of proteins is determined by structurally enforced interactions between residues and they help to elucidate common motifs exhibited in proteins. The acceptance (or rejection) of substitution on the protein backbone conforms to a nonlinear response and can lead to emergent behavior.",Human
"We present a theory to investigate electro-kinetic behavior, namely, electrorotation and dielectrophoresis under alternating current (AC) applied fields for a pair of touching inhomogeneous colloidal particles and biological cells. These inhomogeneous particles are treated as graded ones with physically motivated model dielectric and conductivity profiles. The mutual polarization interaction between the particles yields a change in their respective dipole moments, and hence in the AC electrokinetic spectra. The multipolar interactions between polarized particles are accurately captured by the multiple images method. In the point-dipole limit, our theory reproduces the known results. We find that the multipolar interactions as well as the spatial fluctuations inside the particles can affect the AC electrokinetic spectra significantly.",Human
"Internal haemorrhage, often leading to cardio-vascular arrest happens to be one of the prime sources of high fatality rates in mammals. We propose a simplistic model of fluid flow to specify the location of the haemorrhagic spots, which, if located accurately, could be operated upon leading to a possible cure. The model we employ for the purpose is inspired by fluid mechanics and consists of a viscous fluid, pumped by a periodic force and flowing through an elastic tube. The analogy is with that of blood, pumped from the heart and flowing through an arte ry or vein. Our results, aided by graphical illustrations, match reasonably well with experimental observations.",Human
"Motivated by novel results in the theory of correlated sequences, we analyze the dynamics of random walks with long-term memory (binary chains with long-range correlations). In our model, the probability for a unit bit in a binary string depends on the fraction of unities preceding it. We show that the system undergoes a dynamical phase-transition from normal diffusion, in which the variance D_L scales as the string's length L, into a super-diffusion phase (D_L ~ L^{1+|alpha|}), when the correlation strength exceeds a critical value. We demonstrate the generality of our results with respect to alternative models, and discuss their applicability to various data, such as coarse-grained DNA sequences, written texts, and financial data.",Human
We study the motion of oil drops propelled by actin polymerization in cell extracts. Drops deform and acquire a pear-like shape under the action of the elastic stresses exerted by the actin comet. We solve this free boundary problem and calculate the drop shape taking into account the elasticity of the actin gel and the variation of the polymerization velocity with normal stress. The pressure balance on the liquid drop imposes a zero propulsive force if gradients in surface tension or internal pressure are not taken into account. Quantitative parameters of actin polymerization are obtained by fitting theory to experiment.,Human
"We investigate by analytical means the stochastic equations of motion of a linear molecular motor model based on the concept of protein friction. Solving the coupled Langevin equations originally proposed by Mogilner et al. (A. Mogilner et al., Phys. Lett. {\bf 237}, 297 (1998)), and averaging over both the two-step internal conformational fluctuations and the thermal noise, we present explicit, analytical expressions for the average motion and the velocity-force relationship. Our results allow for a direct interpretation of details of this motor model which are not readily accessible from numerical solutions. In particular, we find that the model is able to predict physiologically reasonable values for the load-free motor velocity and the motor mobility.",Human
"We propose a statistical mechanics model for DNA melting in which base stacking and pairing are explicitly introduced as distinct degrees of freedom. Unlike previous approaches, this model describes thermal denaturation of DNA secondary structure in the whole experimentally accessible temperature range. Base pairing is described through a zipper model, base stacking through an Ising model. We present experimental data on the unstacking transition, obtained exploiting the observation that at moderately low pH this transition is moved down to experimentally accessible temperatures. These measurements confirm that the Ising model approach is indeed a good description of base stacking. On the other hand, comparison with the experiments points to the limitations of the simple zipper model description of base pairing.",Human
"We propose a nonlinear model derived from first principles, to describe bubble dynamics of DNA. Our model equations include a term derived from the dissipative effect of intermolecular vibrational modes. Such modes are excited by the propagating bubble, and we term it ""curvature dissipation"". The equations we derive allow for stable pinned localized kinks which form the bubble. We perform the stability analysis and specify the energy requirements for the motion of the localized solutions. Our findings are consistent with properties of DNA dynamics, and can be used in models for denaturation bubbles, RNA and DNA transcription, nucleotide excision repair and meiotic recombination.",Human
"The Rugged Metropolis (RM) algorithm is a biased updating scheme, which aims at directly hitting the most likely configurations in a rugged free energy landscape. Details of the one-variable (RM$_1$) implementation of this algorithm are presented. This is followed by an extension to simultaneous updating of two dynamical variables (RM$_2$). In a test with Met-Enkephalin in vacuum RM$_2$ improves conventional Metropolis simulations by a factor of about four. Correlations between three or more dihedral angles appear to prevent larger improvements at low temperatures. We also investigate a multi-hit Metropolis scheme, which spends more CPU time on variables with large autocorrelation times.",Human
"We study the translocation process of a polymer in the absence of external fields for various pore diameters $b$ and membrane thickness $L$. The polymer performs Rouse and reptation dynamics. The mean translocation time $<\tau_t>$ that the polymer needs to escape from a cell, and the mean dwell time $<\tau_d>$ that the polymer spends in the pore during the translocation process, obey scaling relations in terms of the polymer length $N$, $L$ and $b/R_g$, where $R_g$ is the radius of gyration for the polymer. We explain these relations using simple arguments based on polymer dynamics and the equilibrium properties of polymers.",Human
"The Penna bit-string model successfully encompasses many phenomena of population evolution, including inheritance, mutation, evolution and ageing. If we consider social interactions among individuals in the Penna model, the population will form a complex network. In this paper, we first modify the Verhulst factor to control only the birth rate, and introduce activity-based preferential reproduction of offspring in the Penna model. The social interactions among individuals are generated by both inheritance and activity-based preferential increase. Then we study the properties of the complex network generated by the modified Penna model. We find that the resulting complex network has a small-world effect and the assortative mixing property.",Human
"CSAW (conditioned self-avoiding walk) is a model of protein folding that combines SAW (self-avoiding walk) with Monte-Carlo. It simulates the Brownian motion of a chain molecule in the presence of interactions, both among chain residues, and with the environment. In a first model that includes the hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding, a chain of 30 residues folds into a native state with stable secondary and tertiary structures. The process starts with a rapid collapse into an intermediate ""molten globule"", which slowly decays into the native state afer a relatively long quiescent period. The behavior of the radius of gyration mimics experimental data.",Human
We apply Kramers theory to investigate the dissociation of multiple bonds under mechanical force and interpret experimental results for the unfolding/refolding force distributions of an RNA hairpin pulled at different loading rates using laser tweezers. We identify two different kinetic regimes depending on the range of forces explored during the unfolding and refolding process. The present approach extends the range of validity of the two-states approximation by providing a theoretical framework to reconstruct free-energy landscapes and identify force-induced structural changes in molecular transition states using single molecule pulling experiments. The method should be applicable to RNA hairpins with multiple kinetic barriers.,Human
"Dielectrophoresis can potentially be used as an efficient trapping tool in the fabrication of molecular devices. For nanoscale objects, however, the Brownian motion poses a challenge. We show that the use of carbon nanotube electrodes makes it possible to apply relatively low trapping voltages and still achieve high enough field gradients for trapping nanoscale objects, e.g., single molecules. We compare the efficiency and other characteristics of dielectrophoresis between carbon nanotube electrodes and lithographically fabricated metallic electrodes, in the case of trapping nanoscale DNA molecules. The results are analyzed using finite element method simulations and reveal information about the frequency dependent polarizability of DNA.",Human
"Dielectrophoretic trapping of six different DNA fragments, sizes varying from the 27 to 8416 bp, has been studied using confocal microscopy. The effect of the DNA length and the size of the constriction between nanoscale fingertip electrodes on the trapping efficiency have been investigated. Using finite element method simulations in conjunction with the analysis of the experimental data, the polarizabilities of the different size DNA fragments have been calculated for different frequencies. Also the immobilization of trapped hexanethiol- and DTPA-modified 140 nm long DNA to the end of gold nanoelectrodes was experimentally quantified and the observations were supported by density functional theory calculations.",Human
"We study complex networks under random matrix theory (RMT) framework. Using nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor spacing distributions we analyze the eigenvalues of adjacency matrix of various model networks, namely, random, scale-free and small-world networks. These distributions follow Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistic of RMT. To probe long-range correlations in the eigenvalues we study spectral rigidity via $\Delta_3$ statistic of RMT as well. It follows RMT prediction of linear behavior in semi-logarithmic scale with slope being $\sim 1/\pi^2$. Random and scale-free networks follow RMT prediction for very large scale. Small-world network follows it for sufficiently large scale, but much less than the random and scale-free networks.",Human
"We investigate the problem of speciation and coexistence in simple ecosystems when the competition among individuals is included in the Eigen model for quasi-species. By suggesting an analogy between the competition among strains and the diffusion of a chemical inhibitor in a reaction-diffusion system, the speciation phenomenon is considered the analogous of chemical pattern formation in genetic space. In the limit of vanishing mutation rate we obtain analytically the conditions for speciation. Using different forms of the competition interaction we show that the speciation is absent for the genetic equivalent of a normal diffusing inhibitor, and is present for shorter-range interactions. The comparison with numerical simulations is very good.",Human
"A simple analytical framework to study the molecular quasispecies evolution of finite populations is proposed, in which the population is assumed to be a random combination of the constiyuent molecules in each generation,i.e., linkage disequilibrium at the population level is neglected. In particular, for the single-sharp-peak replication landscape we investigate the dependence of the error threshold on the population size and find that the replication accuracy at threshold increases linearly with the reciprocal of the population size for sufficiently large populations. Furthermore, in the deterministic limit our formulation yields the exact steady-state of the quasispecies model, indicating then the population composition is a random combination of the molecules.",Human
"Simple expressions for the bending and the base-stacking energy of double-stranded semiflexible biopolymers (such as DNA and actin) are derived. The distribution of the folding angle between the two strands is obtained by solving a Schr\""{o}dinger equation variationally. Theoretical results based on this model on the extension versus force and extension versus degree of supercoiling relations of DNA chain are in good agreement with the experimental observations of Cluzel {\it et al.} [Science {\bf 271}, 792 (1996)], Smith {\it et al.} [{\it ibid.} {\bf 271}, 795 (1996)], and Strick {\it et al.} [{\it ibid.} {\bf 271}, 1835 (1996)].",Human
The statistical mechanics of heteropolymer structure formation is studied in the context of RNA secondary structures. A designed RNA sequence biased energetically towards a particular native structure (a hairpin) is used to study the transition between the native and molten phase of the RNA as a function of temperature. The transition is driven by a competition between the energy gained from the polymer's overlap with the native structure and the entropic gain of forming random contacts. A simplified Go-like model is proposed and solved exactly. The predicted critical behavior is verified via exact numerical enumeration of a large ensemble of similarly designed sequences.,Human
Biological diversity has evolved despite the essentially infinite complexity of protein sequence space. We present a hierarchical approach to the efficient searching of this space and quantify the evolutionary potential of our approach with Monte Carlo simulations. These simulations demonstrate that non-homologous juxtaposition of encoded structure is the rate-limiting step in the production of new tertiary protein folds. Non-homologous ``swapping'' of low energy secondary structures increased the binding constant of a simulated protein by $\approx10^7$ relative to base substitution alone. Applications of our approach include the generation of new protein folds and modeling the molecular evolution of disease.,Human
"We examine the conformations of a model for a short segment of closed DNA. The molecule is represented as a cylindrically symmetric elastic rod with a constraint corresponding to a specification of the linking number. We obtain analytic expressions leading to the spatial configuration of a family of solutions representing distortions that interpolate between the circular form of DNA and a figure-eight form that represents the onset of interwinding. We are also able to generate knotted loops. We suggest ways to use our approach to produce other configurations relevant to studies of DNA structure. The stability of the distorted configurations is assessed, along with the effects of fluctuations on the free energy of the various configurations.",Human
"A unifying theory of the denaturation transition of DNA, driven by temperature T or induced by an external mechanical torque Gamma is presented. Our model couples the hydrogen-bond opening and the untwisting of the helicoidal molecular structure. We show that denaturation corresponds to a first-order phase transition from B-DNA to d-DNA phases and that the coexistence region is naturally parametrized by the degree of supercoiling sigma. The denaturation free energy, the temperature dependence of the twist angle, the phase diagram in the T,Gamma plane and isotherms in the sigma, Gamma plane are calculated and show a good agreement with experimental data.",Human
I consider a topographic projection between two neuronal layers with different densities of neurons. Given the number of output neurons connected to each input neuron (divergence) and the number of input neurons synapsing on each output neuron (convergence) I determine the widths of axonal and dendritic arbors which minimize the total volume of axons and dendrites. Analytical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional projections can be summarized qualitatively in the following rule: neurons of the sparser layer should have arbors wider than those of the denser layer. This agrees with the anatomical data from retinal and cerebellar neurons whose morphology and connectivity are known. The rule may be used to infer connectivity of neurons from their morphology.,Human
"We present an analytical theory of susceptibility induced nuclear spin dephasing in the capillary network of myocardium. Using a strong collision approach, equations are obtained for the relaxation rate of the free induction and the spin echo decay. Simulation and experimental data are well predicted by the theory. Since paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin as the origin of nuclear spin dephasing has a higher tissue concentration in myocardium supplied by a stenotic, i. e. significantly narrowed, coronary artery, spin dephasing might serve as a diagnostic tool. Our approach can be modified for capillary networks in other tissues than myocardium and may be applied in material science.",Human
"We consider the optimal spacing between marine reserves for maximising the viability of a species occupying a reserve network. The closer the networks are placed together, the higher the probability of colonisation of an empty reserve by an occupied reserve, thus increasing population viability. However, the closer the networks are placed together, the higher the probability that a catastrophe will cause extinction of the species in both reserves, thus decreasing population viability. Using a simple discrete-time Markov chain model for the presence or absence of the species in each reserve we determine the distance between the two reserves which provides the optimal trade-off between these processes, resulting in maximum viability of the species.",Human
"Selection theory requires multiple, distinct, simultaneously-actualized states. In cognition, each thought or cognitive state changes the 'selection pressure' against which the next is evaluated; they are not simultaneously selected amongst. Creative thought is more a matter of honing in a vague idea through redescribing successive iterations of it from different real or imagined perspectives; in other words, actualizing potential through exposure to different contexts. It has been proven that the mathematical description of contextual change of state introduces a non-Kolmogorovian probability distribution, and a classical formalism such as selection theory cannot be used. This paper argues that creative thought evolves not through a Darwinian process, but a process of context-driven actualization of potential.",Human
"The problem of self-tuning a system to the Hopf bifurcation in the presence of noise and periodic external forcing is discussed. We find that the response of the system has a non-monotonic dependence on the noise-strength, and displays an amplified response which is more pronounced for weaker signals. The observed effect is to be distinguished from stochastic resonance. For the feedback we have studied, the unforced self-tuned Hopf oscillator in the presence of fluctuations exhibits sharp peaks in its spectrum. The implications of our general results are briefly discussed in the context of sound detection by the inner ear.",Human
"Aggregated phenomena in social sciences and economics are highly dependent on the way individuals interact. To help understanding the interplay between socio-economic activities and underlying social networks, this paper studies a sequential prisoner's dilemma with binary choice. It proposes an analytical and computational insight about the role of endogenous networks in emergence and sustainability of cooperation and exhibits an alternative to the choice and refusal mechanism that is often proposed to explain cooperation. The study focuses on heterogeneous equilibriums and emergence of cooperation from an all-defector state that are the two stylized facts that this model successfully reconstructs.",Human
"Noise aids the encoding of continuous signals into pulse sequences by way of stochastic resonance and endows the encoding device with a preferred frequency. We study encoding by a threshold device based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, equivalent to the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model. Preferred frequency, optimum noise intensity, and optimum signal-to-noise ratio are shown to be linearly related to the AC amplitude of the input signal. The DC component of the input tunes the device either into transmission (preferred frequency nearly independent of signal amplitude) or selection mode (frequency rising with amplitude). We argue that this behavior may facilitate selective signal processing in neurons.",Human
"A new method to sort gene expression patterns into functional groups is presented. The method is based on a sorting algorithm using a non-local similarity score, which takes all other patterns in the dataset into account. The method is therefore very robust with respect to noise. Using the expression data for yeast, we extract information about functional groups. Without prior knowledge of parameters the cell cycle regulated genes in yeast can be identified. Furthermore a second, independent cell clock is identified. The capability of the algorithm to extract information about signal flow in the regulatory network underlying the expression patterns is demonstrated.",Human
"The folding characteristics of sequences reduced with a possibly simplified representation of five types of residues are shown to be similar to their original ones with the natural set of residues (20 types or 20 letters). The reduced sequences have a good foldability and fold to the same native structure of their optimized original ones. A large ground state gap for the native structure shows the thermodynamic stability of the reduced sequences. The general validity of such a five-letter reduction is further studied via the correlation between the reduced sequences and the original ones. As a comparison, a reduction with two letters is found not to reproduce the native structure of the original sequences due to its homopolymeric features.",Human
"We investigate the relationship between the average fitness decay due to single mutations and the strength of epistatic interactions in genetic sequences. We observe that epistatic interactions between mutations are correlated to the average fitness decay, both in RNA secondary structure prediction as well as in digital organisms replicating in silico. This correlation implies that during adaptation, epistasis and average mutational effect cannot be optimized independently. In experiments with RNA sequences evolving on a neutral network, the selective pressure to decrease the mutational load then leads to a reduction of the amount of sequences with strong antagonistic interactions between deleterious mutations in the population.",Human
The periodic swarming of bacteria is one of the simplest examples for pattern formation produced by the self-organized collective behavior of a large number of organisms. In the spectacular colonies of Proteus mirabilis (the most common species exhibiting this type of growth) a series of concentric rings are developed as the bacteria multiply and swarm following a scenario periodically repeating itself. We have developed a theoretical description for this process in order to get a deeper insight into some of the typical processes governing the phenomena in systems of many interacting living units. All of our theoretical results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the complete set of available observations.,Human
"Given a sequence composed of a limit number of characters, we try to ""read"" it as a ""text"". This involves to segment the sequence into ""words"". The difficulty is to distinguish good segmentation from enormous number of random ones.Aiming at revealing the nonrandomness of the sequence as strongly as possible, by applying maximum likelihood method, we find a quantity called Segmentation Entropy that can be used to fulfill the duty. Contrary to commonplace where maximum entropy principle was applied to obtain good solution, we choose to {\em minimize} the segmentation entropy to obtain good segmentation. The concept developed in this letter can be used to study the noncoding DNA sequences, e.g., for regulatory elements prediction, in eukaryote genomes.",Human
"Finding out statistically significant words in DNA and protein sequences forms the basis for many genetic studies. By applying the maximal entropy principle, we give one systematic way to study the nonrandom occurrence of words in DNA or protein sequences. Through comparison with experimental results, it was shown that patterns of regulatory binding sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast) genomes tend to occur significantly in the promoter regions. We studied two correlated gene family of yeast. The method successfully extracts the binding sites varified by experiments in each family. Many putative regulatory sites in the upstream regions are proposed. The study also suggested that some regulatory sites are a ctive in both directions, while others show directional preference.",Human
In this Communication we present statistical analysis of conservation profiles in families of homologous sequences for nine proteins whose folding nucleus was determined by protein engineering methods. We show that in all but one protein (AcP) folding nucleus residues are significantly more conserved than the rest of the protein. Two aspects of our study are especially important: 1) grouping of amino acids into classes according to their physical-chemical properties and 2) proper normalization of amino acid probabilities that reflects the fact that evolutionary pressure to conserve some amino acid types may itself affect concentration of various amino acid types in protein families. Neglect of any of those two factors may make physical and biological ``signals'' from conservation profiles disappear.,Human
"We study the evolution of large but finite asexual populations evolving in fitness landscapes in which all mutations are either neutral or strongly deleterious. We demonstrate that despite the absence of higher fitness genotypes, adaptation takes place as regions with more advantageous distributions of neutral genotypes are discovered. Since these discoveries are typically rare events, the population dynamics can be subdivided into separate epochs, with rapid transitions between them. Within one epoch, the average fitness in the population is approximately constant. The transitions between epochs, however, are generally accompanied by a significant increase in the average fitness. We verify our theoretical considerations with two analytically tractable bitstring models.",Human
"The presence of low dimensional chaos in the protein secondary structures, using the binary coded $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheet motifs, has been investigated. In order to analyse symbolic DNA/RNA sequences the assignment, based on the purine/pyrimidine and strong/wea k H - bond classification sheme, of binary numbers to the nucleotides was made. We have found that this assignment leads to different averaged fractal dimensions for $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets. When embedded in the two dimensional phase space the binary string structures show the attractor type behavior which depends on the value of the time lag parameter.",Human
"We formulate a kinetic model of DNA replication that quantitatively describes recent results on DNA replication in the in vitro system of Xenopus laevis prior to the mid-blastula transition. The model describes well a large amount of different data within a simple theoretical framework. This allows one, for the first time, to determine the parameters governing the DNA replication program in a eukaryote on a genome-wide basis. In particular, we have determined the frequency of origin activation in time and space during the cell cycle. Although we focus on a specific stage of development, this model can easily be adapted to describe replication in many other organisms, including budding yeast.",Human
"One of the most popular tools for large scale gene expression studies are high-density oligonucleotide (GeneChip(R)) arrays. These currently have 16-20 small probe cells (``features'') for evaluating the transcript abundance of each gene. In addition, each probe is accompanied by a mismatched probe designed as a control for non-specificity. An algorithm is presented to compute comparative expression levels from the intensities of the individual features, based on a statistical study of their distribution. Interestingly, MM probes need not be included in the analysis. We show that our algorithm improves significantly upon the current standard and leads to a substantially larger number of genes brought above the noise floor for further analysis.",Human
"We investigate the competition between two quasispecies residing on two disparate neutral networks. Under the assumption that the two neutral networks have different topologies and fitness levels, it is the mutation rate that determines which quasispecies will eventually be driven to extinction. For small mutation rates, we find that the quasispecies residing on the neutral network with the lower replication rate will disappear. For higher mutation rates, however, the faster replicating sequences may be outcompeted by the slower replicating ones in case the connection density on the second neutral network is sufficiently high. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with flow-reactor simulations of replicating RNA sequences.",Human
"An amino acid sequence of a protein may be decomposed into consecutive overlapping strings of length K. How unique is the converse, i.e., reconstruction of amino acid sequences using the set of K-strings obtained in the decomposition? This problem may be transformed into the problem of counting the number of Eulerian loops in an Euler graph, though the well-known formula must be modified. By exhaustive enumeration and by using the modified formula we show that the reconstruction is unique at K equal or greater than 5 for an overwhelming majority of the proteins in the PDB.seq database. The corresponding Euler graphs provide a means to study the structure of repeated segments in protein sequences.",Human
"Theoretical analysis proves that human survivability is dominated by an unusual physical, rather than biological, mechanism, which yields an exact law. The law agrees with all experimental data, but, contrary to existing theories, it is the same for an entire species, i.e., it is independent of the population, its phenotypes, environment and history. The law implies that the survivability changes with environment via phase transitions, which are simultaneous for all generations. They allow for a rapid (within few percent of the life span) and significant increase in the life expectancy even above its value at a much earlier age.",Human
"We propose a solution on the stopping criterion in segmenting inhomogeneous DNA sequences with complex statistical patterns. This new stopping criterion is based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) in the model selection framework. When this stopping criterion is applied to a left telomere sequence of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the complete genome sequence of bacterium Escherichia coli, borders of biologically meaningful units were identified (e.g. subtelomeric units, replication origin, and replication terminus), and a more reasonable number of domains was obtained. We also introduce a measure called segmentation strength which can be used to control the delineation of large domains. The relationship between the average domain size and the threshold of segmentation strength is determined for several genome sequences.",Human
"Previous divide-and-conquer segmentation analyses of DNA sequences do not provide a satisfactory stopping criterion for the recursion. This paper proposes that segmentation be considered as a model selection process. Using the tools in model selection, a limit for the stopping criterion on the relaxed end can be determined. The Bayesian information criterion, in particular, provides a much more stringent stopping criterion than what is currently used. Such a stringent criterion can be used to delineate larger DNA domains. A relationship between the stopping criterion and the average domain size is empirically determined, which may aid in the determination of isochore borders.",Human
"A comprehensive, semi-quantitative model for the thermodynamics of hydrophobic solvation is presented. The model is based on a very simple premise suggested by the scaled particle theory and treats both solute and solvent molecules as hard spheres. A connection between the peculiarly large heat-capacity change for hydrophobic solvation and the large temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of water is found. Analysis reveals a possible physical origin for the converging behavior of solvation entropies for a series of homologous hydrophobic compounds. The model suggests that the low solubility and the large heat-capacity change of hydrophobic solvation stem from two distinct aspects of water molecules: the static geometry of the molecule and the dynamic hydrogen bonding network, respectively.",Human
"Active phenomena which involve force generation and motion play a key role in a number of phenomena in living cells such as cell motility, muscle contraction and the active transport of material and organelles. Here we discuss mechanical oscillations generated by active systems in cells. Examples are oscillatory regimes in muscles, the periodic beating of axonemal cilia and flagella and spontaneous oscillations of auditory hair cells which play a role in active amplification of weak sounds in hearing. As a prototype system for oscillation generation by proteins, we discuss a general mechanism by which many coupled active elements such as motor molecules can generate oscillations.",Human
"A calculational framework is proposed for phylogenetics, using nonlocal quantum field theories in hypercubic geometry. Quadratic terms in the Hamiltonian give the underlying Markov dynamics, while higher degree terms represent branching events. The spatial dimension L is the number of leaves of the evolutionary tree under consideration. Momentum conservation modulo ${\mathbb Z}_{2}^{times L}$ in $L \leftarrow 1$ scattering corresponds to tree edge labelling using binary L-vectors. The bilocal quadratic term allows for momentum-dependent rate constants - only the tree(s) compatible with selected nonzero edge rates contribute to the branching probability distribution. Applications to models of evolutionary branching processes are discussed.",Human
"Using periodic boundary conditions and a constant applied field, we have simulated current flow through an 8.125 Angstrom internal diameter, rigid, atomistic channel with polar walls in a rigid membrane using explicit ions and SPC/E water. Channel and bath currents were computed from ten 10-ns trajectories for each of 10 different conditions of concentration and applied voltage. An electric field was applied uniformly throughout the system to all mobile atoms. On average, the resultant net electric field falls primarily across the membrane channel, as expected for two conductive baths separated by a membrane capacitance. The channel is rarely occupied by more than one ion. Current-voltage relations are concentration-dependent and superlinear at high concentrations.",Human
The possibility to use sucrose solutions as medium for X-ray and neutron small-angle scattering experiments has been explored for dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles and mixed DMPC/C_(12)E_(8) aggregates. The influence of sucrose concentration on phospholipid vesicles size and polydispersity has been investigated by complimentary X-ray and neutron scattering. Sucrose solutions decreased vesicle size and polydispersity and increased a contrast between phospholipid membrane and bulk solvent sufficiently for X-rays. 40% sucrose in H2O increased X-ray contrast by up to 10 times compared to pure H2O. The range of sucrose concentration 30%-40% created the best experimental conditions for the X-ray small-angle experiment with phospholipid vesicles.,Human
"The small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, time resolved X-ray small-angle and wide-angle diffraction coupled with differential scanning calorimetry have been applied to the investigation of unilamellar and multilamellar dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles in sucrose buffers with sucrose concentrations from 0 to 60%. Sucrose buffer decreased vesicle size and polydispersity and increased an X-ray contrast between phospholipid membrane and bulk solvent sufficiently. No influence of sucrose on the membrane thickness or mutual packing of hydrocarbon chains has been detected. The region of sucrose concentrations 30%-40% created the best experimental conditions for X-ray small-angle experiments with phospholipid vesicles.",Human
"The fluctuation properties of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) time series are studied using detrended fluctuation analysis. For all 128 channels in each of 18 subjects studied, it is found that the standard deviation of the fluctuations exhibits scaling behaviors in two regions. Topographical plots of the scaling exponents reveal the spatial structure of the nonlinear electrical activities recorded on the scalp. Moment analyses are performed to extract the gross features of all the scaling exponents. The correlation between the two scaling exponents in each channel is also examined. It is found that two indices can characterize the overall properties of the fluctuation behaviors of the brain dynamics for every subject and that they vary widely across the subjects.",Human
"We present initial results regarding the existence, stability and interaction of linear and nonlinear vibrational modes in a system of two coupled, one dimensional lattices with unequal numbers of masses. The effects on these nonlinear modes of coupling a near continuum system to a discrete system using a nonlinear coupling are examined. This numerical model is a first step towards investigating the dynamical behavior of a flexible sheet coupled nonlinearly to a semi-rigid support, a system which could conceivably represent a biological cell membrane with a supporting protein network. General implications for the dynamical behavior of continuum systems coupled nonlinearly to discrete systems are introduced.",Human
We discuss two new approaches to extract relevant biological information on the Transcription Factors (and in particular to identify their binding sequences) from the statistical distribution of oligonucleotides in the upstream region of the genes. Both the methods are based on the notion of a ``regulatory network'' responsible for the various expression patterns of the genes. In particular we concentrate on families of coregulated genes and look for the simultaneous presence in the upstream regions of these genes of the same set of transcription factor binding sites. We discuss two instances which well exemplify the features of the two methods: the coregulation of glycolysis in Drosophila melanogaster and the diauxic shift in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,Human
A novel THz near-field spectrometer is presented which allows to perform biological and medical studies with high spectral resolution combined with a spatial resolution down to l/100. In the setup an aperture much smaller than the used wavelength is placed in the beam very close to the sample. The sample is probed by the evanescent wave behind the aperture. The distance is measured extremely accurate by a confocal microscope. We use monochromatic sources which provide powerful coherent cw radiation tuneable from 50 GHz up to 1.5 THz. Transmission and reflection experiments can be performed which enable us to study solids and molecules in aqueous solution. Examples for spectroscopic investigations on biological tissues are presented.,Human
"Graph Theoretic Process Network Synthesis is described as an introduction to biological networks. Genetic, protein and metabolic systems are considered. The theoretical work of Kauffman is discussed and amplified by critical property excursions. The scaling apparent in biological systems is shown. Applications to evolution and reverse engineering are construed. The use of several programs, such as the Synprops, Design of molecules, Therm and Knapsack are suggested as instruments to study biological process network synthesis. The properties of robust self-assembly and Self-Organizing synthesis are important contributors to the discussion. The bar code of life and intelligent design is reviewed. The need for better data in biological systems is emphasized.",Human
"Single molecule DNA experiments often generate data from force versus extension measurements involving the tethering of a microsphere to one end of a single DNA molecule while the other is attached to a substrate. We show that the persistence length of single DNA molecules can also be measured based on the recoil dynamics of these DNA-microsphere complexes if appropriate corrections are made to the friction coefficient of the microsphere in the vicinity of the substrate. Comparison between computer simulated recoil curves, generated from the corresponding Langevin equation, and experimental recoils is used to assure the validity of data analysis.",Human
"Due to its polyionic character the DNA double helix is stable and biologically active only in salty aqueous media where its charge is compensated by solvent counterions. Monovalent metal ions are ubiquitous in DNA environment and they are usually considered as the possible driving force of sequence-dependent modulations of DNA structure that make it recognizable by proteins. In an effort to directly examine this hypothesis, MD simulations of DNA in a water drop surrounded by vacuum were carried out, which relieves the requirement of charge neutrality. Surprisingly, with zero concentration of counterions a dodecamer DNA duplex appears metastable and its structure remains similar to that observed in experiments.",Human
Textual analysis of typical microbial genomes reveals that they have the statistical characteristics of a DNA sequence of a much shorter length. This peculiar property supports an evolutionary model in which a genome evolves by random mutation but primarily grows by random segmental self-copying. That genomes grew mostly by self-copying is consistent with the observation that repeat sequences in all genomes are widespread and intragenomic and intergenomic homologous genes are preponderance across all life forms. The model predicates the coexistence of the two competing modes of evolution: the gradual changes of classical Darwinism and the stochastic spurts envisioned in ``punctuated equilibrium''.,Human
"Electroporation of biological cell membranes is a phenomena that occurs almost universally at a transmembrane potential of approximately 1000 mV. Theories of pore formation have been proposed based on electrocompression (Crowley 1972, Malderelli and Steebe 1992), local membrane defects (Abidor and Chizdhmazdev 1979, Weaver and Mintzer 1981, Sugar 1981), and Statistical models were proposed by (Sowers and Lieber 1986). However, these theories do not in general derive the form of the electric field within the pore. In this paper, we present a view that is useful in describing the biological membrane. We also derive an approximate functional form for the electric field in the region of a pore formed in the membrane.",Human
"Understanding how growth induces form is a longstanding biological question. Many studies concentrated on the shapes of plant cells, fungi or bacteria. Some others have shown the importance of the mechanical properties of bacterial walls and plant tissues in pattern formation. Here I sketch a simple physical picture of cell growth. The study is focussed on isolated cells that have walls. They are modeled as thin elastic shells containing a liquid, which pressure drives the growth as generally admitted for bacteria or plant cells. Requiring mechanical equilibrium leads to estimations of typical cell sizes, in quantitative agreement with compiled data including bacteria, cochlear outer hair, fungi, yeast, root hair and giant alga cells.",Human
"The random map model is a deterministic dynamical system in a finite phase space with n points. The map that establishes the dynamics of the system is constructed by randomly choosing, for every point, another one as being its image. We derive here explicit formulas for the statistical distribution of the number of attractors in the system. As in related results, the number of operations involved by our formulas increases exponentially with n; therefore, they are not directly applicable to study the behavior of systems where n is large. However, our formulas lend themselves to derive useful asymptotic expressions, as we show.",Human
"This paper considers the problem of matching fragment to organism using its complete genome. Our method is based on the probability measure representation of a genome. We first demonstrate that these probability measures can be modelled as recurrent iterated function systems (RIFS) consisting of four contractive similarities. Our hypothesis is that the multifractal characteristic of the probability measure of a complete genome, as captured by the RIFS, is preserved in its reasonably long fragments. We compute the RIFS of fragments of various lengths and random starting points, and compare with that of the original sequence for recognition using the Euclidean distance. A demonstration on five randomly selected organisms supports the above hypothesis.",Human
"In this work we introduce a new approach to Dynamical Monte Carlo methods to simulate markovian processes. We apply this approach to formulate and study an epidemic generalized SIRS model. The results are in excellent agreement with the fourth order Runge-Kutta method in a region of deterministic solution. Introducing local stochastic interactions, the Runge-Kutta method is no longer applicable. Thus, we solve the system described by a set of stochastic differential equations by a Dynamical Monte Carlo technique and check the solutions self-consistently with a stochastic version of the Euler method. We also analyzed the results under the herd-immunity concept.",Human
"This chapter describes gene expression analysis by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), emphasizing initial characterization of the data. We describe SVD methods for visualization of gene expression data, representation of the data using a smaller number of variables, and detection of patterns in noisy gene expression data. In addition, we describe the precise relation between SVD analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) when PCA is calculated using the covariance matrix, enabling our descriptions to apply equally well to either method. Our aim is to provide definitions, interpretations, examples, and references that will serve as resources for understanding and extending the application of SVD and PCA to gene expression analysis.",Human
We discuss the origin of two classes of germinal centers that have been observed during humoral immune responses: Some germinal centers develop very well and give rise to a large number of high affinity antibody producing plasma cells. Other germinal center reaction are very weak and the output production is practically absent. We propose an explanation for this nearly all-or-none behavior of germinal center reactions: The affinity of the seeder B-cells to the antigen is the critical parameter that determines the fate of the germinal center reaction. This hypothesis is verified in the framework of a space-time simulation of germinal center reactions.,Human
"We discuss the ``soft-ratcheting'' algorithm which generates targeted stochastic trajectories in molecular systems with scores corresponding to their probabilities. The procedure, which requires no initial pathway guess, is capable of rapidly determining multiple pathways between known states. Monotonic progress toward the target state is not required. The soft-ratcheting algorithm is applied to an all-atom model of alanine dipeptide, whose unbiased trajectories are assumed to follow overdamped Langevin dynamics. All possible pathways on the two-dimensional dihedral surface are determined. The associated probability scores, though not optimally distributed at present, may provide a mechanism for estimating reaction rates.",Human
"Using data from gene expression databases on various organisms and tissues, including yeast, nematodes, human normal and cancer tissues, and embryonic stem cells, we found that the abundances of expressed genes exhibit a power-law distribution with an exponent close to -1, i.e., they obey Zipf's law. Furthermore, by simulations of a simple model with an intra-cellular reaction network, we found that Zipf's law of chemical abundance is a universal feature of cells where such a network optimizes the efficiency and faithfulness of self-reproduction. These findings provide novel insights into the nature of the organization of reaction dynamics in living cells.",Human
"1H RAMPS solid state NMR and 13C CP/MAS spectra of D- and L- alanine crystals were measured at temperature ranging from 220K to 295K. Some major points are as follows: (1)alpha-H and protons in the methyl group showed a spin-spin coupling effect as temperature went down in the 1H- MAS spectra of D-alanine. (2) In the 1H CRAMPS spectra, peak widths of alpha-H and beta-H showed a different trend between alanine enantiomers when temperature varied.(3) The dynamic behavior of 13C spectra showed an obvious change around 250K, which was supposed as a phase transition in alanine crystal. In the discussion section, we give these experimental phenomena a possible explanation related to chirality.",Human
"The primitive data for deducing the Miyazawa-Jernigan contact energy or BLOSUM score matrix consists of pair frequency counts. Each amino acid corresponds to a conditional probability distribution. Based on the deviation of such conditional probability from random background, a scheme for reduction of amino acid alphabet is proposed. It is observed that evident discrepancy exists between reduced alphabets obtained from raw data of the Miyazawa-Jernigan's and BLOSUM's residue pair counts. Taking homologous sequence database SCOP40 as a test set, we detect homology with the obtained coarse-grained substitution matrices. It is verified that the reduced alphabets obtained well preserve information contained in the original 20-letter alphabet.",Human
"The GOR program for predicting protein secondary structure is extended to include triple correlation. A score system for a residue pair to be at certain conformation state is derived from the conditional weight matrix describing amino acid frequencies at each position of a window flanking the pair under the condition for the pair to be at the fixed state. A program using this score system to predict protein secondary structure is established. After training the model with a learning set created from PDB\_SELECT, the program is tested with two test sets. As a method using single sequence for predicting secondary structures, the approach achieves a high accuracy near 70%.",Human
"Many crucial biological processes operate with surprisingly small numbers of molecules, and there is renewed interest in analyzing the impact of noise associated with these small numbers. Twenty--five years ago, Berg and Purcell showed that bacterial chemotaxis, where a single celled organism must respond to small changes in concentration of chemicals outside the cell, is limited directly by molecule counting noise, and that aspects of the bacteria's behavioral and computational strategies must be chosen to minimize the effects of this noise. Here we revisit and generalize their arguments to estimate the physical limits to signaling processes within the cell, and argue that recent experiments are consistent with performance approaching these limits.",Human
We study the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAfv) in humans using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). Scaling properties of time series of the axial flow velocity averaged over a cardiac beat interval may be characterized by two exponents. The short time scaling exponent (STSE) determines the statistical properties of fluctuations of blood flow velocities in short-time intervals while the Hurst exponent describes the long-term fractal properties. In many migraineurs the value of the STSE is significantly reduced and may approach that of the Hurst exponent. This change in dynamical properties reflects the significant loss of short-term adaptability and the overall hyperexcitability of the underlying cerebral blood flow control system. We call this effect fractal rigidity.,Human
"What determines the caliber of axonal branches? We pursue the hypothesis that the axonal caliber has evolved to minimize signal propagation delays, while keeping arbor volume to a minimum. We show that for a general cost function the optimal diameters of mother ($d_0$) and daughter ($d_1$, $d_2$) branches at a bifurcation obey a branching law: $d_{0}^{\nu+2}=d_{1}^{\nu+2} + d_{2}^{\nu+2}$. The derivation relies on the fact that the conduction speed scales with the axon diameter to the power $\nu$ ($\nu=1$ for myelinated axons and $\nu=0.5$ for non-myelinated axons). We test the branching law on the available experimental data and find a reasonable agreement.",Human
"We study the equilibrium behaviour of a deterministic four-state mutation-selection model as a model for the evolution of a population of nucleotide sequences in sequence space. The mutation model is the Kimura 3ST mutation scheme, and the selection scheme is assumed to be invariant under permutation of sites. Considering the evolution process both forward and backward in time, we use the ancestral distribution as the stationary state of the backward process to derive an expression for the mutational loss (as the difference between ancestral and population mean fitness), and we prove a maximum principle that determines the population mean fitness in mutation-selection balance.",Human
"We investigate a map-based model of paced cardiac muscle in the presence of closed-loop feedback control. The model relates the duration of an action potential to the preceding diastolic interval as well as the preceding action potential duration and thus has some amount of `memory.' We find that the domain of control depends on this memory, independently of the specific functional form of the map. The memory-dependent domain of control can encompass large feedback gains, thus providing the first possible explanation of the recent experimental results of Hall et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett, 88, 198102 (2002)] on controlling alternans in small pieces of rapidly-paced cardiac muscle.",Human
"Several technological applications require the translation of a protein into a nucleic acid that codes for it (``backtranslation''). The degeneracy of the genetic code makes this translation ambiguous; moreover, not every translation is equally viable. The common answer to this problem is the imitation of the codon usage of the target species. Here we discuss several other features of coding sequences (``coding statistics'') that are relevant for the ``genomic style'' of different species. A genetic algorithm is then used to obtain backtranslations that mimic these styles, by minimizing the difference in the coding statistics. Possible improvements and applications are discussed.",Human
"N2 association to the FeMo-cofactor of nitrogenase, including the recently identified central N ligand, has been investigated using first-principles electronic structure calculations. The oxidation state of the resting state of the cofactor and its electronic structure has been identified. A single proton is added to the sulfur bridges following each electron transfer to the cofactor. During N2 association, the cofactor undergoes large rearrangements resulting in opening the central Fe-cage of the cofactor. N2 binds axially while the bond of the bridging SH group breaks. It is then able to insert between the two Fe sites in a bridged configuration.",Human
"We report Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of a generic hydrophobic nanopore connecting two reservoirs which are initially at different Na+ concentrations, as in a biological cell. The nanopore is impermeable to water under equilibrium conditions, but the strong electric field caused by the ionic concentration gradient drives water molecules in. The density and structure of water in the pore are highly field dependent. In a typical simulation run, we observe a succession of cation passages through the pore, characterized by approximately bulk mobility. These ion passages reduce the electric field, until the pore empties of water and closes to further ion transport, thus providing a possible mechanism for biological ion channel gating.",Human
"We present a detailed study of the transport and the efficiency of a ratchet system in a periodic potential in the presence of correlated noises.   The current and the efficiency of the system are investigated. It is found that, when the potential is spatially symmetric, the correlation between the two noises can induce a net transport. The efficiency shows many interesting features as a function of the applied force, the noise intensity, the external load, etc. The efficiency can be maximized as a function of noise intensity (or temperature), which shows that the thermal fluctuation can facilitate the efficiency of energy transformation.",Human
"With the number of sequenced genomes now over one hundred, and the availability of rough functional annotations for a substantial proportion of their genes, it has become possible to study the statistics of gene content across genomes. Here I show that, for many high-level functional categories, the number of genes in the category scales as a power-law in the total number of genes in the genome. The occurrence of such scaling laws can be explained with a simple theoretical model, and this model suggests that the exponents of the observed scaling laws correspond to universal constants of the evolutionary process. I discuss some consequences of these scaling laws for our understanding of organism design.",Human
"The SIRM (Stochastic Inclined Rods Model) proposed by H. Matsuura and M. Nakano can explain the muscle's motion perfectly, but the intermolecular potential between myosin head and G-actin is too simple and only repulsive potential is considered. In this paper we study the SIRM with different complex potential and discuss the effect of the spring on the system. The calculation results show that the spring, the effective radius of the G-actin and the intermolecular potential play key roles in the motion. The sliding speed is about $4.7\times10^{-6}m/s$ calculated from the model which well agrees with the experimental data.",Human
"Learning and memory may rely on the ability of neuronal circuits to reorganize by dendritic spine remodeling. We have looked for geometrical parameters of cortical circuits, which maximize information storage capacity associated with this mechanism. In particular, we calculated optimal volume fractions of various neuropil components. The optimal axonal and dendritic volume fractions are not significantly different from anatomical measurements in the mouse and rat neocortex, and the rat hippocampus. This has led us to propose that the maximization of information storage capacity associated with dendritic spine remodeling may have been an important driving force in the evolution of the cortex.",Human
"Most organisms grow according to simple laws, which in principle can be derived from energy conservation and scaling arguments, critically dependent on the relation between the metabolic rate B of energy flow and the organism mass m. Although this relation is generally recognized to be of the form B(m) = mp, the specific value of the exponent p is the object of an ongoing debate, with many mechanisms being postulated to support different predictions. We propose that multicellular tumor spheroids provide an ideal experimental model system for testing these allometric growth theories, especially under controlled conditions of malnourishment and applied mechanical stress.",Human
"We investigate if known extrinsic and intrinsic factors fully account for the complex features observed in recordings of human activity as measured from forearm motion in subjects undergoing their regular daily routine. We demonstrate that the apparently random forearm motion possesses previously unrecognized dynamic patterns characterized by fractal and nonlinear dynamics. These patterns are unaffected by changes in the average activity level, and persist when the same subjects undergo time-isolation laboratory experiments designed to account for the circadian phase and to control the known extrinsic factors. We attribute these patterns to a novel intrinsic multi-scale dynamic regulation of human activity.",Human
"Light-ion microbeams provide a unique opportunity to irradiate biological samples at the cellular level and to investigate radiobiological effects at low doses of high LET ionising radiation. Since 1998 a single-ion irradiation facility has been developed on the focused horizontal microbeam line of the CENBG 3.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator. This setup delivers in air single protons and alpha particles of a few MeV onto cultured cells, with a spatial resolution of a few microns, allowing subcellular targeting. In this paper, we present results from the use of the GEANT4 toolkit to simulate cellular irradiation with the CENBG microbeam line, from the entrance to the microprobe up to the cellular medium.",Human
"We investigate numerically and on the scaling level the adsorption of a charged colloid on an oppositely charged flexible membrane. We show that the long ranged character of the electrostatic interaction leads to a wrapping reentrance of the complex as the salt concentration is varied. The membrane wrapping depends on the size of the colloid and on the salt concentration and only for intermediate salt concentration and colloid sizes we find full wrapping. From the scaling model we derive simple relations for the phase boundaries between the different states of the complex, which agree well with the numerical minimization of the free energy.",Human
"DNA migration in topologically structured microchannels with periodic cavities is investigated experimentally and with Brownian dynamics simulations of a simple bead-spring model. The results are in very good agreement with one another. In particular, the experimentally observed migration order of Lambda- and T2-DNA molecules is reproduced by the simulations. The simulation data indicate that the mobility may depend on the chain length in a nonmonotonic way at high electric fields. This is found to be the signature of a nonequilibrium phase transition between two different migration states, a slow one and a fast one, which can also be observed experimentally under appropriate conditions.",Human
"An analytical expression has been developed to describe the effects of T2 relaxation and diffusing spatially modulated longitudinal spins during the signal build period of an HOMOGENIZED cross peak. Diffusion of the longitudinal spins results in a lengthening of the effective dipolar demagnetization time, delaying the re-phasing of coupled anti-phase states in the quantum picture. In the classical picture the unwinding rate of spatially twisted magnetization is no longer constant, but decays exponentially with time. The expression is experimentally verified for the HOMOGENIZED spectrum of 100mM TSP in H2O at 4.7T.

"Allometric scaling is one of the most pervasive laws in biology. Its origin, however, is still a matter of dispute. Recent studies have established that maximum metabolic rate scales with an exponent larger than that found for basal metabolism. This unpredicted result sets a challenge that can decide which of the concurrent hypotheses is the correct theory. Here we show that both scaling laws can be deduced from a single network model. Besides the 3/4-law for basal metabolism, the model predicts that maximum metabolic rate scales as $M^{6/7}$, maximum heart rate as $M^{-1/7}$, and muscular capillary density as $M^{-1/7}$, in agreement with data.",Human
"A qualitative model is presented, suggesting gravitational information is transduced into biological systems primarily by its effect on spatially organised membrane and cytoplasmic flows. Continuous low affinity interactions between membrane bound cytoskeletal proteins and phospholipid flows that are undergoing forced convective and shear driven flows are shown to convert this information into spatial protein patterns, and hence cell shape. As applied here to plant cells, the feedback mechanism is shown capable not only of establishing the strict nanometer scale parallelism that exists between proteins running on the inside and outside of the cell membrane, but also to predict its maintainance and the angle of fibre realignment observed during tropic responses.",Human
"The effects of the exposure of the bacterium, Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola to a constant magnetic field with magnetic flux density from a permanent ferrite magnet = 140 mT were studied. Changes in Leptospira cells after their exposure to the field were determined on the basis of changes in their growth behavior and agglutination immunoreactivity with a homologous antiserum using darkfield microscopy together with visual imaging. The data showed that the exposed Leptospira cells have lower densities and lower agglutination immunoreactivity than the unexposed control group. Interestingly, some of the exposed Leptospira cells showed abnormal morphologies such as large lengths. We discussed some of the possible reasons for these observations.",Human
"Spreading of bacteria in a highly advective, disordered environment is examined. Predictions of super-diffusive spreading for a simplified reaction-diffusion equation are tested. Concentration profiles display anomalous growth and super-diffusive spreading. A perturbation analysis yields a crossover time between diffusive and super-diffusive behavior. The time's dependence on the convection velocity and disorder is tested. Like the simplified equation, the full linear reaction-diffusion equation displays super-diffusive spreading perpendicular to the convection. However, for mean positive growth rates the full nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation produces symmetric spreading with a Fisher wavefront, whereas net negative growth rates cause an asymmetry, with a slower wavefront velocity perpendicular to the convection.",Human

We study the statistical mechanics of RNA secondary structures designed to have an attraction between two different types of structures as a model system for heteropolymer aggregation. The competition between the branching entropy of the secondary structure and the energy gained by pairing drives the RNA to undergo a `temperature independent' second order phase transition from a molten to an aggregated phase'. The aggregated phase thus obtained has a macroscopically large number of contacts between different RNAs. The partition function scaling exponent for this phase is \theta ~ 1/2 and the crossover exponent of the phase transition is \nu ~ 5/3. The relevance of these calculations to the aggregation of biological molecules is discussed.,Human
"Complex networks have attracted increasing interests in almost all disciplines of natural and social sciences. However, few efforts have been afforded in the field of chemical engineering. We present in this work an example of complex technological network, investigating the process flow of an ammonia plant (AP). We show that the AP network is a small-world network with scale-free distribution of degrees. Adopting Newman's maximum modularity algorithm for the detection of communities in complex networks, evident modular structures are identified in the AP network, which stem from the modular sections in chemical plants. In addition, we find that the resultant AP tree exhibits excellent allometric scaling.",Human
"The dynamics underlying epileptic seizures are well understood. We present a novel analysis of seizure-like events (SLEs) in an \textit{ex vivo} whole hippocampus, as well as a modeling study that sheds light on the underlying network dynamics. We show that every SLE can be divided into two phases. During the first, SLE dynamics are driven by the intra-network interaction of a network exhibiting high internal synchrony. The second phase is characterized by lead switching, with the leading region exhibiting low internal synchrony. We show that the second phase dynamics are driven by inter-network feedback among multiple regions of the hippocampus.",Human
"We report experimental observations on the effect of disorder on the phase behavior of DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies. Variation in DNA linker lengths results in different melting temperatures of the DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies. We observed an unusual trend of a non-monotonic ``zigzag'' pattern in the melting temperature as a function of DNAlinker length. Linker DNA resulting in unequal DNA duplex lengths introduces disorder and lowers the melting temperature of the nanoparticle system. Comparison with free DNA thermodynamics shows that such an anomalous zigzag pattern does not exist for free DNA duplex melting, which suggests that the disorder introduced by unequal DNA duplex lengths results in this unusual collective behavior of DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies.",Human
"A number of recent works have concentrated on a few statistical properties of complex networks, such as the clustering, the right-skewed degree distribution and the community, which are common to many real world networks. In this paper, we address the hierarchy property sharing among a large amount of networks. Based upon the eigenvector centrality (EC) measure, a method is proposed to reconstruct the hierarchical structure of a complex network. It is tested on the Santa Fe Institute collaboration network, whose structure is well known. We also apply it to a Mathematicians' collaboration network and the protein interaction network of Yeast. The method can detect significantly hierarchical structures in these networks.",Human
"Autonomous oscillations in biological systems may have a biochemical origin or result from an interplay between force-generating and visco-elastic elements. In molecular motor assemblies the force-generating elements are molecular engines and the visco-elastic elements are stiff cytoskeletal polymers. The physical mechanism leading to oscillations depends on the particular architecture of the assembly. Existing models can be grouped into two distinct categories: systems with a delayed force activation and anomalous force-velocity relations. We discuss these systems within phase plane analysis known from the theory of dynamic systems and by adopting methods from control theory, the Nyquist stability criterion.",Human
"We seek to determine the mechanism of like-charge attraction by measuring the temperature dependence of critical divalent counterion concentration ($\rm{C_{c}}$) for the aggregation of fd viruses. We find that an increase in temperature causes $\rm{C_c}$ to decrease, primarily due to a decrease in the dielectric constant ($\epsilon$) of the solvent. At a constant $\epsilon$, $\rm{C_c}$ is found to increase as the temperature increases. The effects of $T$ and $\epsilon$ on $\rm {C_{c}}$ can be combined to that of one parameter: Bjerrum length ($l_{B}$). $\rm{C_{c}}$ decreases exponentially as $l_{B}$ increases, suggesting that entropic effect of counterions plays an important role at the onset of bundle formation.",Human
"By representing damage induction by ionizing particles and its repair by the cell, the probabilistic two-stage model provides a detailed description of the main processes involved in cell killing by radiation. To link this model with issues of interest in hadron radiotherapy, a simple physical model is used. Energy loss, its straggling, and the attenuation of the primary particle fluence are represented in a simplified way, based on semi-phenomenological formulas and energy-loss tables. An effective version of the radiobiological model is joined with the simple physical model to estimate cell survival along ions' penetration depth. The predicted survival ratios for CHO cells irradiated by carbon ions are presented, showing very good agreement with experimental data.",Human
The normal and the inverted pendulum continue to be one of the main physical models and metaphors in science. The inverted pendulum is also a classic study case in control theory. In this paper we consider a special demonstration version of the inverted pendulum which is controlled via a spring. If the spring constant is below a critical level the springy control will be unstable and the pendulum will be kept from falling only by exercising a dynamically varying control. This situation resembles the case of human bipedal quiet standing with the Achilles tendon serving as the spring. The paper is written with physics students in mind.,Human
"Because of growing interest in temperature-based sampling methods like replica exchange, this note aims to make some observations and raise some potentially important questions which we have not seen addressed sufficiently in the literature. Mainly, we wish to call attention to limits on the maximum speed-up to be expected from temperature-based methods, and also note the need for careful quantification of sampling efficiency. Because potentially lengthy studies may be necessary to address these issues, we felt it would be useful to bring them to the attention of the broader community. Here \emph{we are strictly concerned with canonical sampling at a fixed temperature,} and \emph{not} with conformational search.",Human
"The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) has been used for simulating various biological phenomena such as differential adhesion, fruiting body formation of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, angiogenesis, cancer invasion, chondrogenesis in embryonic vertebrate limbs, and many others. In this paper, we derive continuous limit of discrete one dimensional CPM with the chemotactic interactions between cells in the form of a Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of the cell probability density function. This equation is then reduced to the classical macroscopic Keller-Segel model. In particular, all coefficients of the Keller-Segel model are obtained from parameters of the CPM. Theoretical results are verified numerically by comparing Monte Carlo simulations for the CPM with numerics for the Keller-Segel model.",Human
"The simplest mechanism for molecular electron pumps is discussed which is based on nonadiabatic electron tunnelling and nonequilibrium conformational fluctuations. Such fluctuations can be induced, e.g. by random binding of negatively charged ATP molecules to the electron-transferring molecular complex, their subsequent hydrolysis and the products dissociation. The pumping rate can be controlled by the ATP concentration in solution. Depending on the model parameters there may exist a critical ATP concentration for the pump to function. Alternatively, nonequilibrium fluctuations can be induced by externally applied stochastic electric fields. For realistically chosen parameters, the mechanism is shown to be robust and highly efficient.",Human
"Usual formulations of the clustering coefficient can be shown to be insufficient in the task of describing the local topology of very simple networks. Motivated by this, we review some alternatives in order to present an extension, the clustering profile. We show, both conceptually and through applications to well studied networks, that this measure is a more complete and robust measure of clustering. It imposes stringent constraints on theoretical growth models, specially on aspects of the network structure that play a central role in dynamics on networks. In addition, we study how it provides a richer perspective of phenomena such as hierarchy, small-worlds and clusterization.",Human
"Dynamical instrument limitations, such as finite detection bandwidth, do not simply add statistical errors to fluctuation measurements, but can create significant systematic biases that affect the measurement of steady-state properties. Such effects must be considered when calibrating ultra-sensitive force probes by analyzing the observed Brownian fluctuations. In this article, we present a novel method for extracting the true spring constant and diffusion coefficient of a harmonically confined Brownian particle that extends the standard equipartition and power spectrum techniques to account for video-image motion blur. These results are confirmed both numerically with a Brownian dynamics simulation, and experimentally with laser optical tweezers.",Human
"A gaussian distribution of binding energies, but conditioned to exploit generally available information on packing in liquids, provides a statistical-thermodynamic theory of liquid water that is structurally non-committal, molecularly realistic, and surprisingly accurate. Neglect of fluctuation contributions to this gaussian model yields a mean-field theory that produces useless results. A refinement that accounts for sharper-than-gaussian behavior at high binding energies recognizes contributions from a discrete number of water molecules and permits a natural matching of numerically exact results. These gaussian models, which can be understood as vigorous simplifications of quasi-chemical theories, are applicable to aqueous environments where the utility of structural models based on geometrical considerations of water hydrogen bonding have not been established.",Human
"It is known that the action of general anesthetics is proportional to their partition coefficient in lipid membranes (Meyer-Overton rule). This solubility is, however, directly related to the depression of the temperature of the melting transition found close to body temperature in biomembranes. We propose a thermodynamic extension of the Meyer-Overton rule which is based on free energy changes in the system and thus automatically incorporates the effects of melting point depression. This model provides a quantitative explanation of the pressure reversal of anesthesia. Further, it explains why inflammation and the addition of divalent cations reduce the effectiveness of anesthesia.",Human
"Modularity is one of the most prominent properties of real-world complex networks. Here, we address the issue of module identification in two important classes of networks: bipartite networks and directed unipartite networks. Nodes in bipartite networks are divided into two non-overlapping sets, and the links must have one end node from each set. Directed unipartite networks only have one type of nodes, but links have an origin and an end. We show that directed unipartite networks can be conviniently represented as bipartite networks for module identification purposes. We report a novel approach especially suited for module detection in bipartite networks, and define a set of random networks that enable us to validate the new approach.",Human
"Water offers a large temperature domain of stable liquid, and the characteristic hydrophobic effects are first a consequence of the temperature insensitivity of equation-of-state features of the aqueous medium, compared to other liquids. On this basis, the known aqueous media and conditions offer low risk compared to alternatives as a matrix to which familiar molecular biological structures and processes have adapted. The current molecular-scale understanding of hydrophobic hydration is not conformant in detail with a standard structural entropy rationalization. That classic pictorial explanation may serve as a mnemonic, but isn't necessary. A more defensible view is that peculiar hydrophobic effects can be comprehended by examination of engineering parameters characterizing liquid water.",Human
"This paper introduces the use of cable dynamics models as a means to explore the mechanics of DNA on long-length scales. It is on these length scales that DNA forms twisted and curved three-dimensional shapes known as supercoils and loops. These long-length scale DNA structures have a pronounced influence on the functions of this molecule within the cell including the packing of DNA in the cell nucleus, transcription, replication and gene repair. We provide a short background to the mechanics of DNA and suggest the logical connection to the mechanics of a low tension cable. A computational model is then summarized and example results are presented for DNA supercoiling and looping.",Human
"In a recent Letter [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 71, 432 (2002)], we reported a preliminary calculation and concluded that public exposure to mobile phones can be enhanced by microwave reflection in public spaces. In this paper, we confirm the significance of microwave reflection reported in our previous Letter by experimental and numerical studies. Furthermore, we show that ""hot spots"" often emerge in reflective areas, where the local exposure level is much higher than average. Such places include elevators, and we discuss other possible environments including trains, buses, cars, and airplanes. Our results indicate the risk of ""passive exposure"" to microwaves.",Human
"We present a Hamiltonian approach for the wellknown Eigen model of the Darwin selection dynamics. Hamiltonization is carried out by means of the embedding of the population variable space, describing behavior of the system, into the space of doubled dimension by introducing additional dynamic variables. Besides the study of the formalism, we try to interpret its basic elements (phase space, Hamiltonian, geometry of solutions) in terms of the theoretical biology. A geometric treatment is given for the considered system dynamics in terms of the geodesic flows in the Euclidean space where the population variables serve as curvilinear coordinates. The evolution of the distribution function is found for arbitrary distributed initial values of the population variables.",Human
"Theories of solvation free energies often involve electrostatic potentials at the position of a solute charge. Simulation calculations that apply cutoffs and periodic boundary conditions based on molecular centers result in center-dependent contributions to electrostatic energies due to a systematic sorting of charges in radial shells. This sorting of charges induces a surface-charge density at the cutoff sphere or simulation-box boundary that depends on the choice of molecular centers. We identify a simple solution that gives correct, center-independent results, namely the radial integration of charge densities. Our conclusions are illustrated for a Lennard-Jones solute in water. The present results can affect the parameterization of force fields.",Human
"A simple model of biological extinction with variable system size is presented that exhibits a power-law distribution of extinction event sizes. The model is a generalization of a model recently introduced by Newman (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B265, 1605 (1996). Both analytical and numerical analysis show that the exponent of the power-law distribution depends only marginally on the growth rate $g$ at which new species enter the system and is equal to the one of the original model in the limit $g\to\infty$. A critical growth rate $g_c$ can be found below which the system dies out. Under these model assumptions stable ecosystems can only exist if the regrowth of species is sufficiently fast.",Human
"The multicanonical ansatz is used to study variations in the energy landscape of a small peptide, Met-enkephalin, under a change from the ECEPP/2 force field to ECEPP/3. Local minima with energies up to 5 kcal/mol higher than the global minima are sampled and classified according to H-bridges and backbone angles. The distribution and relative weight for various temperatures of the minima are calculated and compared for the two force fields. We demonstrate that while there are small differences in the energy landscape our results at relevant temperatures are robust under changes between ECEPP/2 to ECEPP/3.",Human
"A simple mathematical homogeneous model of competition is used to describe Neanderthal extinction in Europe. It considers two interacting species, Neanderthals and Early Modern Men, in the same ecological niche. Using paleontological data we claim that the parameter of similarity, between both species, fluctuates between 0.992 and 0.997. An extension of the model including migration (diffusion) is also discussed nevertheless, extinction of Neanderthal seems unavoidable. Numerical analysis of travelling wave solution (fronts) comfirms the extinction. The wave-front-velocity is estimated from linear analysis and numerical simulations confirm this estimation. We conjecture a mathematical formulation for the principle of exclusion between competitive interacting species (Gause).",Human
"We demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish with a complete certainty between healthy subjects and patients with various dysfunctions of the cardiac nervous system by way of multiresolutional wavelet transform of RR intervals. We repeated the study of Thurner et al on different ensemble of subjects. We show that reconstructed series using a filter which discards wavelet coefficients related with higher scales enables one to classify individuals for which the method otherwise is inconclusive. We suggest a delimiting diagnostic value of the standard deviation of the filtered, reconstructed RR interval time series in the range of $\sim 0.035$ (for the above mentioned filter), below which individuals are at risk.",Human
"We perform a generalized-ensemble simulation of a small peptide taking the interactions among all atoms into account. From this simulation we obtain thermodynamic quantities over a wide range of temperatures. In particular, we show that the folding of a small peptide is a multi-stage process associated with two characteristic temperatures, the collapse temperature T_{\theta} and the folding temperature T_f. Our results give supporting evidence for the energy landscape picture and funnel concept. These ideas were previously developed in the context of studies of simplified protein models, and here for the first time checked in an all-atom Monte Carlo simulation.",Human
"We develop a formulation for molecular dynamics, Langevin, and hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms in the recently proposed generalized ensemble that is based on a physically motivated realisation of Tsallis weights. The effectiveness of the methods are tested with an energy function for a protein system. Simulations in this generalized ensemble by the three methods are performed for a penta peptide, Met-enkephalin. For each algorithm, it is shown that from only one simulation run one can not only find the global-minimum-energy conformation but also obtain probability distributions in canonical ensemble at any temperature, which allows the calculation of any thermodynamic quantity as a function of temperature.",Human
"We present a so-called adaptive Ising model (AIM) to provide a unifying explanation for sensitivity and perfect adaptation in bacterial chemotactic signalling, based on coupling among receptor dimers. In an AIM, an external field, representing ligand binding, is randomly applied to a fraction of spins, representing the states of the receptor dimers, and there is a delayed negative feedback from the spin value on the local field. This model is solved in an adiabatic approach. If the feedback is slow and weak enough, as indeed in chemotactic signalling, the system evolves through quasi-equilibrium states and the ``magnetization'', representing the signal, always attenuates towards zero and is always sensitive to a subsequent stimulus.",Human
"With the aim of understanding the emergence of collective motion from local interactions of organisms in a ""noisy"" environment, we study biologically inspired, inherently non-equilibrium models consisting of self-propelled particles. In these models particles interact with their neighbors by turning towards the local average direction of motion. In the limit of vanishing velocities this behavior results in a dynamics analogous to some Monte Carlo realization of equilibrium ferromagnets. However, numerical simulations indicate the existence of new types of phase transitions which are not present in the corresponding ferromagnets. In particular, here we demonstrate both numerically and analytically that even in certain one dimensional self-propelled particle systems an ordered phase exists for finite noise levels.",Human
"In this paper we investigate error-thresholds on dynamics fitness-landscapes. We show that there exists both lower and an upper threshold, representing limits to the copying fidelity of simple replicators. The lower bound can be expressed as a correction term to the error-threshold present on a static landscape. The upper error-threshold is a new limit that only exists on dynamic fitness-landscapes. We also show that for long genomes on highly dynamic fitness-landscapes there exists a lower bound on the selection pressure needed to enable effective selection of genomes with superior fitness independent of mutation rates, i.e., there are distinct limits to the evolutionary parameters in dynamic environments.",Human
"The suitability of using the angular peak shape of the coherent backscattered light for estimating the light transport parameters of biological media has been investigated. Milk and methylene blue doped milk were used as tissue phantoms for the measurements carried out with a He-Ne laser (632.8nm). Results indicate that while the technique accurately estimates the transport length, it can determine the absorption coefficient only when the absorption is moderately high ($\alpha > 1 cm^{-1}$) for the long transport lengths typical of tissues. Further, the possibility of determining the anisotropy factor by estimating the single scattering contribution to the diffuse background is examined.",Human
"We review the properties of biological motor proteins which move along linear filaments that are polar and periodic. The physics of the operation of such motors can be described by simple stochastic models which are coupled to a chemical reaction. We analyze the essential features of force and motion generation and discuss the general properties of single motors in the framework of two-state models. Systems which contain large numbers of motors such as muscles and flagella motivate the study of many interacting motors within the framework of simple models. In this case, collective effects can lead to new types of behaviors such as dynamic instabilities of the steady states and oscillatory motion.",Human
"Recently, renormalized entropy was proposed as a novel measure of relative entropy (P. Saparin et al., Chaos, Solitons & Fractals 4, 1907 (1994)) and applied to several physiological time sequences, including EEGs of patients with epilepsy. We show here that this measure is just a modified Kullback-Leibler (K-L) relative entropy, and it gives similar numerical results to the standard K-L entropy. The latter better distinguishes frequency contents of e.g. seizure and background EEGs than renormalized entropy. We thus propose that renormalized entropy might not be as useful as claimed by its proponents. In passing we also make some critical remarks about the implementation of these methods.",Human
"In this paper we treat some fractal and statistical features of the DNA sequences. First, a fractal record model of DNA sequence is proposed by mapping DNA sequences to integer sequences, followed by R/S analysis of the model and computation of the Hurst exponents. Second, we consider transition between the four kinds of bases within DNA. The transition matrix analysis of DNA sequences shows that some measures of complexity based on transition proportion matrix are of interest. We use some measures of complexity to distinguish exon and intron. Regarding the evolution, we find that for species of higher grade, the transition rate among the four kinds of bases goes further from the equilibrium.",Human
"The influence of time-dependent fitnesses on the infinite population dynamics of simple genetic algorithms (without crossover) is analyzed. Based on general arguments, a schematic phase diagram is constructed that allows one to characterize the asymptotic states in dependence on the mutation rate and the time scale of changes. Furthermore, the notion of regular changes is raised for which the population can be shown to converge towards a generalized quasispecies. Based on this, error thresholds and an optimal mutation rate are approximately calculated for a generational genetic algorithm with a moving needle-in-the-haystack landscape. The so found phase diagram is fully consistent with our general considerations.",Human
"In this paper we argue that the pattern of cell movements in the morphogenetic process known as convergent extension can be understood as a energy minimization process, provided the cell-cell adhesive energy has a certain kind of anisotropy. This single simple property is sufficient cause for the type of cell elongation, alignment, and intercalation of a cellular array that is the characteristic of convergent extension. We describe the type of anisotropy required. We show that the final aspect ratio of the array of cells is independent of the initial configuration and of the degree of cell elongation. We find how it depends on the anisotropy.",Human
"This note provides a theorem showing, under suitable technical assumptions, that if a system S adapts to a class of external signals U, in the sense of egulation against disturbances or tracking signals in U, then S must ecessarily contain a subsystem which is capable of generating all the signals in U. It is not assumed that regulation is robust, nor is there a prior requirement for the system to be partitioned into separate plant and controller components. Instead, one assumes that a ``signal detection'' property holds. The result was motivated by questions of adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis, but the general mathematical principle is of wide applicability.",Human
"We study counter expressed gene networks constructed from gene-expression data obtained from many types of cancers. The networks are synthesized by connecting vertices belonging to each others' list of K-farthest-neighbors, with K being an a priori selected non-negative integer. In the range of K corresponding to minimum homogeneity, the degree distribution of the networks shows scaling. Clustering in these networks is smaller than that in equivalent random graphs and remains zero till significantly large K. Their small diameter, however, implies small-world behavior which is corroborated by their eigenspectrum. We discuss implications of these findings in several contexts.",Human
"We examine interacting cognitive modules of human biology which, in the asymptotic limit of long sequences of responses, define the output of an appropriate 'dual' information source. Applying a 'necessary condition' communication theory formalism roughly similar to that of Dretske, but focused entirely on long sequences of signals, we examine the regularities apparent in comorbid psychiatric and chronic physical disorders using an extension of recent perspectives on autoimmune disease. We find that structured psychosocial stress can literally write a distorted image of itself onto child development, resulting in a life course trajectory to characteristic forms of comorbid mind/body dysfunction affecting both dominant and subordinate populations within a pathogenic social hierarchy.",Human
"Many important cellular functions are implemented by protein complexes that act as sophisticated molecular machines of varying size and temporal stability. Here we demonstrate quantitatively that protein complexes in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are comprised of a core in which subunits are highly coexpressed, display the same deletion phenotype (essential or non-essential) and share identical functional classification and cellular localization. This core is surrounded by a functionally mixed group of proteins, which likely represent short-lived- or spurious attachments. The results allow us to define the deletion phenotype and cellular task of most known complexes, and to identify with high confidence the biochemical role of hundreds of proteins with yet unassigned functionality.",Human
"We have performed a statistical analysis of the spatial distribution of operons in the transcriptional regulation network of Escherichia coli. The analysis reveals that operons that regulate each other and operons that are coregulated tend to lie next to each other on the genome. Moreover, these pairs of operons tend to be transcribed in diverging directions. This spatial arrangement of operons allows the upstream regulatory regions to interfere with each other. This affords additional regulatory control, as illustrated by a mean-field analysis of a feed-forward loop. Our results suggest that regulatory control can provide a selection pressure that drives operons together in the course of evolution.",Human
"An analysis of the Kimura 3ST model of DNA sequence evolution is given on the basis of its continuous Lie symmetries. The rate matrix commutes with a U(1)xU(1)xU(1) phase subgroup of the group GL(4) of 4x4x4 invertible complex matrices acting on a linear space spanned by the 4 nucleic acid base letters. The diagonal `branching operator' representing speciation is defined, and shown to intertwine the U(1)xU(1)xU(1) action. Using the intertwining property, a general formula for the probability density on the leaves of a binary tree under the Kimura model is derived, which is shown to be equivalent to established phylogenetic spectral transform methods.",Human
"This paper presents a unified mathematical framework for inference in graphical models, building on the observation that graphical models are algebraic varieties.   From this geometric viewpoint, observations generated from a model are coordinates of a point in the variety, and the sum-product algorithm is an efficient tool for evaluating specific coordinates. The question addressed here is how the solutions to various inference problems depend on the model parameters. The proposed answer is expressed in terms of tropical algebraic geometry. A key role is played by the Newton polytope of a statistical model. Our results are applied to the hidden Markov model and to the general Markov model on a binary tree.",Human
"Biological phenomena differ significantly from physical phenomena. At the heart of this distinction is the fact that biological entities have computational abilities and thus they are inherently difficult to predict. This is the reason why simplified models that provide the minimal requirements for computation turn out to be very useful to study networks of many components. In this chapter, we briefly review the dynamical aspects of models of regulatory networks, discussing their most salient features, and we also show how these models can give clues about the way in which networks may organize their capacity to evolve, by providing simple examples of the implementation of robustness and modularity.",Human
"Examining elevated rates of systemic lupus erythematosus in African-American women from perspectives of immune cognition suggests the disease constitutes an internalized physiological image of external structured psychosocial stress, a 'pathogenic social hierarchy' involving the synergism of racism and gender discrimination in the context of policy-driven social disintegration which has particularly affected ethnic minorities in the USA. The disorder represents the punctuated resetting of normal immune self-image to a self-attacking excited state, a process formally analogous to models of punctuated equilibrium in evolutionary theory. Both onset and progression of disease may be stratified by a relation to cyclic physiological responses which are long in comparison with heartbeat period: circadian, hormonal, and annual light/termperature cycles.",Human
"We present a method for hierarchical clustering of data called {\it mutual information clustering} (MIC) algorithm. It uses mutual information (MI) as a similarity measure and exploits its grouping property: The MI between three objects $X, Y,$ and $Z$ is equal to the sum of the MI between $X$ and $Y$, plus the MI between $Z$ and the combined object $(XY)$. We use this both in the Shannon (probabilistic) version of information theory and in the Kolmogorov (algorithmic) version. We apply our method to the construction of phylogenetic trees from mitochondrial DNA sequences and to the output of independent components analysis (ICA) as illustrated with the ECG of a pregnant woman.",Human
"The effect of small-amplitude noise on excitable systems with large time-scale separation is analyzed. It is found that small random perturbations of the fast excitatory variable result in the onset of a quasi-deterministic limit cycle behavior, absent without noise. The limit cycle is established at a critical value of the amplitude of the noise, and its period is nontrivially determined by the relationship between the noise amplitude and the time scale ratio. It is argued that this effect might provide a mechanism by which the function of biological systems operating in noisy environments can be robustly controlled by the level of the noise.",Human
"We study the steady state of an assembly of microtubules in a confined volume, analogous to the situation inside a cell where the cell boundary forms a natural barrier to growth. We show that the dynamical equations for growing and shrinking microtubules predict the existence of two steady states, with either exponentially decaying or exponentially increasing distribution of microtubule lengths. We identify the regimes in parameter space corresponding to these steady states. In the latter case, the apparent catastrophe frequency near the boundary was found to be significantly larger than that in the interior. Both the exponential distribution of lengths and the increase in the catastrophe frequency near the cell margin is in excellent agreement with recent experimental observations.",Human
"We assume that the natural intelligence (human, particularly) is equivalent to a large inferring structure, which took shape in the last 400/500 million years. Then two hypotheses, about this structure and its development, are put forward for consideration. The first one concerns the transmission, from one generation to another, of the structure: we propose that this passage is done by direct transfer, mother to children, during pregnancy (maternal download). The second hypothesis regards the structure evolution: now the acquired improvements can be transferred to the descendants, so it is possible to envisage a governed evolutionary process (evolution by improvements).",Human
"The rapidly developing theory of complex networks indicates that real networks are not random, but have a highly robust large-scale architecture, governed by strict organizational principles. Here, we focus on the properties of biological networks, discussing their scale-free and hierarchical features. We illustrate the major network characteristics using examples from the metabolic network of the bacterium Escherichia coli. We also discuss the principles of network utilization, acknowledging that the interactions in a real network have unequal strengths. We study the interplay between topology and reaction fluxes provided by flux-balance analysis. We find that the cellular utilization of the metabolic network is both globally and locally highly inhomogeneous, dominated by ""hot-spots"", representing connected high-flux pathways.",Human
"We adapt an information theory analysis of interacting cognitive biological and social modules to the problem of the global neuronal workspace, the current standard neuroscience picture of consciousness. Tunable punctuation emerges in a natural manner, suggesting the possibility of fitting appropriate phase transition power law, and, away from transition, generalized Onsager relation expressions, to observational data on conscious reaction. The development can be extended in a straightforward way to include the role of psychosocial stress, culture, or other embedding structured contexts in individual consciousness, producing a 'biopsychosocial' model that closely retains the flavor of the standard treatment, but better meets philosophical and other objections to brain-only descriptions.",Human
"F1-ATPase catalyses ATP hydrolysis and converts the cellular chemical energy into mechanical rotation. The hydrolysis reaction in F1-ATPase does not follow the widely believed Michaelis-Menten mechanism. Instead, the hydrolysis mechanism behaves in an ATP-dependent manner. We develop a model for enzyme kinetics and hydrolysis cooperativity of F1-ATPase which involves the binding-state changes to the coupling catalytic reactions. The quantitative analysis and modeling suggest the existence of complex cooperative hydrolysis between three different catalysis sites of F1-ATPase. This complexity may be taken into account to resolve the arguments on the bindingchange mechanism in F1-ATPase.",Human
"The stability and conservation properties of a recently proposed polymerization model are studied. The achiral (racemic) solution is linearly unstable once the relevant control parameter (here the fidelity of the catalyst) exceeds a critical value. The growth rate is calculated for different fidelity parameters and cross-inhibition rates. A chirality parameter is defined and shown to be conserved by the nonlinear terms of the model. Finally, a truncated version of the model is used to derive a set of two ordinary differential equations and it is argued that these equations are more realistic than those used in earlier models of that form.",Human
"Viral kinetics have been extensively studied in the past through the use of spatially homogeneous ordinary differential equations describing the time evolution of the diseased state. However, spatial characteristics such as localized populations of dead cells might adversely affect the spread of infection, similar to the manner in which a counter-fire can stop a forest fire from spreading. In order to investigate the influence of spatial heterogeneities on viral spread, a simple 2-D cellular automaton (CA) model of a viral infection has been developed. In this initial phase of the investigation, the CA model is validated against clinical immunological data for uncomplicated influenza A infections. Our results will be shown and discussed.",Human
"Alternative splicing allows an organism to make different proteins in different cells at different times, all from the same gene. In a cell that uses alternative splicing, the total length of all the exons is much shorter than in a cell that encodes the same set of proteins without alternative splicing. This economical use of exons makes genes more stable during reproduction and development because a genome with a shorter exon length is more resistant to harmful mutations. Genomic stability may be the reason why higher vertebrates splice alternatively. For a broad class of alternatively spliced genes, a formula is given for the increase in their stability.",Human
We present a method to quantify spatial fluctuations of the substitution rate on different length scales throughout genomes of eukaryotes. The fluctuations on large length scales are found to be predominantly a consequence of a coarse-graining effect of fluctuations on shorter length scales. This is verified for both the mouse and the human genome. We also found that both species show similar standard deviation of fluctuations even though their mean substitution rate differs by a factor of two. Our method furthermore allows to determine time-resolved substitution rate maps from which we can compute auto-correlation functions in order to quantify how fast the spatial fluctuations in substitution rate change in time.,Human
"By taking into account base-base stacking interactions we improve the Generalized Model of Polypeptide Chain (GMPC). Based on a one-dimensional Potts-like model with many-particle interactions, the GMPC describes the helix-coil transition in both polypeptides and polynucleotides. In the framework of the GMPC we show that correctly introduced nearest-neighbor stacking interactions against the background of hydrogen bonding lead to increased stability (melting temperature) and, unexpectedly, to decreased cooperativity (maximal correlation length). The increase in stability is explained as due to an additional stabilizing interaction (stacking) and the surprising decrease in cooperativity is seen as a result of mixing of contributions of hydrogen bonding and stacking.",Human
"The persistence of life requires populations to adapt at a rate commensurate with the dynamics of their environment. Successful populations that inhabit highly variable environments have evolved mechanisms to increase the likelihood of successful adaptation. We introduce a $64 \times 64$ matrix to quantify base-specific mutation potential, analyzing four different replicative systems, error-prone PCR, mouse antibodies, a nematode, and Drosophila. Mutational tendencies are correlated with the structural evolution of proteins. In systems under strong selective pressure, mutational biases are shown to favor the adaptive search of space, either by base mutation or by recombination. Such adaptability is discussed within the context of the genetic code at the levels of replication and codon usage.",Human
"A previously proved theorem gives sufficient conditions for an estimator of the false discovery rate (FDR) to conservatively converge to the FDR with probability 1 as the number of hypothesis tests increases, even for small sample sizes. It does not follow that several thousand tests ensure that the estimator has moderate variance under those conditions. In fact, they can hold even if the test statistics have long-range correlations, which yield unacceptably wide confidence intervals, as observed in genomic data when there are 8 or 16 individuals (microarrays) per group. Thus, informative FDR estimation will include some measure of its reliability.",Human
"In the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged through several levels of compaction in an orderly retrievable way that enables the correct regulation of gene expression. The functional dynamics of this assembly involves the unwinding of the so-called 30 nm chromatin fiber and accordingly imposes strong topological constraints. We present a general method for computing both the twist and the writhe of any winding pattern. An explicit derivation is implemented for the chromatin fiber which provides the linking number of DNA in eukaryotic chromosomes. We show that there exists one and only one unwinding path which satisfies both topological and mechanical constraints that DNA has to deal with during condensation/decondensation processes.",Human
"This article introduces the physics of information in the context of molecular biology and genomics. Entropy and information, the two central concepts of Shannon's theory of information and communication, are often confused with each other but play transparent roles when applied to statistical ensembles (i.e., identically prepared sets) of symbolic sequences. Such an approach can distinguish between entropy and information in genes, predict the secondary structure of ribozymes, and detect the covariation between residues in folded proteins. We also review applications to molecular sequence and structure analysis, and introduce new tools in the characterization of resistance mutations, and in drug design.",Human
Evolutionary models measure the probability of amino acid substitutions occurring over different evolutionary distances. We examine various evolutionary models based on empirically derived amino acid substitution matrices. The models are constructed using the PAM and BLOSUM amino acid substitution matrices. We rescale these matrices by raising them to powers to model substitution patterns that account for different evolutionary distances. We also examine models that account for the dissimilarity of substitution rates along a protein sequence. We compare the models by computing the likelihood of each model across different alignments. We also present a specific example to illustrate the subtle differences in the estimation of evolutionary distance computed using the different models.,Human
"Recent developments in complex networks have paved the way to a series of important biological insights, such as the fact that many of the essential proteins of S. cerevisae corresponds to the so-called hubs of the respective protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the special importance of hubs, other types of nodes such as those corresponding to the network border, as well as the innermost nodes, also deserve special attention. This work reports on how the application of the concept of distance transform to networks showed that a great deal of the innermost nodes correspond to essential proteins, with interesting biological implications.",Human
"In this Letter, we extend the semiconservative quasispecies equations to incorporate imperfect DNA lesion repair. We study the equilibrium behavior of this model in the limit of infinite sequence length and population size, using a single-fitness-peak landscape for which the master genome can sustain a finite number of lesions and remain viable. We provide a full analytical treatment of the problem, providing a general mathematical framework as well as the full solution for a particular class of fitness landscapes. Stochastic simulations using finite sequence lengths and populations agree well with the analytical results. Applications to biological systems are briefly discussed.",Human
"We describe the representation of the chemical affinity between the antigen-combining site of the immunoglobulin molecule and the antigen molecule as the probability of the two molecules existing in a bound state. Our model is based on the identification of shape attractors in the configuration space for the joint antibody / antigen combining site sequence. We parameterize configuration space in terms of Ramachandran angles. The shape attractors allow us to construct a Markov chain whose steady state distribution gives rise to the desired attachment probability. As a result we are able to delineate the enthalpic, entropic and kinetic components of affinity and study their interactions.",Human
"We give an exposition of Plucker vectors for a system of joint axes in projective 3-space. We use Plucker vectors to analyse dependencies among joint axes, and in particular show that two rotational joints rigidly joined by a bar and each with 3 degrees of freedom always forms a 5-dimensional system. We introduce the concept of reduced redundancy in a dependent set of projective Lines, and argue that reduced redundancy in the axes of a body position increases injury risk. We apply this to a simple two-joint model of bowling in cricket, and show by analysis of some experimental data that reduced redundancy around ball release is observed in some cases.",Human
"We study evolutionary processes induced by spatio-temporal dynamics in prebiotic evolution. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that hypercycles emerge from complex interaction structures in multispecies systems. In this work we also find that `hypercycle hybrid' protects the hypercycle from its environment during the growth process. There is little selective advantage for one hypercycle to maintain coexistence with others. This brings the possibility of the outcompetition between hypercycles resulting in the negative effect on information diversity. To enrich the information in hypercycles, symbiosis with parasites is suggested. It is shown that symbiosis with parasites can play an important role in the prebiotic immunology.",Human
"Reaction-diffusion equations based on a polymerization model are solved to simulate the spreading of hypothetic left and right handed life forms on the Earth's surface. The equations exhibit front-like behavior as is familiar from the theory of the spreading of epidemics. It is shown that the relevant time scale for achieving global homochirality is not, however, the time scale of front propagation, but the much longer global diffusion time. The process can be sped up by turbulence and large scale flows. It is speculated that, if the deep layers of the early ocean were sufficiently quiescent, there may have been the possibility of competing early life forms with opposite handedness.",Human
"The internal cell wall structure of the bacterium Lactobacillus helveticus has been observed in situ in aqueous solution using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The AFM tip was used not only for imaging but presumably to remove mechanically large patches of the outer cell wall after appropriate chemical treatment, which typically leaves the bacteria alive. The surface exposed after such a surgery revealed ca. 26 nm thick twisted strands within the cell wall. The structure and location of the observed strands are consistent with the glycan backbone of peptidoglycan fibers that give strength to the cell wall. The found structural organization of these fibers has not been observed previously.",Human
"Here we study the effects of many-body interactions on rate and mechanism in protein folding, using the results of molecular dynamics simulations on numerous coarse-grained C-alpha-model single-domain proteins. After adding three-body interactions explicitly as a perturbation to a Go-like Hamiltonian with native pair-wise interactions only, we have found 1) a significantly increased correlation with experimental phi-values and folding rates, 2) a stronger correlation of folding rate with contact order, matching the experimental range in rates when the fraction of three-body energy in the native state is ~ 20%, and 3) a considerably larger amount of 3-body energy present in Chymotripsin inhibitor than other proteins studied.",Human
"Naturally occurring networks exhibit quantitative features revealing underlying growth mechanisms. Numerous network mechanisms have recently been proposed to reproduce specific properties such as degree distributions or clustering coefficients. We present a method for inferring the mechanism most accurately capturing a given network topology, exploiting discriminative tools from machine learning. The Drosophila melanogaster protein network is confidently and robustly (to noise and training data subsampling) classified as a duplication-mutation-complementation network over preferential attachment, small-world, and other duplication-mutation mechanisms. Systematic classification, rather than statistical study of specific properties, provides a discriminative approach to understand the design of complex networks.",Human
"Recent studies of in vitro evolution of DNA via protein binding indicate that the evolution behavior is qualitatively different in different parameter regimes. I here present a general theory that is valid for a wide range of parameters, and which reproduces and extends previous results. Specifically, the mean-field theory of a general translation-invariant model can be reduced to the basic diffusion equation with a dynamic boundary condition. The simple analytical form yields both quantitatively accurate predictions and valuable insight into the principles involved. In particular, I introduce a cutoff criterion for finite populations that illustrates both of these qualities.",Human
"Intermittent density fluctuations of nucleotide molecules (adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine) along DNA sequences are studied in the framework of a hierarchical structure (HS) model originally proposed for the study of fully developed turbulence [She and Leque, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72}, 336 (1994)]. Large scale (10^3 < \ell < 10^5 bp) base density fluctuation is shown to satisfy the HS similarity. The derived values of a HS parameter $\beta$ from a large number of genome data (including Bacteria, Archaea, human chromosomes and viruses) characterize different biological properties such as strand symmetry, phylogenetic relations and horizontal gene transfer. It is suggested that the HS analysis offers a useful quantitative description for heterogeneity, sequence complexity and large scale structures of genomes.",Human
"Simple memorizing tasks have been chosen such as a binary code on a matrix. After the establishment of an appropriate protocol, the codified matrices were individually presented to 150 university students who had to memorize them. A computer simulation for a similar task is available which uses a perceptron on which an algorithm was implemented allowing for some degree of globality (technically referred to as entropic nonextensivity within a current generalization of the usual, Boltzmann-Gibbs, statistical mechanics). Our main observation is that, for the very specific learning task on which we focus here, humans perform similarly to slightly nonextensive perceptrons.",Human
"We propose and test a pair potential that is accurate at all relevant distances and simple enough for use in large-scale computer simulations. A combination of the Rydberg potential from spectroscopy and the London inverse-sixth-power energy, the proposed form fits spectroscopically determined potentials better than the Morse, Varnshi, and Hulburt-Hirschfelder potentials and much better than the Lennard-Jones and harmonic potentials. At long distances, it goes smoothly to the correct London force appropriate for gases and preserves van der Waals's ""continuity of the gas and liquid states,"" which is routinely violated by coefficients assigned to the Lennard-Jones 6-12 form.",Human
"Exact numerical methods and stochastic simulation methods are developed to study the force stretching single RNA issue on the secondary structure level in equilibrium. By computing the force-extension curves on the constant force and the constant extension ensembles, we find the two independent methods agree with each other quite well. To show the precision of our methods in predicting unfolding experiments, the unfolding forces of different RNA molecules under different experimental conditions are calculated. We find that the ionic corrections on the RNA free energies alone might not account for the apparent differences between the theoretical calculations and the experimental data; an ionic correction to the persistent length of single-stranded RNA should be necessary.",Human
"An oscillation with a period of around 500 kb in guanine and cytosine content (GC%) is observed in the DNA sequence of human chromosome 21. This oscillation is localized in the rightmost one-eighth region of the chromosome, from 43.5 Mb to 46.5 Mb. Five cycles of oscillation are observed in this region with six GC-rich peaks and five GC-poor valleys. The GC-poor valleys comprise regions with low density of CpG islands and, alternating between the two DNA strands, low gene density regions. Consequently, the long-range oscillation of GC% result in spacing patterns of both CpG island density, and to a lesser extent, gene densities.",Human
"DNA looping participates in transcriptional regulation, for instance, by allowing distal binding sites to act synergistically. Here we study this process and compare different regulatory mechanisms based on repression with and without looping. Within a simple mathematical model for the lac operon, we show that regulation based on DNA looping, in addition to increasing the repression level, can reduce the fluctuations of transcription and, at the same time, decrease the sensitivity to changes in the number of regulatory proteins. Looping is thus able to circumvent some of the constraints inherent to mechanisms based solely on binding to a single operator site and provides a mechanism to regulate not only the average properties of transcription but also its fluctuations.",Human
"The spatial distribution of neuronal cells is an important requirement for achieving proper neuronal function in several parts of the nervous system of most animals. For instance, specific distribution of photoreceptors and related neuronal cells, particularly the ganglion cells, in mammal's retina is required in order to properly sample the projected scene. This work presents how two concepts from the areas of statistical mechanics and complex systems, namely the \emph{lacunarity} and the \emph{multiscale entropy} (i.e. the entropy calculated over progressively diffused representations of the cell mosaic), have allowed effective characterization of the spatial distribution of retinal cells.",Human
"This work describes neural software applied in medicine and physiology to: investigate and diagnose immune deficiencies; diagnose and study allergic and pseudoallergic reactions; forecast emergence or aggravation of stagnant cardiac insufficiency in patients with cardiac rhythm disorders; forecast development of cardiac arrhythmia after myocardial infarction; reveal relationships between the accumulated radiation dose and a set of immunological, hormonal, and bio-chemical parameters of human blood and find a method to be able to judge by these parameters the dose value; propose a technique for early diagnosis of chor-oid melanomas; Neural networks also help to predict human relations within a group.",Human
"Finite size effects on the cooperative thermal denaturation of proteins are considered. A dimensionless measure of cooperativity, Omega, scales as N^zeta, where N is the number of amino acids. Surprisingly, we find that zeta is universal with zeta = 1 + gamma, where the exponent gamma characterizes the divergence of the susceptibility for a self-avoiding walk. Our lattice model simulations and experimental data are consistent with the theory. Our finding rationalizes the marginal stability of proteins and substantiates the earlier predictions that the efficient folding of two-state proteins requires the folding transition temperature to be close to the collapse temperature.",Human
"We show that the protein-protein interaction networks can be surprisingly well described by a very simple evolution model of duplication and divergence. The model exhibits a remarkably rich behavior depending on a single parameter, the probability to retain a duplicated link during divergence. When this parameter is large, the network growth is not self-averaging and an average vertex degree increases algebraically. The lack of self-averaging results in a great diversity of networks grown out of the same initial condition. For small values of the link retention probability, the growth is self-averaging, the average degree increases very slowly or tends to a constant, and a degree distribution has a power-law tail.",Human
"Finite size effects on the calorimetric cooperatity of the folding-unfolding transition in two-state proteins are considered using the Go lattice models with and without side chains. We show that for models without side chains a dimensionless measure of calorimetric cooperativity kappa2 defined as the ratio of the van't Hoff to calorimetric enthalpy does not depend on the number of amino acids N. The average value of kappa2 is about 3/4 which is lower than the experimental value kappa2=1. For models with side chains kappa2 approaches unity as kappa2 \sim N^mu, where exponent mu=0.17. Above the critical chain length Nc =135 these models can mimic the truly all-or-non folding-unfolding transition.",Human
"Sequence comparison across multiple organisms aids in the detection of regions under selection. However, resource limitations require a prioritization of genomes to be sequenced. This prioritization should be grounded in two considerations: the lineal scope encompassing the biological phenomena of interest, and the optimal species within that scope for detecting functional elements. We introduce a statistical framework for optimal species subset selection, based on maximizing power to detect conserved sites. In a study of vertebrate species, we show that the optimal species subset is not in general the most evolutionarily diverged subset. Our results suggest that marsupials are prime sequencing candidates.",Human
"A great part of the effort in the study of coarse grained models of transcription networks is directed to the analysis of their dynamical features. In this letter, we consider the \emph{equilibrium} properties of such systems, showing that the logic backbone underlying all dynamic descriptions has the structure of a computational optimization problem. It involves variables, which correspond to gene expression levels, and constraints, which describe the effect of \emph{cis-}regulatory signal integration functions. In the simple paradigmatic case of Boolean variables and signal integration functions, we derive and discuss phase diagrams. Notably, the model exhibits a connectivity transition between a regime of simple, but uncertain, gene control, to a regime of complex combinatorial control.",Human
Bone structure in mammals involves a complex network of channels (Havers and Volkmann channels) required to nourish the bone marrow cells. This work describes how three-dimensional reconstructions of such systems can be obtained and represented in terms of complex networks. Three important findings are reported: (i) the fact that the channel branching density resembles a power law implies the existence of distribution hubs; (ii) the conditional node degree density indicates a clear tendency of connection between nodes with degrees 2 and 4; and (iii) the application of the recently introduced concept of hierarchical clustering coefficient allows the identification of typical scales of channel redistribution. A series of important biological insights is drawn and discussed,Human
"Network of packages with regulatory interactions (dependences and conflicts) from Debian GNU/Linux operating system is compiled and used as analogy of a gene regulatory network. Using a trace-back algorithm we assembly networks from the potential pool of packages for both scale-free and exponential topology from real and a null model data, respectively. We calculate the maximum number of packages that can be functionally installed in the system (i.e., the active network size). We show that scale-free regulatory networks allow a larger active network size than random ones. Small genomes with scale-free regulatory topology could allow much more functionality than large genomes with an exponential one, with implications on its dynamics, robustness and evolution.",Human
"A population of complete subgraphs or cliques in a network evolving via duplication-divergence is considered. We find that a number of cliques of each size scales linearly with the size of the network. We also derive a clique population distribution that is in perfect agreement with both the simulation results and the clique statistic of the protein-protein binding network of the fruit fly. In addition, we show that such features as fat-tail degree distribution, various rates of average degree growth and non-averaging, revealed recently for only the particular case of a completely asymmetric divergence, are present in a general case of arbitrary divergence.",Human
"We determine both barrier heights and prefactors for protein folding by applying constraints determined from experimental rate measurements to a Kramers theory for folding rate. The theoretical values are required to match the experimental values at two conditions of temperature and denaturant that induce the same stability. Several expressions for the prefactor in the Kramers rate equation are examined: a random energy approximation, a correlated energy approximation, and an approximation using a single Arrhenius activation energy. Barriers and prefactors are generally found to be large as a result of implementing this recipe, i.e. the folding landscape is cooperative and smooth. Interestingly, a prefactor with a single Arrhenius activation energy admits no formal solution.",Human
"We extend replica exchange simulation in two ways, and apply our approaches to biomolecules. The first generalization permits exchange simulation between models of differing resolution -- i.e., between detailed and coarse-grained models. Such ``resolution exchange'' can be applied to molecular systems or spin systems. The second extension is to ``pseudo-exchange'' simulations, which require little CPU usage for most levels of the exchange ladder and also substantially reduces the need for overlap between levels. Pseudo exchanges can be used in either replica or resolution exchange simulations. We perform efficient, converged simulations of a 50-atom peptide to illustrate the new approaches.",Human
"Identity, response to external stimuli, and spatial architecture of a living system are central topics of molecular biology. Presently, they are largely seen as a result of the interplay between a gene repertoire and the regulatory machinery of the cell. At the transcriptional level, the cis-regulatory regions establish sets of interdependencies between transcription factors and genes, including other transcription factors. These ``transcription networks'' are too large to be approached globally with a detailed dynamical model. In this paper, we describe an approach to this problem that focuses solely on the compatibility between gene expression patterns and signal integration functions, discussing calculations carried on the simplest, Boolean, realization of the model, and a first application to experimental data sets.",Human
"This paper deals with a new model for clonal network dynamics. We describe in detail this model and derive special equations governing immune system dynamics based on the general gradient type principles that can be inherent to a wide class of real living objects. A special clonal network is modeled by two symmetric projector matrix variables simultaneously taking into account both asymmetry of the interaction to each other and adaptation states that can be realized owing to possible idiotypic clonal suppresions. We perform computer simulations of the model dynamics for some simple cases of relatively low dimension, paying special attention to the dynamics of amounts of activated receptor strings within clonal network.",Human
"The formation of DNA loops by proteins and protein complexes that bind at distal DNA sites plays a central role in many cellular processes, such as transcription, recombination, and replication. Here we review the basic thermodynamic concepts underlying the assembly of macromolecular complexes on looped DNA and the effects that this process has in the properties of gene regulation. Beyond the traditional view of DNA looping as a mechanism to increase the affinity of regulatory molecules for their cognate sites, recent developments indicate that DNA looping can also lead to the suppression of cell-to-cell variability, the control of transcriptional noise, and the activation of cooperative interactions on demand.",Human
"This short technical paper advocates a bootstrapping algorithm from which we can form a statistically reliable opinion based on limited clinically observed data, regarding whether an osteo-hyperplasia could actually be a case of Ewing's osteosarcoma. The basic premise underlying our methodology is that a primary bone tumour, if it is indeed Erwing's osteosarcoma, cannot increase in volume beyond some critical limit without showing metastasis. We propose a statistical method to extrapolate such critical limit to primary tumour volume. Our model does not involve any physiological variables but rather is entirely based on time series observations of increase in primary tumour volume from the point of initial detection to the actual detection of metastases.",Human
"The architecture of the network of protein-protein physical interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is exposed through the combination of two complementary theoretical network measures, betweenness centrality and `Q-modularity'. The yeast interactome is characterized by well-defined topological modules connected via a small number of inter-module protein interactions. Should such topological inter-module connections turn out to constitute a form of functional coordination between the modules, we speculate that this coordination is occurring typically in a pair-wise fashion, rather than by way of high-degree hub proteins responsible for coordinating multiple modules. The unique non-hub-centric hierarchical organization of the interactome is not reproduced by gene duplication-and-divergence stochastic growth models that disregard global selective pressures.",Human
"We introduce and discuss a minimal individual-based model for influenza dynamics. The model takes into account the effects of specific immunization against viral strains, but also infectivity randomness and the presence of a short-lived strain transcending immunity recently suggested in the literature. We show by simulations that the resulting model exhibits substitution of viral strains along the years, but that their divergence remains bounded. We also show that dropping any of these features results in a drastically different behavior, leading either to the extinction of the disease, to the proliferation of the viral strains, or to their divergence.",Human
"We present a model that considers the maturation of the antibody population following primary antigen presentation as a global optimization problem. The trade-off that emerges from our model describes the balance between the safety of mutations that lead to local improvements in affinity and the necessity of the system to undergo global reconfigurations in the antibody's shape in order to achieve its goals, in this example of fast-paced evolution. The parameter p which quantifies this trade-off appears to be itself both robust and evolvable. This parallels the rapidity and consistency of the optimization operating during the biologic response. In this paper, we explore the robust qualities and evolvability of this tunable control parameter, p.",Human
"We study two mechanisms for the formation of protein patterns near membranes of living cells by mathematical modelling. Self-assembly of protein domains by electrostatic lipid-protein interactions is contrasted with self-organization due to a nonequilibrium biochemical reaction cycle of proteins near the membrane. While both processes lead eventually to quite similar patterns, their evolution occurs on very different length and time scales. Self-assembly produces periodic protein patterns on a spatial scale below 0.1 micron in a few seconds followed by extremely slow coarsening, whereas self-organization results in a pattern wavelength comparable to the typical cell size of 100 micron within a few minutes suggesting different biological functions for the two processes.",Human
"We introduce a symbolic representation like set theory to consider ecologic interactions between species (ECOSET). The ecologic exclusion principle (Gause) is put in a symbolic way and used as operational tool to consider more complex cases like interaction with sterile species (SIT technique), two species with two superposed sources (niche differentiation) and N+P species competing by N resources, etc. Displacement (regional or characters) is also considered by using this basic tool. Our symbolic notation gives us an operative and easy way to consider elementary process in ecology. Some experimental data (laboratory or field) for ecologic process are re-considered under the optic of this set-theory.",Human
"Some microbes appear to be able to metabolize in glacial ice or permafrost. The rate depends on temperature, nutrient level, and bioelement availability, among other factors. I have developed a plausible argument that they do this while confined in veins filled with acidic or saline solution that provides nutrients and elements necessary for growth. Here I develop this scenario further and discuss some of its implications for ice-covered planetary bodies and for the the origin of life. An accompanying paper in the conference proceedings (Bay et al.) discusses plans to test this hypothesis using epifluorescence microscopy of pristine, unmelted ice samples and an optical biospectrologging tool to assay living and dead microbes in boreholes in glacial ice.",Human
"We report measurements of the brain activity of subjects engaged in behavioral exchanges with their environments. We observe brain states which are characterized by coordinated oscillation of populations of neurons that are changing rapidly with the evolution of the meaningful relationship between the subject and its environment, established and maintained by active perception. Sequential spatial patterns of neural activity with high information content found in sensory cortices of trained animals between onsets of conditioned stimuli and conditioned responses resemble cinematographic frames. They are not readily amenable to description either with classical integrodifferential equations or with the matrix algebras of neural networks. Their modeling is provided by field theory from condensed matter physics.",Human
"Most population models assume that individuals within a given population are identical, that is, the fundamental role of variation is ignored. Inhomogeneous models of populations and communities allow for birth and death rates to vary among individuals; recently, theorems of existence and asymptotic of solutions of such models were investigated. Here we develop another approach to modeling heterogeneous populations by reducing the model to the Cauchy problem for a special system of ODEs. As a result, the total population size and current distribution of the vector-parameter can be found in explicit analytical form or computed effectively. The developed approach is extended to the models of inhomogeneous communities.",Human
"Faced with a sequence of N binary events, such as coin flips (or Ising spins), it is natural to ask whether these events reflect some underlying dynamic signals or are just random. Plausible models for the dynamics of hidden biases lead to surprisingly high probabilities of misidentifying random sequences as biased. In particular, this probability decays as N^(-1/4), so that no reasonable amount of data would be sufficient to induce the concept of a fair coin with high probability. I suggest that these theoretical results may be relevant to understanding experiments on the apparent misperception of random sequences by human observers.",Human
"Most population models assume that individuals within a given population are identical, that is, the fundamental role of variation is ignored. Here we develop a general approach to modeling heterogeneous populations with discrete evolutionary time step. The theory is applied to population dynamics of natural rotifer populations. We show that under particular conditions the behavior of the inhomogeneous model possesses complex transition regimes, which depends both on the mean and the variance of the initial parameter distribution and the final state of the population depends on the least possible value from the domain of the parameter. The question of persistence of the population is discussed.",Human
"The study of Planktonic Foraminifera abundances permits to obtain climatic curves on the basis of percentage ratio between tropical and temperate/polar forms. Climatic changes were controlled by several phenomena as: (i) Milankovitch's cycles, produced by variations of astronomical parameters such as precession, obliquity and eccentricity; (ii) continental geodynamic evolution and orogenic belt; (iii) variations of atmospheric and oceanic currents; (iv) volcanic eruptions; (v) meteor impacts. But while astronomical parameters have a quasi-regular periodicity, the other phenomena can be considered as ""noise signal"" in natural systems. The interplay between cyclical astronomical variations, the ""noise signal"" and the intrinsic nonlinearity of the ecologic system produces strong glacial or interglacial period according to the stochastic resonance phenomenon.",Human
"We introduce a Markov model for the evolution of a gene family along a phylogeny. The model includes parameters for the rates of horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and gene loss, in addition to branch lengths in the phylogeny. The likelihood for the changes in the size of a gene family across different organisms can be calculated in O(N+hM^2) time and O(N+M^2) space, where N is the number of organisms, $h$ is the height of the phylogeny, and M is the sum of family sizes. We apply the model to the evolution of gene content in Preoteobacteria using the gene families in the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) database.",Human
"In comparative and developmental neuroanatomy one encounters questions regarding the deformation of neural tissue under stress. The motivation of this note is an observation (Barbas {\it et al}) that at cortical folds or gyri, the layers of neural tissue show relative thickening or thinning of upper or deep layers. In general, the material properties of a slab of neural tissue are not known, and even if known, would probably lead to a difficult problem in elasticity theory. Here a simple argument is presented to show that bending an elastic slab should produce a relative thickening of the layers on the inside of the bend. The argument is based on the incompressibility of the material and should therefore be fairly robust.",Human
"It is increasingly evident that there is more to biological evolution than natural selection; moreover, the concept of evolution is not limited to biology. We propose an integrative framework for characterizing how entities evolve, in which evolution is viewed as a process of context-driven actualization of potential (CAP). Processes of change differ according to the degree of nondeterminism, and the degree to which they are sensitive to, internalize, and depend upon a particular context. The approach enables us to embed phenomena across disciplines into a broad conceptual framework. We give examples of insights into physics, biology, culture and cognition that derive from this unifying framework.",Human
"We investigate a mechanism for the robust identification of the center of a developing biological system. We assume the existence of two morphogen gradients, an activator emanating from the anterior, and a co-repressor from the posterior. The co-repressor inhibits the action of the activator in switching on target genes. We apply this system to Drosophila embryos, where we predict the existence of a hitherto undetected posterior co-repressor. Using mathematical modelling, we show that a symmetric activator-co-repressor model can quantitatively explain the precise mid-embryo expression boundary of the hunchback gene, and the scaling of this pattern with embryo size.",Human
"As a first step in the search of an analytical study of mechanical denaturation of DNA in terms of the sequence, we study stable, stationary solutions in the discrete, finite and homogeneous Peyrard-Bishop DNA model. We find and classify all the stationary solutions of the model, as well as analytic approximations of them, both in the continuum and in the discrete limits. Our results explain the structure of the solutions reported by Theodorakopoulos {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 258101 (2004)] and provide a way to proceed to the analysis of the generalized version of the model incorporating the genetic information.",Human
The relationship between the design and functionality of molecular networks is now a key issue in biology. Comparison of regulatory networks performing similar tasks can give insights into how network architecture is constrained by the functions it directs. We here discuss methods of network comparison based on network architecture and signaling logic. Introducing local and global signaling scores for the difference between two networks we quantify similarities between evolutionary closely and distantly related bacteriophages. Despite the large evolutionary separation between phage $\lambda$ and 186 their networks are found to be similar when difference is measured in terms of global signaling. We finally discuss how network alignment can be used to to pinpoint protein similarities viewed from the network perspective.,Human
"In order to elucidate the role of the native state topology and the stability of subdomains in protein folding, we investigate free energy landscape of human lysozyme, which is composed of two subdomains, by Monte Carlo simulations. A realistic lattice model with Go-like interaction is used. We take the relative interaction strength (stability, in other word) of two subdomains as a variable parameter and study the folding process. A variety of folding process is observed and we obtained a phase diagram of folding in terms of temperature and the relative stability. Experimentally-observed diversity in folding process of c-type lysozimes is thus understood as a consequence of the difference in the relative stability of subdomains.",Human
"Single-molecule tracking is a powerful way to look at the dynamic organization of plasma membranes. However, there are some limitations to its use. For example, it was recently observed, using numerical simulation, that time-averaging effects inherent to the exposure time of detectors are likely to bias the apparent motion of molecules confined in microdomains. Here, we solve this apparently limiting issue analytically. We explore this phenomenon by calculating its effects on the observed diffusion coefficients and domain sizes. We demonstrate that the real parameters can be easily recovered from the measured apparent ones. Interestingly, we find that single-molecule tracking can be used to explore events occurring at a timescale smaller than the exposure time.",Human
"Fuzzy cognitive mapping was used to understand the wants and desires of local people before resettlement. Variables that the affected people think will increase their welfare during and after dam construction were determined. Simulations were done with their cumulative social cognitive map to determine which policy options would most increase their welfare. The construction of roads, job opportunities, advance payment of condemnation value, and schools are central variables that had the most effect on increasing people's income and welfare. The synergistic effects of variables demonstrated that the implementation of different policies not only add cumulatively to the people's welfare but also have an increased effect.",Human
"Many networks in natural and human-made systems exhibit scale-free properties and are small worlds. Now we show that people's understanding of complex systems in their cognitive maps also follow a scale-free topology. People focus on a few attributes, relating these with many other things in the system. Many more attributes have very few connections. People use relatively short explanations to describe events; their cognitive map is a small world with less than six degrees of separation. These findings may help us to better understand people's perceptions, especially when it comes to decision-making, conflict resolution, politics and management.",Human
We apply a recently developed adaptive algorithm that systematically improves the efficiency of parallel tempering or replica exchange methods in the numerical simulation of small proteins. Feedback iterations allow us to identify an optimal set of temperatures/replicas which are found to concentrate at the bottlenecks of the simulations. A measure of convergence for the equilibration of the parallel tempering algorithm is discussed. We test our algorithm by simulating the 36-residue villin headpiece sub-domain HP-36 wherewe find a lowest-energy configuration with a root-mean-square-deviation of less than 4 Angstroem to the experimentally determined structure.,Human
"The in vivo free energy of looping double-stranded DNA by the lac repressor has a remarkable behavior whose origins are not fully understood. In addition to the intrinsic periodicity of the DNA double helix, the in vivo free energy has an oscillatory component of about half the helical period and oscillates asymmetrically with an amplitude significantly smaller than predicted by current theories. Here, we show that the in vivo behavior is accurately accounted for by the simultaneous presence of two distinct conformations of looped DNA. Our analysis reveals that these two conformations have different optimal free energies and phases and that they behave distinctly in the presence of key architectural proteins.",Human
"A chemical kinetic model of the elongation dynamics of RNA polymerase along a DNA sequence is introduced. The proposed model governs the discrete movement of the RNA polymerase along a DNA template, with no consideration given to elastic effects. The model's novel concept is a ``look-ahead'' feature, in which nucleotides bind reversibly to the DNA prior to being incorporated covalently into the nascent RNA chain. Results are presented for specific DNA sequences that have been used in single-molecule experiments of the random walk of RNA polymerase along DNA. By replicating the data analysis algorithm from the experimental procedure, the model produces velocity histograms, enabling direct comparison with these published results.",Human
"We describe a mechanism for pronounced biochemical oscillations, relevant to microscopic systems, such as the intracellular environment. This mechanism operates for reaction schemes which, when modeled using deterministic rate equations, fail to exhibit oscillations for any values of rate constants. The mechanism relies on amplification of the underlying stochasticity of reaction kinetics within a narrow window of frequencies. This amplification allows fluctuations to beat the central limit theorem, having a dominant effect even though the number of molecules in the system is relatively large. The mechanism is quantitatively studied within simple models of self-regulatory gene expression, and glycolytic oscillations.",Human
"We provide a mean-field analysis of community structure of social and biological networks assuming that actors are able to evaluate some tree-derived distance to the other actors and tend to aggregate with the less distant. We show that such networks have small components, and give exact descriptions for the probability distribution of a typical community size and the number of communities. In particular, we show that the probability distribution of the community size is well-approximated by a power-law distribution with exponent two. We illustrate the robustness of the mean-field analysis by comparing its predictions on previously studied social networks and biological data.",Human
"The search for similarity and dissimilarity measures on phylogenetic trees has been motivated by the computation of consensus trees, the search by similarity in phylogenetic databases, and the assessment of clustering results in bioinformatics. The transposition distance for fully resolved phylogenetic trees is a recent addition to the extensive collection of available metrics for comparing phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we generalize the transposition distance from fully resolved to arbitrary phylogenetic trees, through a construction that involves an embedding of the set of phylogenetic trees with a fixed number of labeled leaves into a symmetric group and a generalization of Reidys-Stadler's involution metric for RNA contact structures. We also present simple linear-time algorithms for computing it.",Human
"A stochastic model for the activation of T-cells is analysed. T-cells are part of the immune system and recognize foreign antigens against a background of the body's own molecules. The model under consideration is a slight generalization of a model introduced by Van den Berg, Rand and Burroughs in 2001, and is capable of explaining how this recognition works on the basis of rare stochastic events. With the help of a refined large deviation theorem and numerical evaluation it is shown that, for a wide range of parameters, T-cells can distinguish reliably between foreign antigens and self-antigens.",Human
"We investigate a social system of agents faced with a binary choice. We assume there is a correct, or beneficial, outcome of this choice. Furthermore, we assume agents are influenced by others in making their decision, and that the agents can obtain information that may guide them towards making a correct decision. The dynamic model we propose is of nonequilibrium type, converging to a final decision. We run it on random graphs and scale-free networks. On random graphs, we find two distinct regions in terms of the ""finalizing time"" -- the time until all agents have finalized their decisions. On scale-free networks on the other hand, there does not seem to be any such distinct scaling regions.",Human
"Spatially distributed problems are often approximately modelled in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs) for appropriate coarse-grained quantities (e.g. concentrations). The derivation of accurate such PDEs starting from finer scale, atomistic models, and using suitable averaging, is often a challenging task; approximate PDEs are typically obtained through mathematical closure procedures (e.g. mean-field approximations). In this paper, we show how such approximate macroscopic PDEs can be exploited in constructing preconditioners to accelerate stochastic simulations for spatially distributed particle-based process models. We illustrate how such preconditioning can improve the convergence of equation-free coarse-grained methods based on coarse timesteppers. Our model problem is a stochastic reaction-diffusion model capable of exhibiting Turing instabilities.",Human
"Microtubules (MTs) are important cytoskeletal structures, engaged in a number of specific cellular activities, including vesicular traffic, cell cyto-architecture and motility, cell division, and information processing within neuronal processes. MTs have also been implicated in higher neuronal functions, including memory, and the emergence of ""consciousness"". How MTs handle and process electrical information, however, is heretofore unknown. Here we show new electrodynamic properties of MTs. Isolated, taxol-stabilized microtubules behave as bio-molecular transistors capable of amplifying electrical information. Electrical amplification by MTs can lead to the enhancement of dynamic information, and processivity in neurons can be conceptualized as an ""ionic-based"" transistor, which may impact among other known functions, neuronal computational capabilities.",Human
"We study coarse-grained (group-level) alignment dynamics of individual-based animal group models for {\it heterogeneous} populations consisting of informed (on preferred directions) and uninformed individuals. The orientation of each individual is characterized by an angle, whose dynamics are nonlinearly coupled with those of all the other individuals, with an explicit dependence on the difference between the individual's orientation and the instantaneous average direction. Choosing convenient coarse-grained variables (suggested by uncertainty quantification methods) that account for rapidly developing correlations during initial transients, we perform efficient computations of coarse-grained steady states and their bifurcation analysis. We circumvent the derivation of coarse-grained governing equations, following an equation-free computational approach.",Human
"The biochemical changes on normal and degenerated tissues of rotator cuff supraspinatus tendons were probed by FT-Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra showed differences on the spectral regions of cysteine, amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. These spectral differences were assigned to pathological biochemical alterations due to the degenerative process of the tendon. Principal Components Analysis was performed on the spectral data and enabled the correct classification of the spectra as normal (grade 1) and degenerated (grades 2 and 3). These findings indicate that Raman spectroscopy could be a very promising tool for the rotator cuff supraspinatus tendon diagnosis and for quantification of their degenerative degree.",Human
"The distribution of bubble lengths in double-stranded DNA is presented for segments of varying guanine-cytosine (GC) content, obtained with Monte Carlo simulations using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model at 310 K. An analytical description of the obtained distribution in the whole regime investigated, i.e., up to bubble widths of the order of tens of nanometers, is available. We find that the decay lengths and characteristic exponents of this distribution show two distinct regimes as a function of GC content. The observed distribution is attributed to the anharmonic interactions within base pairs. The results are discussed in the framework of the Poland-Scheraga and the Peyrard-Bishop (with linear instead of nonlinear stacking interaction) models.",Human
"In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. E 68, 011906 (2003)], Naef and Magnasco suggested that the ""bright"" mismatches observed in Affymetrix microarray experiments are caused by the fluorescent molecules used to label RNA target sequences, which would impede target-probe hybridization. Their conclusion is based on the observation of ""unexpected"" asymmetries in the affinities obtained by fitting microarray data from publicly available experiments. We point out here that the observed asymmetry is due to the inequivalence of RNA and DNA, and that the reported affinities are consistent with stacking free energies obtained from melting experiments of unlabeled nucleic acids in solution. The conclusion of Naef and Magnasco is therefore based on an unjustified assumption.",Human
"During each ovarian cycle, only a definite number of follicles ovulate, while the others undergo a degeneration process called atresia. We have designed a multi-scale mathematical model where ovulation and atresia result from a hormonal controlled selection process. A 2D-conservation law describes the age and maturity structuration of the follicular cell population. In this paper, we focus on the operating mode of the control, through the study of the characteristics of the conservation law. We describe in particular the set of microscopic initial conditions leading to the macroscopic phenomenon of either ovulation or atresia, in the framework of backwards reachable sets theory.",Human
"The concepts and methods of Systems Biology are being extended to neuropharmacology, to test and design drugs against neurological and psychiatric disorders. Computational modeling by integrating compartmental neural modeling technique and detailed kinetic description of pharmacological modulation of transmitter-receptor interaction is offered as a method to test the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of putative drugs. Even more, an inverse method is suggested as a method for controlling a neural system to realize a prescribed temporal pattern. In particular, as an application of the proposed new methodology a computational platform is offered to analyze the generation and pharmacological modulation of theta rhythm related to anxiety is analyzed here in more detail.",Human
"It is often useful in multivariate time series analysis to determine statistical causal relations between different time series. Granger causality is a fundamental measure for this purpose. Yet the traditional pairwise approach to Granger causality analysis may not clearly distinguish between direct causal influences from one time series to another and indirect ones acting through a third time series. In order to differentiate direct from indirect Granger causality, a conditional Granger causality measure in the frequency domain is derived based on a partition matrix technique. Simulations and an application to neural field potential time series are demonstrated to validate the method.",Human
"Many networks are important because they are substrates for dynamical systems, and their pattern of functional connectivity can itself be dynamic -- they can functionally reorganize, even if their underlying anatomical structure remains fixed. However, the recent rapid progress in discovering the community structure of networks has overwhelmingly focused on that constant anatomical connectivity. In this paper, we lay out the problem of discovering_functional communities_, and describe an approach to doing so. This method combines recent work on measuring information sharing across stochastic networks with an existing and successful community-discovery algorithm for weighted networks. We illustrate it with an application to a large biophysical model of the transition from beta to gamma rhythms in the hippocampus.",Human
"Dynamics of a social population is analyzed taking into account some physical constraints on individual behavior and decision making abilities. The model, based on Evolutionary Game Theory, predicts that a population has to pass through a series of different games, e.g as a consequence of environmental fluctuations, in order to develop social cooperation and communication skills. It differs from the general assumption that evolution of cooperation, the so called Cooperation Paradox, can be explained by a single set of rules for intra-population competitions. The developed methods, potentially, have a practical value for some learning optimization problems in multiagent, e.g. corporate, environment.",Human
"This research explores the role and representation of network structure for LTI Systems. We demonstrate that transfer functions contain no structural information without more assumptions being made about the system, assumptions that we believe are unreasonable when dealing with truly complex systems. We then introduce Dynamical Structure Functions as an alternative, graphical-model based representation of LTI systems that contain both dynamical and structural information of the system. We use Dynamical Structure to prove necessary and sufficient conditions for estimating structure from data, and demonstrate, for example, the danger of attempting to use steady-state information to estimate network structure.",Human
"We apply the methods of optimal experimental design to a differential equation model for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, trafficking, and down-regulation. The model incorporates the role of a recently discovered protein complex made up of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cbl, the guanine exchange factor (GEF), Cool-1 (Beta-Pix), and the Rho family G protein Cdc42. The complex has been suggested to be important in disrupting receptor down-regulation. We demonstrate that the model interactions can accurately reproduce the experimental observations, that they can be used to make predictions with accompanying uncertainties, and that we can apply ideas of optimal experimental design to suggest new experiments that reduce the uncertainty on unmeasurable components of the system.",Human
"Kinesin and related motor proteins utilize ATP fuel to propel themselves along the external surface of microtubules in a processive and directional fashion. We show that the observed step-like motion is possible through time varying charge distributions furnished by the ATP hydrolysis circle while the static charge configuration on the microtuble provides the guide for motion. Thus, while the chemical hydrolysis energy induces appropriate local conformational changes, the motor translational energy is fundamentally electrostatic. Numerical simulations of the mechanical equations of motion show that processivity and directionality are direct consequences of the ATP-dependent electrostatic interaction between the different charge distributions of kinesin and microtubule.",Human
"A mathematical theory on flocking serves the foundation for several ubiquitous multi-agent phenomena in biology, ecology, sensor networks, economy, as well as social behavior like language emergence and evolution. Directly inspired by the recent fundamental works of Cucker and Smale on the construction and analysis of a generic flocking model, we study the emergent behavior of Cucker-Smale flocking under hierarchical leadership. The rates of convergence towards asymptotically coherent group patterns in different scenarios are established.   The consistent convergence towards coherent patterns may well reveal the advantages and necessities of having leaders and leadership in a complex (biological, technological, economic, or social) system with sufficient intelligence.",Human
"We present a dynamical model of lipoprotein metabolism derived by combining a cascading process in the blood stream and cellular level regulatory dynamics. We analyse the existence and stability of equilibria and show that this low-dimensional, nonlinear model exhibits bistability between a low and a high cholesterol state. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the intracellular concentration of cholesterol is robust to parametric variations while the plasma cholesterol can vary widely. We show how the dynamical response to time-dependent inputs can be used to diagnose the state of the system. We also establish the connection between parameters in the system and medical and genetic conditions.",Human
"We consider communication when there is no agreement about symbols and meanings. We treat it within the framework of reinforcement learning. We apply different reinforcement learning models in our studies and simplify the problem as much as possible. We show that the modelling of the other agent is insufficient in the simplest possible case, unless the intentions can also be modelled. The model of the agent and its intentions enable quick agreements about symbol-meaning association. We show that when both agents assume an `intention model' about the other agent then the symbol-meaning association process can be spoiled and symbol meaning association may become hard.",Human
"We propose a growing network model that consists of two tunable mechanisms: growth by merging modules which are represented as complete graphs and a fitness-driven preferential attachment. Our model exhibits the three prominent statistical properties are widely shared in real biological networks, for example gene regulatory, protein-protein interaction, and metabolic networks. They retain three power law relationships, such as the power laws of degree distribution, clustering spectrum, and degree-degree correlation corresponding to scale-free connectivity, hierarchical modularity, and disassortativity, respectively. After making comparisons of these properties between model networks and biological networks, we confirmed that our model has inference potential for evolutionary processes of biological networks.",Human
"The human genotope is the convex hull of all allele frequency vectors that can be obtained from the genotypes present in the human population. In this paper we take a few initial steps towards a description of this object, which may be fundamental for future population based genetics studies. Here we use data from the HapMap Project, restricted to two ENCODE regions, to study a subpolytope of the human genotope. We study three different approaches for obtaining informative low-dimensional projections of this subpolytope. The projections are specified by projection onto few tag SNPs, principal component analysis, and archetypal analysis. We describe the application of our geometric approach to identifying structure in populations based on single nucleotide polymorphisms.",Human
"In this paper phase of a signal has been viewed from a different angle. According to this view a signal can have countably infinitely many phases, one associated with each Fourier component. In other words each frequency has a phase associated with it. It has been shown that if two signals are phase synchronous then the difference between phases at a given component changes very slowly across the subsequent components. This leads to an FFT based phase synchronization measuring algorithm between any two signals. The algorithm does not take any more time than the FFT itself. Mathematical motivations as well as some results of implementation of the algorithm on artificially generated signals and real EEG signals have been presented.",Human
"Protein splicing is a post-translational autocatalystic excision of internal protein sequence (intein) with the subsequent ligation of the flanking polypeptides (exteins). The high specificity of excision ensured by intein makes it possible to use a phenomenon of protein splicing for the biotechnology purposes. The aim of this work was optimization of obtaining and purification of the recombinant human growth hormone using the protein splicing. It was experimentally demonstrated that the use of modified intein as auto-removal affine marker makes it possible to perform the rapid and cheap isolation of the recombinant protein Hgh. Furthermore, this approach allows to obtain the human growth hormone with native N-terminus, without formyl-metionine. Key words: intein, human growth hormone, protein splicing",Human
"The near-native free energy landscape of protein G is investigated through 0.4 microseconds-long atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. A theoretical and computational framework is used to assess the time-dependence of salient thermodynamical features. While the quasi-harmonic character of the free energy is found to degrade in a few ns, the slow modes display a very mild dependence on the trajectory duration. This property originates from a striking self-similarity of the free energy landscape embodied by the consistency of the principal directions of the local minima, where the system dwells for several ns, and of the virtual jumps connecting them.",Human
"The linear instability of Lotka-Volterra orbits in the homogenous manifold of a two-patch system is analyzed. The origin of these orbits instability in the absence of prey migration is revealed to be the dependence of the angular velocity on the azimuthal angle; in particular, the system desynchronizes at the exit from the slow part of the trajectory. Using this insight, an analogous model of a two coupled oscillator is presented and shown to yield the same type of linear instability. This unables one to incorporate the linear instability within a recently presented general framework that allows for comparison of all known stabilization mechanisms and for simple classification of observed oscillations.",Human
"This work reports a new methodology aimed at describing characteristics of protein structural shapes, and suggests a framework in which to resolve or classify automatically such structures into known families. This new approach to protein structure characterization is based on elements of integral geometry using biologically relevant measurements of shape and considering them on a multi-scale representation which align the proposed methodology to the recently reported ""tube picture"" of a protein structure as a minimal representation model. The method has been applied with good results to a subset of protein structures known to be especially challenging to revert into families, confirming the potential of the proposed method for accurate structure classification.",Human
"Boolean networks with canalizing functions are used to model gene regulatory networks. In order to learn how such networks may behave under evolutionary forces, we simulate the evolution of a single Boolean network by means of an adaptive walk, which allows us to explore the fitness landscape. Mutations change the connections and the functions of the nodes. Our fitness criterion is the robustness of the dynamical attractors against small perturbations. We find that with this fitness criterion the global maximum is always reached and that there is a huge neutral space of 100% fitness. Furthermore, in spite of having such a high degree of robustness, the evolved networks still share many features with ""chaotic"" networks.",Human
"The Laessig-Wiese (LW) field theory for the freezing transition of random RNA secondary structures is generalized to the situation of an external force. We find a second-order phase transition at a critical applied force f = f_c. For f < f_c forces are irrelevant. For f > f_c, the extension L as a function of pulling force f scales as (f-f_c)^(1/gamma-1). The exponent gamma is calculated in an epsilon-expansion: At 1-loop order gamma = epsilon/2 = 1/2, equivalent to the disorder-free case. 2-loop results yielding gamma = 0.6 are briefly mentioned. Using a locking argument, we speculate that this result extends to the strong-disorder phase.",Human
"The Darwinian paradigm of biological evolution is based on the separability of the variation and selection processes. As a result, the population thinking had always been an integral part of the Darwinian approach. I propose an alternative scheme of biological adaptation. It is based on appreciation of limits of what we can observe considering an individual biological object. This leads to a possibility for the adaptation process to occur on the level of a single object, as a 'selection among virtual states of the organism'. I discuss the application of this idea to the phenomenon of adaptive mutations in bacteria.",Human
"All living cells transport molecules and ions across membranes, often against concentration gradients. This active transport requires continual energy expenditure and is clearly a nonequilibrium process for which standard equilibrium thermodynamics is not rigorously applicable. Here we derive a nonequilibrium effective potential that evaluates the per particle transport energy invested by the membrane. A novel method is used whereby a Hamiltonian function is constructed using particle concentrations as generalized coordinates. The associated generalized momenta are simply related to the individual particle energy from which we identify the effective potential. Examples are given and the formalism is compared with the equilibrium Gibb's free energy.",Human
"Biological information processing as implemented by regulatory and signaling networks in living cells requires sufficient specificity of molecular interaction to distinguish signals from one another, but much of regulation and signaling involves somewhat fuzzy and promiscuous recognition of molecular sequences and structures, which can leave systems vulnerable to crosstalk. This paper examines a simple computational model of protein-protein interactions which reveals both a sharp onset of crosstalk and a fragmentation of the neutral network of viable solutions as more proteins compete for regions of sequence space, revealing intrinsic limits to reliable signaling in the face of promiscuity. These results suggest connections to both phase transitions in constraint satisfaction problems and coding theory bounds on the size of communication codes.",Human
The proposed analysis of the currently available experimental results concerning the neural cell activity in the brain area known as hippocampus suggests a particular mechanism of spatial information and memory processing. Below it is argued that the spatial information available through the analysis of the hippocampal cell activity is predominantly of topological nature. It is pointed out that a direct topological analysis can produce a topological invariant based classification of the cell activity patterns and a complete topological description of animal's current environment. It also provides a full first order logical system for local topological reasoning about spatial structure and animal's navigational strategies.,Human
"We investigate the dynamics of an idealized model of microtubule growth that evolves by: (i) attachment of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) at rate lambda, (ii) conversion of GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) at rate 1, and (iii) detachment of GDP at rate mu. As a function of these rates, a microtubule can grow steadily or its length can fluctuate wildly. For mu=0, we find the exact tubule and GTP cap length distributions, and power-law length distributions of GTP and GDP islands. For mu=infinity, we argue that the time between catastrophes, where the microtubule shrinks to zero length, scales as exp(lambda). We also find the phase boundary between a growing and shrinking microtubule.",Human
"We analyse a simple discrete-time stochastic process for the theoretical modeling of the evolution of protein lengths. At every step of the process a new protein is produced as a modification of one of the proteins already existing and its length is assumed to be random variable which depends only on the length of the originating protein. Thus a Random Recursive Trees (RRT) is produced over the natural integers. If (quasi) scale invariance is assumed, the length distribution in a single history tends to a lognormal form with a specific signature of the deviations from exact gaussianity. Comparison with the very large SIMAP protein database shows good agreement.",Human
"In this paper we consider the evolution of the HIV infection under a highly effective treatment based on a combination of RTI and/or PI drugs. This is usually modelled with a set of ODEs where the drug efficacy is a constant. In this paper we consider the treatment efficacy as a dynamic variable which evolves during the treatment. To model the dynamics of the drug efficacy we use an evolutive type assumption. The resulting set of ODEs are able to reproduce the typical pattern of the illness evolution under treatment: a period of remission, which can last several years, followed by a progressive recrudescence and a viral rebound.",Human
"Evolutionary relationships between species are usually represented in phylogenies, i.e. evolutionary trees, which are a type of networks. The terminal nodes of these trees represent species, which are made of individuals and populations among which gene flow occurs. This flow can also be represented as a network. In this paper we briefly show some properties of these complex networks of evolutionary and ecological relationships. First, we characterize large scale evolutionary relationships in the Tree of Life by a degree distribution. Second, we represent genetic relationships between individuals of a Mediterranean marine plant, Posidonia oceanica, in terms of a Minimum Spanning Tree. Finally, relationships among plant shoots inside populations are represented as networks of genetic similarity.",Human
We show that in the dissipative quantum model of brain the time-dependence of the frequencies of the electrical dipole wave quanta leads to the dynamical organization of the memories in space (i.e. to their localization in more or less diffused regions of the brain) and in time (i.e. to their longer or shorter life-time). The life-time and the localization in domains of the memory states also depend on internal parameters and on the number of links that the brain establishes with the external world. These results agree with the physiological observations of the dynamic formation of neural circuitry which grows as brain develops and relates to external world.,Human
"Replication of DNA and synthesis of proteins are studied from the view-point of quantum database search. Identification of a base-pairing with a quantum query gives a natural (and first ever) explanation of why living organisms have 4 nucleotide bases and 20 amino acids. It is amazing that these numbers arise as solutions to an optimisation problem. Components of the DNA structure which implement Grover's algorithm are identified, and a physical scenario is presented for the execution of the quantum algorithm. It is proposed that enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining quantum coherence of the process. Experimental tests that can verify this scenario are pointed out.",Human
"It is a fascinating subject to explore how well we can understand the processes of life on the basis of fundamental laws of physics. It is emphasised that viewing biological processes as manipulation of information extracts their essential features. This information processing can be analysed using well-known methods of computer science. The lowest level of biological information processing, involving DNA and proteins, is the easiest one to link to physical properties. Physical underpinnings of the genetic information that could have led to the universal language of 4 nucleotide bases and 20 amino acids are pointed out. Generalisations of Boolean logic, especially features of quantum dynamics, play a crucial role.",Human
"Based on a calculation of neural decoherence rates, we argue that that the degrees of freedom of the human brain that relate to cognitive processes should be thought of as a classical rather than quantum system, i.e., that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the current classical approach to neural network simulations. We find that the decoherence timescales ~10^{-13}-10^{-20} seconds are typically much shorter than the relevant dynamical timescales (~0.001-0.1 seconds), both for regular neuron firing and for kink-like polarization excitations in microtubules. This conclusion disagrees with suggestions by Penrose and others that the brain acts as a quantum computer, and that quantum coherence is related to consciousness in a fundamental way.",Human
"The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.",Human
"An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation theory of fluids are briefly addressed.",Human
"We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum. The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several experimental tests in such optical systems.",Human
"We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit.",Human
"We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.",Human
"Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Law constitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the rest frame of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used to demonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of the measured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: `proper', `improper' and `apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic time dilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications. A non-intuitive `length expansion' effect predicted by the Reciprocity Principle as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out",Human
"Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the corresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability) so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.",Human
"Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns can be inferred from computer databases of published papers. The genetic programming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP\@. In addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation reveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in other scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central network component and a high clustering.",Human
"We report on a new type of experiment that enables us to monitor spatially and temporally heterogeneous dynamic properties in complex fluids. Our approach is based on the analysis of near-field speckles produced by light diffusely reflected from the superficial volume of a strongly scattering medium. By periodic modulation of an incident speckle beam we obtain pixel-wise ensemble averages of the structure function coefficient, a measure of the dynamic activity. To illustrate the application of our approach we follow the different stages in the drying process of a colloidal thin film. We show that we can access ensemble averaged dynamic properties on length scales as small as ten micrometers over the full field of view.",Human
When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation is rotated. Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the transmitted image (Padgett et al. 2006). We examine these two phenomena by extending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating medium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular momentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of the transmitted image.,Human
"We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this view we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges (1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.",Human
"Extensions of statistical mechanics are routinely being used to infer free energies from the work performed over single-molecule nonequilibrium trajectories. A key element of this approach is the ubiquitous expression dW/dt=\partial H(x,t)/ \partial t which connects the microscopic work W performed by a time-dependent force on the coordinate x with the corresponding Hamiltonian H(x,t) at time t. Here we show that this connection, as pivotal as it is, cannot be used to estimate free energy changes. We discuss the implications of this result for single-molecule experiments and atomistic molecular simulations and point out possible avenues to overcome these limitations.",Human
"Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass, approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise, however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems, independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.",Human
"Mechanisms of whispering-gallery (WG) modes coupling in microdisk photonic molecules (PMs) with slight and significant size mismatch are numerically investigated. The results reveal two different scenarios of modes interaction depending on the degree of this mismatch and offer new insight into how PM parameters can be tuned to control and modify WG-modes wavelengths and Q-factors. From a practical point of view, these findings offer a way to fabricate PM microlaser structures that exhibit low thresholds and directional emission, and at the same time are more tolerant to fabrication errors than previously explored coupled-cavity structures composed of identical microresonators.",Human
"A new single-particle shell model is derived by solving the Schr\""odinger equation for a semi-spheroidal potential well. Only the negative parity states of the $Z(z)$ component of the wave function are allowed, so that new magic numbers are obtained for oblate semi-spheroids, semi-sphere and prolate semi-spheroids. The semi-spherical magic numbers are identical with those obtained at the oblate spheroidal superdeformed shape: 2, 6, 14, 26, 44, 68, 100, 140, ... The superdeformed prolate magic numbers of the semi-spheroidal shape are identical with those obtained at the spherical shape of the spheroidal harmonic oscillator: 2, 8, 20, 40, 70, 112, 168 ...",Human
"The intercombination line of Strontium at 689nm is successfully used in laser cooling to reach the photon recoil limit with Doppler cooling in a magneto-optical traps (MOT). In this paper we present a systematic study of the loading efficiency of such a MOT. Comparing the experimental results to a simple model allows us to discuss the actual limitation of our apparatus. We also study in detail the final MOT regime emphasizing the role of gravity on the position, size and temperature along the vertical and horizontal directions. At large laser detuning, one finds an unusual situation where cooling and trapping occur in the presence of a high bias magnetic field.",Human
"Analysis of electromagnetic planewave propagation in a medium which is a spatiotemporally homogeneous, temporally nonlocal, isotropic, chiral medium in a co-moving frame of reference shows that the medium is both spatially and temporally nonlocal with respect to all non-co-moving inertial frames of reference. Using the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields, we show that plane waves which have positive phase velocity in the co-moving frame of reference can have negative phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames of reference. Similarly, plane waves which have negative phase velocity in the co-moving frame can have positive phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames.",Human
"I discuss several aspects of information theory and its relationship to physics and neuroscience. The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity, for short). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin (algorithmic) Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on the observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.",Human
"The subject of collective attention is central to an information age where millions of people are inundated with daily messages. It is thus of interest to understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among one million users of an interactive website -- \texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law, suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.",Human
"A cylindrical wave expansion method is developed to obtain the scattering field for an ideal two-dimensional cylindrical invisibility cloak. A near-ideal model of the invisibility cloak is set up to solve the boundary problem at the inner boundary of the cloak shell. We confirm that a cloak with the ideal material parameters is a perfect invisibility cloak by systematically studying the change of the scattering coefficients from the near-ideal case to the ideal one. However, due to the slow convergence of the zero$^{th}$ order scattering coefficients, a tiny perturbation on the cloak would induce a noticeable field scattering and penetration.",Human
"This paper introduces a theory about the role of language in learning physics. The theory is developed in the context of physics students' and physicists' talking and writing about the subject of quantum mechanics. We found that physicists' language encodes different varieties of analogical models through the use of grammar and conceptual metaphor. We hypothesize that students categorize concepts into ontological categories based on the grammatical structure of physicists' language. We also hypothesize that students over-extend and misapply conceptual metaphors in physicists' speech and writing. Using our theory, we will show how, in some cases, we can explain student difficulties in quantum mechanics as difficulties with language.",Human
"In this paper, we consider daily financial data of a collection of different stock market indices, exchange rates, and interest rates, and we analyze their multi-scaling properties by estimating a simple specification of the Markov-switching multifractal model (MSM). In order to see how well the estimated models capture the temporal dependence of the data, we estimate and compare the scaling exponents $H(q)$ (for $q = 1, 2$) for both empirical data and simulated data of the estimated MSM models. In most cases the multifractal model appears to generate `apparent' long memory in agreement with the empirical scaling laws.",Human
"An accurate experimental investigation on the Mpemba effect (that is, the freezing of initially hot water before cold one) is carried out, showing that in the adiabatic cooling of water a relevant role is played by supercooling as well as by phase transitions taking place at 6 +/- 1 oC, 3.5 +/- 0.5 oC and 1.3 +/- 0.6 oC, respectively. The last transition, occurring with a non negligible probability of 0.21, has not been detected earlier. Supported by the experimental results achieved, a thorough theoretical analysis of supercooling and such phase transitions, which are interpreted in terms of different ordering of clusters of molecules in water, is given.",Human
"We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional entanglement.",Human
"Retarded electromagnetic potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and the Lorenz condition. The difference found between these potentials and the conventional Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert ones is explained by neglect, for the latter, of the motion-dependence of the effective charge density. The corresponding retarded fields of a point-like charge in arbitary motion are compared with those given by the formulae of Heaviside, Feynman, Jefimenko and other authors. The fields of an accelerated charge given by the Feynman are the same as those derived from the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials but not those given by the Jefimenko formulae. A mathematical error concerning partial space and time derivatives in the derivation of the Jefimenko equations is pointed out.",Human
"We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.",Human
"The design, construction, and performance of a linear radio-frequency ion trap (RFQ) intended for use in the Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) are described. EXO aims to detect the neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe to $^{136}$Ba. To suppress possible backgrounds EXO will complement the measurement of decay energy and, to some extent, topology of candidate events in a Xe filled detector with the identification of the daughter nucleus ($^{136}$Ba). The ion trap described here is capable of accepting, cooling, and confining individual Ba ions extracted from the site of the candidate double-beta decay event. A single trapped ion can then be identified, with a large signal-to-noise ratio, via laser spectroscopy.",Human
"Many real systems possess accelerating statistics where the total number of edges grows faster than the network size. In this paper, we propose a simple weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks. Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical simulations.",Human
"We develop a class of soliton solution of {\it linear} Schr\""odinger equation without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum probability density. We further show that the linearity of the Schr\""odinger equation allows us to have non-interacting many solitons solution through superposition, each describing a particle with equal mass.",Human
"As networks and their structure have become a major field of research, a strong demand for network visualization has emerged. We address this challenge by formalizing the well established spring layout in terms of dynamic equations. We thus open up the design space for new algorithms. Drawing from the knowledge of systems design, we derive a layout algorithm that remedies several drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on the balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\em arf} for ""attractive and repulsive forces"". It is, as we claim, particularly suited for a dynamic layout of smaller networks ($n < 10^3$). We back this claim with several application examples from on going complex systems research.",Human
"Axisymmetric equilibria with incompressible flows of arbitrary direction are studied in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics under a variety of physically relevant side conditions. To this end a set of pertinent non-linear ODEs are transformed to quasilinear ones and the respective initial value problem is solved numerically with appropriately determined initial values near the magnetic axis. Several equilibria are then constructed surface by surface. The non field aligned flow results in novel configurations with a single magnetic axis, toroidal shell configurations in which the plasma is confined within a couple of magnetic surfaces and double shell-like configurations. In addition, the flow affects the elongation and triangularity of the magnetic surfaces.",Human
In the present letter we suggest a new theoretical model for a quantitative description of the magnetoreception mechanism in birds. The considered mechanism involves two types of iron minerals (magnetite and maghemite) which were found in subcellular compartments within sensory dendrites of the upper beak of several bird species. The analysis of forces acting between the iron particles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can significantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels opening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the suggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer providing an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.,Human
"Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square, pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take into account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental and numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation of long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the two-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with micro-disks.",Human
"Starting from the governing equations for a quantum magnetoplasma including the quantum Bohm potential and electron spin-1/2 effects, we show that the system of quantum magnetohydrodynamic (QMHD) equations admit rarefactive solitons due to the balance between nonlinearities and quantum diffraction/tunneling effects. It is found that the electron spin-1/2 effect introduces a pressure-like term with negative sign in the QMHD equations, which modifies the shape of the solitary magnetosonic waves and makes them wider and shallower. Numerical simulations of the time-dependent system shows the development of rarefactive QMHD solitary waves that are modified by the spin effects.",Human
The principal limits for the accuracy of the resonance frequency measurements set by the asymmetry of the natural resonance line shape are studied and applied to the recent accurate frequency measurements in the two-photon 1s-2s resonance and in the one-photon 1s-2p resonance in hydrogen atom. This limit for 1s-2s resonance is found to be $\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz compared to the accuracy achieved in experiment $\pm 46$ Hz. In case of deuterium atom the limit is essentially larger: $10^{-2}$ Hz. For 1s-2p resonance the accuracy limit is 0.17 MHz while the uncertainty of the recent frequency measurement is about 6 MHz.,Human
"We study semi-analytically and in a consistent manner, the generation of a mean velocity field $\bar{\mathbf{U}}$ by helical MHD turbulence, and the effect that this field can have on a Mean Field Dynamo. Assuming a prescribed, maximally helical small scale velocity field, we show that large scale flows can be generated in MHD turbulent flows, via small scale Lorentz force. These flows back-react on the mean electromotive force of a Mean Field Dynamo through new terms, leaving the original $\alpha $ and $\beta $ terms explicitly unmodified. Cross-helicity plays the key role in interconnecting all the effects. In the minimal $\tau$ closure that we chose to work with, the effects are stronger for large relaxation times.",Human
"We show in spatially one dimensional Madelung fluid that a simple requirement on local stability of the maximum of quantum probability density will, if combined with the global scale invariance of quantum potential, lead to a class of quantum probability densities globally being self-trapped by their own self-generated quantum potentials, possessing only a finite-size spatial support. It turns out to belong to a class of the most probable wave function given its energy through the maximum entropy principle. We proceed to show that there is a limiting case in which the quantum probability density becomes the stationary-moving soliton-like solution of the Schr\""odinger equation.",Human
"In this work, we study the size of the particles involved in a powder snow avalanche phenomenon. To determine these sizes, we study all the phenomena the particles have to face before arriving in the ""body"" of the avalanche. We study the boundary layer which is at the bottom of the avalanche. We determine, with the help of experimental data, the range of size of the particles that can be entrained by the avalanche. We then examine the possibility for these particles to reach the top of the boundary layer, and so to take part in the avalanche. Our final result is that the more frequent particles suspended in a powder snow avalanche have a size lower than 200 micrometers.",Human
"In this work, we consider several types of lubricants - including non-Newtonian fluids - that were studied under various operating conditions leading us to explore a wide range of dimensionless parameters. The experimental results are compared with predictions given by the usual analytical EHL relationships and by more recently developed models. This broad comparison conducted with particular emphasis on minimum film thickness (hm) showed a fair agreement between experimental data and a few predictions including some obtained from extended models. Commonly used elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) models did not systematically gave accurate hm estimation, whereas minimum film thickness not only is a yield value but also serves as a key parameter in estimating lubrication regimes.",Human
"Solid state lasers are demanding independent control in the gain media and cavity loss to achieve ultra short laser pulses using passive mode-locking. Recently, laser mode-locking is achieved with a MBE structure with multiple quantum wells, designed to achieve two functions; Bragg mirror and changes in absorption to control the cavity dynamics. The use of an AlGaAs/AlAs Bragg mirror with a 15 nm GaAs saturable absorber used in a Cr:LiSAF tuneable laser proved to be effective to produce femtosecond pulses. The use of saturable absorbers thus far is a trial and error procedure that is changing due to the correlation with more predictive procedures.",Human
"We study the energy deposition by light and heavy nuclei in tissue-like media as used for cancer therapy. The depth-dose distributions for protons, $^{3}$He, $^{12}$C, $^{20}$Ne, and $^{58}$Ni nuclei are calculated within a Monte Carlo model based on the GEANT4 toolkit. These distributions are compared with each other and with available experimental data. It is demonstrated that nuclear fragmentation reactions essentially reduce the peak-to-plateau ratio of the dose profiles for deeply penetrating energetic ions heavier than $^{3}$He. On the other hand, all projectiles up to $^{20}$Ne were found equally suitable for therapeutic use at low penetration depths.",Human
"We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent. We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with composite decisions.",Human
"The nature of non-exponential kinetics in microbial cells inactivation by pulsed electric fields (PEF) is discussed. It was demonstrated that possible mechanism of non-exponential kinetics can be related to orientational disorder in suspension of microbial cells of anisotropic form. A numerical studies of spheroidal cell suspensions was carried out. The most pronounced deviations from the exponential kinetics were observed for disordered suspensions of prolate spheroids at small electric field strength $E$ or at large aspect ratio $a$. For partially oriented suspensions, efficiency of inactivation enhances with increasing of order parameter and field strength. A possibility of the PEF-induced orientational ordering in microbial suspensions is discussed.",Human
"Parametric instabilities driven by partially coherent radiation in plasmas are described by a generalized statistical Wigner-Moyal set of equations, formally equivalent to the full wave equation, coupled to the plasma fluid equations. A generalized dispersion relation for Stimulated Raman Scattering driven by a partially coherent pump field is derived, revealing a growth rate dependence, with the coherence width $\sigma$ of the radiation field, scaling with $1/\sigma$ for backscattering (three-wave process), and with $1/\sigma^{1/2}$ for direct forward scattering (four-wave process). Our results demonstrate the possibility to control the growth rates of these instabilities by properly using broadband pump radiation fields.",Human
"This letter presents principles and applications of a virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier that is a simple but effective method to recover small ac signal from noise with high presison. The fundamentals of this method are based on calculation of cross-correlation function. Via this method, we successfully built up a magnetoelectric measurement system which can perform precise and versatile measurements without any analog lock-in amplifier. Using the virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier, the output of the magnetoelectric measurement system is extensively rich in magnetoelectric coupling behaviors, including coupling strength and phase lag, under various dc bias magnetic field and ac magnetic field.",Human
"We consider the stability of a porous medium submitted to a steady-state flow with free-boundary. Assuming some hypotheses, it is possible to implement the kinematic method by using an approximate pressure field bounding the true pressure field from below. We are interested in finding such approximate pressure fields and in proving that they bound the true pressure field from below without knowing the true pressure field. We use fields which are solutions of a problem with relaxed conditions with regard to the real problem. Under a uniqueness condition of the solution of a weak formulation of the problem, such fields are lower bounds for the true pressure field. Finally, we give the example of a vertical dam.",Human
"A specific, genuinely three-dimensional mechanism of rogue wave formation, in a late stage of the modulational instability of a perturbed Stokes deep-water wave, is recognized through numerical experiments. The simulations are based on fully nonlinear equations describing weakly three-dimensional potential flows of an ideal fluid with a free surface in terms of conformal variables. Spontaneous formation of zigzag patterns for wave amplitude is observed in a nonlinear stage of the instability. If initial wave steepness is sufficiently high ($ka>0.06$), these coherent structures produce rogue waves. The most tall waves appear in ``turns'' of the zigzags. For $ka<0.06$, the structures decay typically without formation of steep waves.",Human
"Forward time step integrators are splitting algorithms with only positive splitting coefficients. When used in solving physical evolution equations, these positive coefficients correspond to positive time steps. Forward algorithms are essential for solving time-irreversible equations that cannot be evolved using backward time steps. However, forward integrators are also better in solving time-reversible equations of classical dynamics by tracking as closely as possible the physical trajectory. This work compares in detail various forward and non-forward fourth-order integrators using three, fourth, five and six force evaluations. In the case of solving the 2D Kepler orbit, all non-forward integrators are optimized by simply minimizing the size of their backward time steps.",Human
"Some arguments in favour of the existence of tachyons and extensions of the Lorentz Group are presented. On the former, it is observed that with a slight modification to standard electromagnetic theory a single superluminal charge will bind to itself in a self-sustaining circular orbit, suggestive of a (modified) electromagnetic interpretation of the strong force. Symmetries in that theory are used in the subsequent analysis as a starting point in the search for physically-motivated extensions of the Lorentz Group. There is some discussion of the validity of imaginary coordinates in superluminal transformations of frame. The article concludes with some speculation on the implications for faster-than light travel.",Human
"Several theories for weakly damped free-surface flows have been formulated. In this paper we use the linear approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations to derive a new set of equations for potential flow which include dissipation due to viscosity. A viscous correction is added not only to the irrotational pressure (Bernoulli's equation), but also to the kinematic boundary condition. The nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation that one can derive from the new set of equations to describe the modulations of weakly nonlinear, weakly damped deep-water gravity waves turns out to be the classical damped version of the NLS equation that has been used by many authors without rigorous justification.",Human
"In analogy with the load and the metage in hydrodynamics, we define magnetohydrodynamic load and magnetohydrodynamic metage in the case of magnetofluids. They can be used to write the magnetic field in MHD in Clebsch's form. We show how these two concepts can be utilised to derive the magnetic analogue of the Ertel's theorem and also, how in the presence of non-trivial topology of the magnetic field in the magnetofluid one may associate the linking number of the magnetic field lines with the invariant MHD loads. The paper illustrates that the symmetry translation of the MHD metage in the corresponding label space generates the conservation of cross helicity.",Human
"We derive an approach to define the causal direction of the wavevector of modes in optical metamaterials, which in turn, determines signs of refractive index and impedance as a function of {\it real and imaginary} parts of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. We use the developed technique to demonstrate that the interplay between resonant response of constituents of metamaterials can be used to achieve efficient dispersion management. Finally we demonstrate broadband dispersion-less index and impedance matching in active nanowire-based negative index materials. Our work opens new practical applications of negative index composites for broadband lensing, imaging, and pulse-routing.",Human
"In this paper we review the applicability of autofluorescent proteins for single-molecule imaging in biology. The photophysical characteristics of several mutants of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and those of DsRed are compared and critically discussed for their use in cellular biology. The alternative use of two-photon excitation at the single-molecule level or Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy is envisaged for the study of individual autofluorescent proteins. Single-molecule experiments performed in live cells using eGFP and preferably eYFP fusion proteins are reviewed. Finally, the first use at the single-molecule level of citrine, a more photostable variant of the eYFP is reported when fused to a receptor for neurotransmitter in live cells.",Human
"Schroedinger's book 'What is Life?' is widely credited for having played a crucial role in development of molecular and cellular biology. My essay revisits the issues raised by this book from the modern perspective of epigenetics and systems biology. I contrast two classes of potential mechanisms of epigenetic stability: 'epigenetic templating' and 'systems biology' approaches, and consider them from the point of view expressed by Schroedinger. I also discuss how quantum entanglement, a nonclassical feature of quantum mechanics, can help to address the 'problem of small numbers' that lead Schroedinger to promote the idea of molecular code-script for explanation of stability of biological order.",Human
"We present a formalism of x-ray dynamical diffraction from volume diffractive optics with large numerical aperture and high aspect ratio, in an analogy to the Takagi-Taupin equations for strained single crystals. We derive a set of basic equations for dynamical diffraction from volume diffractive optics, which enable us to study the focusing property of these optics with various grating profiles. We study volume diffractive optics that satisfy the Bragg condition to various degrees, namely flat, tilted and wedged geometries, and derive the curved geometries required for ultimate focusing. We show that the curved geometries satisfy the Bragg condition everywhere and phase requirement for point focusing, and effectively focus hard x-rays to a scale close to the wavelength.",Human
We investigate the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge moving along a helical trajectory inside a circular waveguide with conducting walls filled by homogeneous dielectric. The parts corresponding to the radiation field are separated and the formulae for the radiation intensity are derived for both TE and TM waves. It is shown that the main part of the radiated quanta is emitted in the form of the TE waves. Various limiting cases are considered. The results of the numerical calculations show that the insertion of the waveguide provides an additional mechanism for tuning the characteristics of the emitted radiation by choosing the parameters of the waveguide and filling medium.,Human
"In this Letter, we proposed a mixing navigation mechanism, which interpolates between random-walk and shortest-path protocol. The navigation efficiency can be remarkably enhanced via a few routers. Some advanced strategies are also designed: For non-geographical scale-free networks, the targeted strategy with a tiny fraction of routers can guarantee an efficient navigation with low and stable delivery time almost independent of network size. For geographical localized networks, the clustering strategy can simultaneously increase the efficiency and reduce the communication cost. The present mixing navigation mechanism is of significance especially for information organization of wireless sensor networks and distributed autonomous robotic systems.",Human
"We find actual evidence, relying upon vorticity time series taken in a high Reynolds number atmospheric experiment, that to a very good approximation the surface boundary layer flow may be described, in a statistical sense and under certain regimes, as an advected ensemble of homogeneous turbulent systems, characterized by a lognormal distribution of fluctuating intensities. Our analysis suggests that usual direct numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, performed at moderate Reynolds numbers, may play an important role in the study of turbulent boundary layer flows, if supplemented with appropriate statistical information concerned with the structure of large scale fluctuations.",Human
"We present an one-dimensional particle-in-cell Monte-Carlo model for capacitively coupled radio-frequency discharges in oxygen. The model quantitatively describes the central part of the discharge. For a given voltage and pressure, it self-consistently determines the electric potential and the distribution functions for electrons, negatively charged atomic oxygen, and positively charged molecular oxygen. Previously used collision cross sections are critically assessed and in some cases modified. Provided associative detachment due to metastable oxygen molecules is included in the model, the electro-negativities in the center of the discharge are in excellent agreement with experiments. Due to lack of empirical data for the cross section of this process, we propose a simple model and discuss its limitations.",Human
The feasibility of chalcogenide rib waveguides working at lambda = 10.6 microns has been demonstrated. The waveguides comprised a several microns thick Te2As3Se5 film deposited by thermal evaporation on a polished As2S3 glass substrate and further etched by physical etching in Ar or CF4/O2 atmosphere. Output images at 10.6 microns and some propagation losses roughly estimated at 10dB/cm proved that the obtained structures behaved as channel waveguides with a good lateral confinement of the light. The work opens the doors to the realisation of components able to work in the mid and thermal infrared up to 20 microns and even more.,Human
"The Navier-Stokes equations and magnetohydrodynamics equations are written in terms of poloidal and toroidal potentials in a finite cylinder. This formulation insures that the velocity and magnetic fields are divergence-free by construction, but leads to systems of partial differential equations of higher order, whose boundary conditions are coupled. The influence matrix technique is used to transform these systems into decoupled parabolic and elliptic problems. The magnetic field in the induction equation is matched to that in an exterior vacuum by means of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping, thus eliminating the need to discretize the exterior. The influence matrix is scaled in order to attain an acceptable condition number.",Human
"Two-photon decay rates in simple atoms such as hydrogenlike systems represent rather interesting fundamental problems in atomic physics. The sum of the energies of the two emitted photons has to fulfill an energy conservation condition, the decay takes place via intermediate virtual states, and the total decay rate is obtained after an integration over the energy of one of the emitted photons. Here, we investigate cases with a virtual state having an energy intermediate between the initial and the final state of the decay process, and we show that due to non-uniform convergence, only a careful treatment of the singularities infinitesimally displaced from the photon integration contour leads to consistent and convergent results.",Human
"The refractive index of a dielectric medium comprising both passive and inverted components in its permittivity was determined using two methods: (i) in the time domain, a finite-difference algorithm to compute the frequency-domain reflectance from reflection data for a pulsed plane wave that is normally incident on a dielectric half-space, and (ii) in the frequency domain, the deflection of an obliquely incident Gaussian beam on transmission through a dielectric slab. The dielectric medium was found to be an active medium with a negative real part for its refractive index. Thereby, a recent controversy in the scientific literature was resolved.",Human
"Sensitivity to temporal variation of the fundamental constants may be strongly enhanced in transitions between narrow close levels of different nature. This enhancement may be realized in a large number of molecules due to cancelation between the ground state fine structure omega_f and vibrational interval omega_v (omega=omega_f - n omega_v is close to zero, delta omega/omega= K (2 delta alpha/alpha +0.5 delta mu/mu), K >>1, mu=m_p/m_e).   The intervals between the levels are conveniently located in microwave frequency range and the level widths are very small. Required accuracy of the shift measurements is about 0.01-1 Hz. As examples, we consider molecules Cl_2+, CuS, IrC, SiBr and HfF+.",Human
"Actual organizations, in particular the ones which operate in evolving and distributed environments, need advanced frameworks for the management of the knowledge life cycle. These systems have to be based on the social relations which constitute the pattern of collaboration ties of the organization. We demonstrate here, with the aid of a model taken from the theory of graphs, that it is possible to provide the conditions for an effective knowledge management. A right way could be to involve the actors with the highest betweeness centrality in the generation of discussion groups. This solution allows the externalization of tacit knowledge, the preservation of knowledge and the raise of innovation processes.",Human
"Path integral Monte Carlo approach is used to study the coupled quantum dynamics of the electron and nuclei in hydrogen molecule ion. The coupling effects are demonstrated by comparing differences in adiabatic Born--Oppenheimer and non-adiabatic simulations, and inspecting projections of the full three-body dynamics onto adiabatic Born--Oppenheimer approximation.   Coupling of electron and nuclear quantum dynamics is clearly seen. Nuclear pair correlation function is found to broaden by 0.040 a_0 and average bond length is larger by 0.056 a_0. Also, non-adiabatic correction to the binding energy is found. Electronic distribution is affected less, and therefore, we could say that the adiabatic approximation is better for the electron than for the nuclei.",Human
"We apply the mathematical technique of factorization of differential operators to two different problems. First we review our results related to the supersymmetry of the Montroll kinks moving onto the microtubule walls as well as mentioning the sine-Gordon model for the microtubule nonlinear excitations. Second, we find analytic expressions for a class of one-parameter solutions of a sort of diffusion equation of Bessel type that is obtained by supersymmetry from the homogeneous form of a simple damped wave equations derived in the works of P.A. Robinson and collaborators for the corticothalamic system. We also present a possible interpretation of the diffusion equation in the brain context",Human
"A bent crystal shield which is capable of deflecting cosmic radiation ions of all atomic numbers away from spacecraft using the ion channeling effect is described. Its effect on the transmitted angular distribution of heavy, high-energy ions is characterized using Monte Carlo channeling simulations. Ions up to an energy limit set by the bent crystal curvature radius are deflected by the full curvature angle. A bent crystal shield with a 1 x 1 cm2 surface area capable of deflecting such ions with energies up to 100 GeV/nucleon is fabricated in which the lattice planes across the entrance surface are uniformly aligned.",Human
"A computational model study for complete frequency redistribution linear incoherent two-level atomic radiation trapping in optically dense media using the multiple scattering representation is presented. This model study discuss at length the influence of the spectral distributions, overall opacity and emission quantum yield to trapping distorted ensemble quantities stressing physical insight and with a non-specialist audience in mind. Macroscopic reemission yield, lifetime, steady state spectra and spatial distributions are calculated as a function of intrinsic emission yield, opacity and external excitation mode for Doppler, Lorentz and Voigt lineshapes. The work could constitute the basis for a final undergraduate or beginning graduate project in computational physics instruction and implements the analytical developments of the previous instalment of this contribution.",Human
"We present a method of transferring a cold atom between spatially separated microtraps by means of a Raman transition between the ground motional states of the two traps. The intermediate states for the Raman transition are the vibrational levels of a third microtrap, and we determine the experimental conditions for which the overlap of the wave functions leads to an efficient transfer. There is a close analogy with the Franck-Condon principle in the spectroscopy of molecules. Spin-dependent manipulation of neutral atoms in microtraps has important applications in quantum information processing. We also show that starting with several atoms, precisely one atom can be transferred to the final potential well hence giving deterministic preparation of single atoms.",Human
"Theory of monochromatic wave field amplification in a waveguide array based on expansion of the wave field in terms of guided array modes is developed. Equations for the expansion coefficients include cross-modal gain, which completely changes behavior of the amplified wave field. Analysis of two-mode amplification reveals new unusual features in characteristics of two-mode amplifier. Instead of unlimited growth of both modes for incoherent fields, one of the modes grows with no limit and suppresses the lower-power mode. Effects associated with the cross-modal gain are illustrated analytically on a system of two thin parallel planar waveguides. Conditions are found when a mode with lower gain can become the dominant one at the output of amplifier.",Human
It is shown how to model weakly dissipative free-surface flows using the classical potential flow approach. The Helmholtz-Leray decomposition is applied to the linearized 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations are treated using Fourier--Laplace transforms. We show how to express the vortical component of the velocity only in terms of the potential and free-surface elevation. A new predominant nonlocal viscous term is derived in the bottom kinematic boundary condition. The resulting formulation is simple and does not involve any correction procedure as in previous viscous potential flow theories [Joseph2004]. Corresponding long wave model equations are derived.,Human
An improved method for the description of hierarchical complex systems by means of a Fokker-Planck equation is presented. In particular the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm for constraint problems (L-BFGS-B) is used to minimize the distance between the numerical solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation and the empirical probability density functions and thus to estimate properly the drift and diffusion term of the Fokker-Planck equation. The optimisation routine is applied to a time series of velocity measurements obtained from a turbulent helium gas jet in order to demonstrate the benefits and to quantify the improvements of this new optimisation routine.,Human
"We report the fast accumulation of a large number of metastable 52Cr atoms in a mixed trap, formed by the superposition of a strongly confining optical trap and a quadrupolar magnetic trap. The steady state is reached after about 400 ms, providing a cloud of more than one million metastable atoms at a temperature of about 100 microK, with a peak density of 10^{18} atoms.m^{-3}. We have optimized the loading procedure, and measured the light shift of the 5D4 state by analyzing how the trapped atoms respond to a parametric excitation. We compare this result to a theoretical evaluation based on the available spectroscopic data for chromium atoms.",Human
"We describe a general framework for avoiding spurious eigenvalues -- unphysical unstable eigenvalues that often occur in hydrodynamic stability problems. In two example problems, we show that when system stability is analyzed numerically using {\em descriptor} notation, spurious eigenvalues are eliminated. Descriptor notation is a generalized eigenvalue formulation for differential-algebraic equations that explicitly retains algebraic constraints. We propose that spurious eigenvalues are likely to occur when algebraic constraints are used to analytically reduce the number of independent variables in a differential-algebraic system of equations before the system is approximated numerically. In contrast, the simple and easily generalizable descriptor framework simultaneously solves the differential equations and algebraic constraints and is well-suited to stability analysis in these systems.",Human
"Extracting understanding from the growing ``sea'' of biological and socio-economic data is one of the most pressing scientific challenges facing us. Here, we introduce and validate an unsupervised method that is able to accurately extract the hierarchical organization of complex biological, social, and technological networks. We define an ensemble of hierarchically nested random graphs, which we use to validate the method. We then apply our method to real-world networks, including the air-transportation network, an electronic circuit, an email exchange network, and metabolic networks. We find that our method enables us to obtain an accurate multi-scale descriptions of a complex system.",Human
"Time evolution of the cities and of the languages is considered in terms of multiplicative noise and fragmentation processes; where power law (Pareto-Zipf law) and slightly asymmetric log-normal (Gauss) distribution result for the size distribution of the cities and for that of the languages, respectively. The cities and the languages are treated differently (and as connected; for example, the languages split in terms of splitting the cities, etc.) and thus two distributions are obtained in the same computation at the same time. Evolutions of lifetimes and families for the cities and the languages are also studied. We suggest that the regularities may be evolving out of randomness, in terms of the relevant processes.",Human
"We remind the reader that it is possible to tell if two or more eigenvalues of a matrix are equal, without calculating the eigenvalues. We then use this property to detect (avoided) crossings in the spectra of quantum Hamiltonians representable by matrices. This approach provides a pedagogical introduction to (avoided) crossings, is capable of handling realistic Hamiltonians analytically, and offers a way to visualize crossings which is sometimes superior to that provided by the spectrum. We illustrate the method using the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian to describe the hyperfine-Zeeman structure of the ground state hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field.",Human
"This paper presents simulations of the trajectories of high-energy ions through several bent crystal layers. At certain layer alignments volume reflection occurs from each layer and the resultant multiple volume reflection angle is correspondingly increased, along with the range of entrance angles over which ions undergo volume reflection. Another feature is that the range of entrance angles for which bent crystal channeling occurs is also increased in passing through several bent layers. The use of several bent crystal layers to produce multiple volume reflection provides an alternative approach to the design of a space shield or radiation protection at accelerators based on bent crystals.",Human
"We report laser emission from single, stationary, Rhodamine B-doped glycerol/water microdroplets located on a superhydrophobic surface. In the experiments, a pulsed, frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm was used as the excitation source. The microdroplets ranged in diameter from a few to 20 um. Lasing was achieved in the red-shifted portion of the dye emission spectrum with threshold fluences as low as 750 J/cm2. Photobleaching was observed when the microdroplets were pumped above threshold. In certain cases, multimode lasing was also observed and attributed to the simultaneous lasing of two modes belonging to different sets of whispering gallery modes.",Human
"The paper explores the use of nanoparticles of gamma Fe2O3 for hyperthermia treatment of living organisms by absorption of 1064 nm radiations from Nd:YAG laser. Escherichia coli cells have been used as the model system for demonstrating the effect wherein lysine is used as an interface between the cell walls and the nanoparticles. Scanning Electron Microscopic observations have, exclusively, proved that attachment of nanoparticles of iron oxide along with lysine alone is responsible for absorption of above radiations. The quantitative estimation has been provided by growth rate measurements and protein assessment of the cells. The nanoparticles of gamma Fe2O3 were synthesized by DC arc plasma assisted gas phase condensation.",Human
"We address the role of community structure of an interaction network in ordering dynamics, as well as associated forms of metastability. We consider the voter and AB model dynamics in a network model which mimics social interactions. The AB model includes an intermediate state between the two excluding options of the voter model. For the voter model we find dynamical metastable disordered states with a characteristic mean lifetime. However, for the AB dynamics we find a power law distribution of the lifetime of metastable states, so that the mean lifetime is not representative of the dynamics. These trapped metastable states, which can order at all time scales, originate in the mesoscopic network structure.",Human
"In a static gravitational field an intersection of a worldline by a global hypersurface of simultaneity t=const gives an invariant constraint relating the proper time of this event by t. Since at any finite t the such constrained proper time intervals are less than reqiured for crossing a horizon, general relativity predicts the gravitational freezing of proper times in stars with time-like or null geodesics everywhere. The time dilation stabilizes contracting massive stars by freezing, which is maximal but finite at the centre, and the surface is frozen near the gravitational radius. The frozen stars (frozars) slowly defrost due to emissions and external interactions, the internal phase transitions can initiate refreezing with bursts and explosions.",Human
"In this work linear stability analysis of a four-fluid optically thin plasma consisting of electrons, ions, neutral atoms, and charged dust particles is performed with respect to the radiation-condensation (RC) instability. The energy budget of the plasma involves the input from heating through photo-electron emission by dust particles under external ultraviolet radiation as well as radiative losses in inelastic electron-neutral, electron-ion, neutral-neutral collisions. It is shown that negatively charged particles stimulate the RC instability in the sense that the conditions for the instability to hold are wider than similar conditions in a single-fluid description.",Human
Time-of-flight (TOF) cameras are based on a new technology that delivers distance maps by the use of a modulated light source. In this paper we first describe a set of experiments that we performed with TOF cameras. We then propose a noise model which is able to explain some of the phenomena observed in the experiments. The model is based on assuming a noise source that is correlated with the light source (shot noise) and an additional additive noise source (dark current noise). The model predicts well the dependency of the distance errors on the image intensity and the true distance at an individual pixel.,Human
"Forest-fire waiting times, defined as the time between successive events above a certain size in a given region, are calculated for Italy. The probability densities of the waiting times are found to verify a scaling law, despite that fact that the distribution of fire sizes is not a power law. The meaning of such behavior in terms of the possible self-similarity of the process in a nonstationary system is discussed. We find that the scaling law arises as a consequence of the stationarity of fire sizes and the existence of a non-trivial ``instantaneous'' scaling law, sustained by the correlations of the process.",Human
"The three-dimensional instability of two coupled electromagnetic waves in an unmagnetized plasma is investigated theoretically and numerically. In the regime of two-plasmon decay, where one pump wave frequency is approximately twice the electron plasma frequency, we find that the coupled pump waves give rise to enhanced instability with wave vectors between those of the two beams. In the case of ion parametric decay instability, where the pump wave decays into one Langmuir wave and one ion acoustic wave, the instability regions are added with no distinct amplification. Our investigation can be useful in interpreting laser-plasma as well as ionospheric heating experiments.",Human
"NASA has claimed the discovery of a `Ring of Dark Matter' in the galaxy cluster CL 0024+17, see Jee M.J. et al. arXiv:0705.2171, based upon gravitational lensing data. Here we show that the lensing can be given an alternative explanation that does not involve `dark matter'. This explanation comes from the new dynamics of 3-space. This dynamics involves two constant G and alpha - the fine structure constant. This dynamics has explained the bore hole anomaly, spiral galaxy flat rotation speeds, the masses of black holes in spherical galaxies, gravitational light bending and lensing, all without invoking `dark matter', and also the supernova redshift data without the need for `dark energy'.",Human
"Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau free energy describing the normal state to Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state transition, we evaluate the free energy of seven most common lattice structures such as stripe, square, triangular,Simple Cubic (SC), Face centered Cubic (FCC),Body centered Cubic (BCC) and Quasi-crystal (QC). We find that the stripe phase which is the original LO state, is the most stable phase. This result maybe relevant to the detection of LOFF state in some heavy fermion compounds and the pairing lattice structure of fermions with unequal populations in the BCS side of Feshbach resonance in ultra-cold atoms.",Human
"The OPERA experiment, designed to conclusively prove the existence of $\rm \nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$ oscillations in the atmospheric sector, makes use of a massive lead-nuclear emulsion target to observe the appearance of $\rm \nu_\tau$'s in the CNGS $\rm \nu_\mu$ beam. The location and analysis of the neutrino interactions in quasi real-time required the development of fast computer-controlled microscopes able to reconstruct particle tracks with sub-micron precision and high efficiency at a speed of 20 cm^2 / h. This paper describes the performance in particle track reconstruction of the European Scanning System, a novel automatic microscope for the measurement of emulsion films developed for OPERA.",Human
"In Lagrangian turbulence one is faced with the puzzle that 2D   Navier-Stokes flows are nearly as intermittent as in three dimensions although no intermittency is present in the inverse cascade in 2D Eulerian turbulence. In addition, an inertial range is very difficult to detect and it is questionable whether it exists at all. Here, we investigate the transition of Eulerian to Lagrangian probability density functions (PDFs) which leads to a new type of Lagrangian structure function. This possesses an extended inertial range similar to the case of tracer particles in a frozen turbulent velocity field. This allows a connection to the scaling of Eulerian transversal structure functions.",Human
"We present a new design of dielectric microcavities supporting modes with large quality factors and highly directional light emission. The key idea is to place a point scatterer inside a dielectric circular microdisk. We show that, depending on the position and strength of the scatterer, this leads to strongly directional modes in various frequency regions while preserving the high Q-factors reminiscent of the whispering gallery modes of the microdisk without scatterer. The design is very appealing due to its simplicity, promising a cleaner experimental realisation than previously studied microcavity designs on the one hand and analytic tractability based on Green's function techniques and self-adjoint extension theory on the other.",Human
We describe an experimental setup designed to produce ultracold trapped gas clouds of fermionic 6Li and bosonic 87Rb. This combination of alkali metals has the potential to reach deeper Fermi degeneracy with respect to other mixtures since it allows for improved heat capacity matching which optimizes sympathetic cooling efficiency. Atomic beams of the two species are independently produced and then decelerated by Zeeman slowers. The slowed atoms are collected into a magneto-optical trap and then transferred into a quadrupole magnetic trap. An ultracold Fermi gas with temperature in the 10^-3 T_F range should be attainable through selective confinement of the two species via a properly detuned laser beam focused in the center of the magnetic trap.,Human
"Traceroute sampling is an important technique in exploring the internet router graph and the autonomous system graph. Although it is one of the primary techniques used in calculating statistics about the internet, it can introduce bias that corrupts these estimates. This paper reports on a theoretical and experimental investigation of a new technique to reduce the bias of traceroute sampling when estimating the degree distribution. We develop a new estimator for the degree of a node in a traceroute-sampled graph; validate the estimator theoretically in Erdos-Renyi graphs and, through computer experiments, for a wider range of graphs; and apply it to produce a new picture of the degree distribution of the autonomous system graph.",Human
"In a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 023004 (2007)] we have investigated the influence of attractive van der Waals interaction on the pair distribution and Penning ionization dynamics of ultracold Rydberg gases. Here we extend this description to atoms initially prepared in Rydberg states exhibiting repulsive interaction. We present calculations based on a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the dynamics of many atoms under the influence of both repulsive and attractive longrange interatomic forces. Redistribution to nearby states induced by black body radiation is taken into account, changing the effective interaction potentials. The model agrees with experimental observations, where the ionization rate is found to increase when the excitation laser is blue-detuned from the atomic resonance.",Human
"Anchoring is a term used in psychology to describe the common human tendency to rely too heavily (anchor) on one piece of information when making decisions. A trading algorithm inspired by biological motors, introduced by L. Gil\cite{Gil}, is suggested as a testing ground for anchoring in financial markets. An exact solution of the algorithm is presented for arbitrary price distributions. Furthermore the algorithm is extended to cover the case of a market neutral portfolio, revealing additional evidence that anchoring is involved in the decision making of market participants. The exposure of arbitrage possibilities created by anchoring gives yet another illustration on the difficulty proving market efficiency by only considering lower order correlations in past price time series",Human
Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is predicted for x rays in laser-dressed neon gas. The x-ray photoabsorption cross section and polarizability near the Ne K edge are calculated using an ab initio theory suitable for optical strong-field problems. The laser wavelength is tuned close to the transition between 1s^-1 3s and 1s^-1 3p (approximately 800nm). The minimum laser intensity required to observe EIT is of the order of 10^12 W/cm^2. The ab initio results are discussed in terms of an exactly solvable three-level model. This work opens new opportunities for research with ultrafast x-ray sources.,Human
"In this paper a systematic approach to the design of bulk isotropic magnetic metamaterials is presented. The role of the symmetries of both the constitutive element and the lattice are analyzed. For this purpose it is assumed that the metamaterial is composed by cubic SRR resonators, arranged in a cubic lattice. The minimum symmetries needed to ensure an isotropic behavior are analyzed, and some particular configurations are proposed. Besides, an equivalent circuit model is proposed for the considered cubic SRR resonators. Experiments are carried out in order to validate the proposed theory. We hope that this analysis will pave the way to the design of bulk metamaterials with strong isotropic magnetic response, including negative permeability and left-handed metamaterials.",Human
The problems of stripper target behavior in the nonstationary intense particle beams are considered. The historical sketch of studying of radiation damage failure of carbon targets under ion bombardment is presented. The simple model of evaporation of a target by an intensive pulsing beam is supposed. Stripper foils lifetimes in the nonstationary intense particle can be described by two failure mechanisms: radiation damage accumulation and evaporation of target. At the maximal temperatures less than 2500K the radiation damage are dominated; at temperatures above 2500K the mechanism of evaporation of a foil prevails. The proposed approach has been applied to the discription of behaviour of stripper foils in the BNL linac and SNS conditions.,Human
"It is studied the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database using a statistical technique of analysis, that is based on the Wavelet and Hilbert Transforms. With that technique, it was previously found, that there is a collective and intrinsic dynamical behavior up to a scale of 64 heartbeats. Now it is shown, that using the Biorthogonal wavelet bior3.1 such a behavior reaches the scale 1024. That result confirms, that the circulatory system is out of equilibrium. According to the Statistical Mechanics of Tsallis, and a recent interpretation of G. Wilk et al. respect to the non extensive parameter q, the healthy human being is characterized by q=1.70+/-0.01.",Human
In this comment it is pointed out that the electron velocity of the same order as observed in graphene had been measured in GaAs submicron devices long ago. Particle- antiparticle asymmetry related with electron and hole effective masses in graphene seems puzzling as hole in a condensed matter system cannot be treated as anti-electron. It is argued that there should be a universal electrodynamics for QHE and superconductivity. In this context attention is drawn to the new approach based on massless electron and the interpretation that magnetic field represents angular momentum of the photon fluid. Measurement of electron velocity in graphene and GaAs in parallel is suggested for testing the massless electrodynamics.,Human
"In this article we discuss network growth based on Prisoner's Dilemma(PD) where palyers on nodes in a network palay with its linked players. The players estimate total profits in the PD. When a new node is attached, the node make linkes to nodes in the network with the probabilities in proportion to the profits made by the game. Iterating this process, a network grows. We investigate properties of this type of growing networks, especially the degree distribution and time-depending strategy distribution by running computer simulation. We also find a sort of phase transition in the strategy distributions. For these phenomena given by computer simulation, theoretical studies are also carried out.",Human
"The redshift of galaxies is in general explained by the expansion of space. The flat space time theory of gravitation suggests an additional interpretation. In this theory gravitation is explained analogously to Maxwell's theory on a flat space-time metric and gravitation is described by a field (potentials) with which the proper time (atomic time) is defined. In addition to the proper time in the universe, the oberserver's time is stated. The oberserver's time interval is absolute whereas the interval of the proper time is time dependent. In particular, atomic clocks at distant objects are going slower than clocks at present. This explains the redshift of distant objects without assuming an expanding universe.",Human
"Physics was in crisis at the beginning of the twentieth century because the newborn Maxwell's electromagnetism defied mechanistic preconceptions. Albert Einstein understood that the solution to the crisis required an audacious reworking of the concepts of space and time. Special Relativity deeply modified our way of regarding space and time, in order to harmonize electromagnetism with the principle of relativity. As a consequence, lengths and elapsed times were stripped of the invariant character that classical Physics conferred them; in their place, the speed of light acquired that privileged status. Such revolutionary change forced Einstein to reformulate Newtonian mechanics, a step that led him to discover the mass-energy equivalence.",Human
A theoretical study of the energy distribution function of the negative hydrogen ion H- in typical conditions for multicusp ion sources is presented. The case of H/H2 mixture is studied by a Monte Carlo solution of the kinetic equation for H- transport. A simple analytical model is obtained for the case of a fully dissociated H plasma and uniform reduced electric field (E/N). Results are in good agreement with the two-group distribution deduced from laser photodetachment experiments and explain the low energy group as an effect of the charge exchange collisions of negative ions with H atoms.,Human
"With his General Theory of Relativity, Albert Einstein produced a revolution in our conception of reality and of the knowledge we can obtain from it. This revolution can be viewed from philosophy as leading to one of the great paradigms in the history of thought which, together with the Aristotelian and the Newtonian paradigms, embodied the different ways of conceiving the universe and our access to it. The comparison among these three paradigms allows us to understand how the human being has progressively lost his central place in the cosmos, not only in physical terms, but also in an epistemic sense, regarding his power of knowledge about reality.",Human
"Albert Einstein made fundamental contributions to the development of quantum mechanics. However, he was never satisfied with the quantum worldview. In fact, during most of his life he attempted to find inconsistencies and paradoxes within quantum mechanics. His famous quote ""God does not play dice"" shows how disturbing was to Einstein one of the most important aspects of quantum mechanics: non-determinism. In this paper we will present the basic concepts of quantum mechanics, we will describe Einstein's attempts to destroy it and we will discuss why we can nowadays state that, in this regard, Albert Einstein was not right.",Human
"Observations consisting of measurements on relationships for pairs of objects arise in many settings, such as protein interaction and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold. In this paper, we describe a latent variable model of such data called the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel. This model extends blockmodels for relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational structure, thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation. We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We explore applications to social and protein interaction networks.",Human
"We investigate the dynamics of a relativistic electron in a strongly nonlinear plasma wave in terms of classical mechanics by taking into account the action of the radiative reaction force. The two limiting cases are considered. In the first case where the energy of the accelerated electrons is low, the electron makes many betatron oscillations during the acceleration. In the second case where the energy of the accelerated electrons is high, the betatron oscillation period is longer than the electron residence time in the accelerating phase. We show that the force of radiative friction can severely limit the rate of electron acceleration in a plasma accelerator.",Human
"We present a compact $^{87}$Rb atomic source for high precision dual atom interferometers. The source is based on a double-stage magneto-optical trap (MOT) design, consisting of a 2-dimensional (2D)-MOT for efficient loading of a 3D-MOT. The accumulated atoms are precisely launched in a horizontal moving molasses. Our setup generates a high atomic flux ($>10^{10}$ atoms/s) with precise and flexibly tunable atomic trajectories as required for high resolution Sagnac atom interferometry. We characterize the performance of the source with respect to the relevant parameters of the launched atoms, i.e. temperature, absolute velocity and pointing, by utilizing time-of-flight techniques and velocity selective Raman transitions.",Human
"In this Letter we suggest a simple and physically transparent analytical model of the pressure driven turbulent wall-bounded flows at high but finite Reynolds numbers Re. The model gives accurate qualitative description of the profiles of the mean-velocity and Reynolds-stresses (second order correlations of velocity fluctuations) throughout the entire channel or pipe in the wide range of Re, using only three Re-independent parameters. The model sheds light on the long-standing controversy between supporters of the century-old log-law theory of von-K\`arm\`an and Prandtl and proposers of a newer theory promoting power laws to describe the intermediate region of the mean velocity profile.",Human
"Shear localization in an aqueous clay suspension of Laponite is investigated through dynamic light scattering, which provides access both to the dynamics of the system (homodyne mode) and to the local velocity profile (heterodyne mode). When the shear bands form, a relaxation of the dynamics typical of a gel phase is observed in the unsheared band soon after flow stop, suggesting that an arrested dynamics is present during the shear localization regime. Periodic oscillations of the flow behavior, typical of a stick-slip phenomenon, are also observed when shear localization occurs. Both results are discussed in the light of various theoretical models for soft glassy materials.",Human
"We study general aspects of active motion with fluctuations in the speed and the direction of motion in two dimensions. We consider the case in which fluctuations in the speed are not correlated to fluctuations in the direction of motion, and assume that both processes can be described by independent characteristic time-scales. We show the occurrence of a complex transient that can exhibit a series of alternating regimes of motion, for two different angular dynamics which correspond to persistent and directed random walks. We also show additive corrections to the diffusion coefficient. The characteristic time-scales are also exposed in the velocity autocorrelation, which is a sum of exponential forms.",Human
"In this paper we examine a number of methods for probing and understanding the large-scale structure of networks that evolve over time. We focus in particular on citation networks, networks of references between documents such as papers, patents, or court cases. We describe three different methods of analysis, one based on an expectation-maximization algorithm, one based on modularity optimization, and one based on eigenvector centrality. Using the network of citations between opinions of the United States Supreme Court as an example, we demonstrate how each of these methods can reveal significant structural divisions in the network, and how, ultimately, the combination of all three can help us develop a coherent overall picture of the network's shape.",Human
"Both the highest- and the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in wide temperature range appear at the optimally doped regions of Cu-based superconductors1,2,3,4,5, and the highest- of Fe-based superconductors6,7 are also associated with the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in normal states near superconducting states. This means that the high temperature superconductivity and the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity should be dominated by the same mechanism. This letter on theoretic calculation clearly shows that strong spin-charge correlation dominated resistivity behaves the linear temperature dependence, thus high-temperature superconductivity should be induced by strong spin-charge correlation.",Human
"The multiple scale expansion method is used to derive amplitude equations for a system with thermohaline convection in the neighborhood of Hopf and Taylor bifurcation points and at the double zero point of the dispersion relation. A complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, a Newell-Whitehead-type equation, and an equation of the $\phi^4$ type, respectively, were obtained. Analytic expressions for the coefficients of these equations and their various asymptotic forms are presented. In the case of Hopf bifurcation for low and high frequencies, the amplitude equation reduces to a perturbed nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. In the high-frequency limit, structures of the type of ""dark"" solitons are characteristic of the examined physical system.",Human
"Based on the concept of curved spacetime in Einsteinian General Relativity, the field theories and their quantum theories in the curved octonion spaces etc are discussed. The research results discover the close relationships of the curved spacetimes with the field theories and quantum theories. In the field theories of curved spacetimes, the curvatures have direct effect on field strength and field source etc. While the curvatures have direct impact on wave functions and quantum equations etc in the quantum theories of curved spacetimes. The research results discover that some abnormal phenomena of field source particles could be explained by the field theories or quantum theories in the curved spacetimes.",Human

The results of the procedure are the extinction values for atmospheric aerosol and water vapor at different altitudes in the troposphere along the Earth's terminator crossing North America, Arctic, Siberia and South-Eastern Asia. The altitude range and possible latitude and altitude resoltion of atmosphere remote sensing by the lunar eclipses observation are fixed. The results of water vapor retrieval are compared with data of space experiment, the scale of vertical water vapor distribution is found.",Human
"A novel concept of self-phasematched optical frequency conversion in dispersive dielectric microcavities is studied theoretically and experimentally. We develop a time-dependent model, incorporating the dispersion into the structure of the spatial cavity modes and translating the phasematching requirement into the optimization of a nonlinear cavity mode overlap. We design and fabricate integrated double-resonance semiconductor microcavities for self-phasematched second harmonic generation. The measured efficiency exhibits a significant maximum near the cavity resonance due to the intra-cavity enhancement of the input power and the dispersion-induced wavelength detuning effect on the mode overlap, in good agreement with our theoretical predictions.",Human
"In 2001, Seth Lloyd presented a radical new critique of the universe as a quantum computing device, with an upper limit of bit calculations of the order of 10 to the 120 power. We find that his calculations permit us to reconcile the existance of a huge cosmological constant 10 to the minus 43 seconds after the big bang, with a resulting huge relic graviton flux, with the existance of a CMBR observational barrier of z = 1100 years after the big bang. Lloyd's calculations pre suppose the existence of a huge entropy value during the nucleation of a new universe, a datum we think helps shed light on the cosmological landscape problem.",Human
"We have realized a two dimensional permanent magnetic lattice of Ioffe-Pritchard microtraps for ultracold atoms. The lattice is formed by a single 300 nm magnetized layer of FePt, patterned using optical lithography. Our magnetic lattice consists of more than 15000 tightly confining microtraps with a density of 1250 traps/mm$^2$. Simple analytical approximations for the magnetic fields produced by the lattice are used to derive relevant trap parameters. We load ultracold atoms into at least 30 lattice sites at a distance of approximately 10 $\mu$m from the film surface. The present result is an important first step towards quantum information processing with neutral atoms in magnetic lattice potentials.",Human
"Lieberman and Melott built their recent arXiv preprint 0704.2896 on my published paper and (a preprint of) a subsequent comment by Liebermans associate Cornette. But had this group waited for the Cornette comment to actually appear in print together with the expected Reply, they would have learned that his comment exposes Cornettes confusion that likely was due to journal misprint of my figure. Thus 0704.2896 is baseless. Despite receiving the extended Reply with Errata, these authors still fail to recognize that detrending of paleontological records-which they erroneously promote as a must-is an arbitrary rather than a universal operation.",Human
"The fate of aerosols in open flows is relevant in a variety of physical contexts. Previous results are consistent with the assumption that such finite-size particles always escape in open chaotic advection. Here we show that a different behavior is possible. We analyze the dynamics of aerosols both in the absence and presence of gravitational effects, and both when the dynamics of the fluid particles is hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic. Permanent trapping of aerosols much heavier than the advecting fluid is shown to occur in all these cases. This phenomenon is determined by the occurrence of multiple vortices in the flow and is predicted to happen for realistic particle-fluid density ratios.",Human
"This paper, which commented on Newman and Leicht's ""Mixture models and exploratory analysis in networks"" (2007, PNAS 104, 9564-9569), has been withdrawn. The reason for this removal is that we misinterpreted the conceptual framework that the authors of the original paper use. Specifically, it is assumed in our paper that the variable theta_ri denotes the *a priori* probability that there exists an edge from group r to vertex i. The correct interpretation is that theta_ri denotes the probability that a given edge from group r connects to vertex i.   We are very grateful to Mark Newman and Elizabeth Leicht not only for pointing out our misinterpretation, but also for doing it so politely and gracefully.",Human
"The demand for high-speed digital communication such as data, video, and the broadband Internet increases, the required throughput of the modules in communications systems will also increase.

It is specialised for the academic training at universities to demonstrate the principles of the WDM techniques. It works platform independent in combination with active modules in the training description, short inline videos and interactive diagrams. The system consists of LEDs in different wavelengths using analog and digital signals.",Human
"Special relativity turns out to be more than coordinate transformations in which the constancy of the speed of light plays the central role between two inertial reference frames. Special relativity, in essence, is a theory of four-dimensional flat spacetime. Euclidian space spans three of the spacetime's dimensions and time spans the fourth. Properties of light may not be needed to describe spacetime, which exists independently of light. The article shows that a theory of spacetime can be constructed from a geometric viewpoint in which the speed of light does not play any role. Moreover postulating four-dimensional geometry significantly simplifies the concept of special relativity.",Human
"We report the laser-cooling and confinement of Cd atoms in a magneto-optical trap, and characterize the loading process from the background Cd vapor. The trapping laser drives the 1S0-1P1 transition at 229 nm in this two-electron atom and also photoionizes atoms directly from the 1P1 state. This photoionization overwhelms the other loss mechanisms and allows a direct measurement of the photoionization cross section, which we measure to be 2(1)x10^(-16)cm^(2) from the 1P1 state. When combined with nearby laser-cooled and trapped Cd^(+) ions, this apparatus could facilitate studies in ultracold interactions between atoms and ions.",Human
"We investigate the effects of a time-correlated noise on an extended chaotic system. The chosen model is the Lorenz'96, a kind of ""toy"" model used for climate studies. Through the analysis of the system's time evolution and its time and space correlations, we have obtained numerical evidence for two stochastic resonance-like behavior. Such behavior is seen when both, the usual and a generalized signal-to-noise ratio function are depicted as a function of the external noise intensity or the system size. The underlying mechanism seems to be associated to a ""noise-induced chaos reduction"". The possible relevance of these and other findings for an ""optimal"" climate prediction are discussed.",Human
"We propose a new simple model for DNA denaturation bases on the pendulum model of Englander\cite{A1} and the microscopic model of Peyrard {\it et al.},\cite{A3} so called ""combined model"". The main parameters of our model are: the coupling constant $k$ along each strand, the mean stretching $y^\ast$ of the hydrogen bonds, the ratio of the damping constant and driven force $\gamma/F$. We show that both the length $L$ of unpaired bases and the velocity $v$ of kinks depend on not only the coupling constant $k$ but also the temperature $T$. Our results are in good agreement with previous works.",Human
"Using one-center expansion relations for the Slater type orbitals (STOs) of noninteger principal quantum numbers in terms of integer n STOs derived in this study with the help of - exponential type orbitals (-ETOs, the general formulas are established for the unsymmetrical and symmetrical one-range addition theorems of STOs and Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated interaction potentials (CIPs) with integer and noninteger indices. The final results are especially useful for computations of arbitrary multicenter multielectron integrals over STOs that arise in the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan (HFR) approximation and also in the correlated methods which play a significant role in theory and application to quantum mechanics of atoms, molecules, and solids.",Human
"We investigate the dynamics of football matches. Our goal is to characterize statistically the temporal sequence of ball movements in this collective sport game, searching for traits of complex behavior. Data were collected over a variety of matches in South American, European and World championships throughout 2005 and 2006. We show that the statistics of ball touches presents power-law tails and can be described by $q$-gamma distributions. To explain such behavior we propose a model that provides information on the characteristics of football dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss the statistics of duration of out-of-play intervals, not directly related to the previous scenario.",Human
"We demonstrate superradiant conversion between a two-mode collective atomic state and a single-mode light field in an elongated cloud of Bose-condensed atoms. Two off-resonant write beams induce superradiant Raman scattering, producing two independent coherence gratings with a different wave vector in the cloud. By applying phase-matched read beams after a controllable delay, the gratings can be selectively converted into the light field also in a superradiant way. Due to the large cooperativity parameter and the small velocity width of the condensate, a high conversion efficiency of $> 70$ % and a long storage time of $> 120$ $\mu$s were achieved.",Human

"It has often been claimed that the proposed Earth artificial satellite LARES/WEBER-SAT-whose primary goal is, in fact, the measurement of the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect at a some percent level-would allow to greatly improve, among (many) other things, the present-day (10^-13) level of accuracy in testing the equivalence principle as well. Recent claims point towards even two orders of magnitude better, i.e. 10^-15. In this note we show that such a goal is, in fact, unattainable by many orders of magnitude being, instead, the achievable level of the order of 10^-9.",Human
"Electric fields in a plasma that conducts a high-current pulse are measured as a function of time and space. The experiment is performed using a coaxial configuration, in which a current rising to 160 kA in 100 ns is conducted through a plasma that prefills the region between two coaxial electrodes. The electric field is determined using laser spectroscopy and line-shape analysis. Plasma doping allows for 3D spatially resolved measurements. The measured peak magnitude and propagation velocity of the electric field is found to match those of the Hall electric field, inferred from the magnetic-field front propagation measured previously.",Human
"The composite CBS-QB3 method is widely used to obtain accurate energies of molecules and radicals although its use in the case of singlet diradicals gives rise to some difficulties. The problem is related to the parameterized correction this method introduces to account for spin-contamination. We report a new term specifically designed to describe singlet diradicals separated by at least one CH2 unit. As a test case, we have computed the formation enthalpy of a series of diradicals that includes hydrocarbons as well as systems involving heteroatoms (nitrogen, oxygen). The resulting CBS-QB3 energies are very close to experiment.",Human
The prediction of auto-ignition delay times in HCCI engines has risen interest on detailed chemical models. This paper described a validated kinetic mechanism for the oxidation of a model Diesel fuel (n-decane and &#945;-methylnaphthalene). The 3D model for the description of low and high temperature auto-ignition in engines is presented. The behavior of the model fuel is compared with that of n-heptane. Simulations show that the 3D model coupled with the kinetic mechanism can reproduce experimental HCCI and Diesel engine results and that the correct modeling of auto-ignition in the cool flame region is essential in HCCI conditions.,Human
"A two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime diagram is neatly represented on a Euclidean ordinary plane. However the Euclidean lengths of the lines on the diagram do not correspond to the true values of physical quantities in spacetime, except for those referring to the stationary reference frame. In order to extend its abilities to other inertial reference frames, we derive a factor which, multiplied by the magnitude of the actually displayed values (on the diagram), leads to the corresponding true measured values by any other inertial observers. Doing so, the student can infer from the Euclidean diagram plot the expressions that account for Lorentz length contraction, time dilation and also Lorentz Transformations just by using regular trigonometry.",Human
"Multifractal analysis and extensive statistical tests are performed upon intraday minutely data within individual trading days for four stock market indexes (including HSI, SZSC, S&P500, and NASDAQ) to check whether the indexes (instead of the returns) possess multifractality. We find that the mass exponent $\tau(q)$ is linear and the singularity $\alpha(q)$ is close to 1 for all trading days and all indexes. Furthermore, we find strong evidence showing that the scaling behaviors of the original data sets cannot be distinguished from those of the shuffled time series. Hence, the so-called multifractality in the intraday stock market indexes is merely an illusion.",Human
"Detecting community structure in real-world networks is a challenging problem. Recently, it has been shown that the resolution of methods based on optimizing a modularity measure or a corresponding energy is limited; communities with sizes below some threshold remain unresolved. One possibility to go around this problem is to vary the threshold by using a tuning parameter, and investigate the community structure at variable resolutions. Here, we analyze the resolution limit and multiresolution behavior for two different methods: a q-state Potts method proposed by Reichard and Bornholdt, and a recent multiresolution method by Arenas, Fernandez, and Gomez. These methods are studied analytically, and applied to three test networks using simulated annealing.",Human
"Preferential attachment is a popular generative mechanism to explain the widespread observation of power law distributed networks. We introduce an alternative explanation for the phenomenon by allowing the link growth rates to vary across the nodes according to a randomized Poisson process. The distribution of rates, which reproduces the degree distribution of a preferential attachment process (Yule process) is derived analytically. We demonstrate with use of simulations that the degree distribution and growth rates in single time intervals are similar for the random process and the preferential attachment process. Structural differences are analyzed by examining the joint degree distribution and network coreness.",Human
"We study the length distribution of a particular class of DNA sequences known as 5'UTR exons. These exons belong to the messanger RNA of protein coding genes, but they are not coding (they are located upstream of the coding portion of the mRNA) and are thus less constrained from an evolutionary point of view. We show that both in mouse and in human these exons show a very clean power law decay in their length distribution and suggest a simple evolutionary model which may explain this finding. We conjecture that this power law behaviour could indeed be a general feature of higher eukaryotes.",Human
"Aerosols under chaotic advection often approach a strange attractor. They move chaotically on this fractal set but, in the presence of gravity, they have a net vertical motion downwards. In practical situations, observational data may be available only at a given level, for example at the ground level. We uncover two fractal signatures of chaotic advection of aerosols under the action of gravity. Each one enables the computation of the fractal dimension $D_{0}$ of the strange attractor governing the advection dynamics from data obtained solely at a given level. We illustrate our theoretical findings with a numerical experiment and discuss their possible relevance to meteorology.",Human
"This is the first in a series of articles in which we study the rotating Morse potential model for diatomic molecules in the tridiagonal J-matrix representation. Here, we compute the bound states energy spectrum by diagonalizing the finite dimensional Hamiltonian matrix of H2, LiH, HCl and CO molecules for arbitrary angular momentum. The calculation was performed using the J-matrix basis that supports a tridiagonal matrix representation for the reference Hamiltonian. Our results for these diatomic molecules have been compared with available numerical data satisfactorily. The proposed method is handy, very efficient, and it enhances accuracy by combining analytic power with a convergent and stable numerical technique.",Human
"The authors study the ultrafast switching-on and -off of planar GaAs/AlAs microcavities. Up to 0.8% refractive index changes are achieved by optically exciting free carriers at 1720 nm and a pulse energy of 1.8 micro Joules. The cavity resonance is dynamically tracked by measuring reflectivity versus time delay with tunable laser pulses, and is found to shift by as much as 3.3 linewidths within a few picoseconds. The switching-off occurs with a decay time of around 50 ps. The authors derive the dynamic behavior of the carrier density and of the complex refractive index. They propose that the inferred 10 GHz switching rate may be tenfold improved by optimized sample growth.",Human
"Unexpected spectral features are observed in the two photon spectrum of the pure water in the forward direction when an 80 femtosecond laser pulse is focused at 10^10Wcm-2 or less. Such intensity is much lower than the breakdown or stimulated threshold of the liquid water. The two broad features are about 2700cm-1 and 5000cm-1 red shifted from the hyper-Rayleigh wavelength, respectively, and they are quadratic with the laser intensity. They do not match the known Raman or hyper-Raman frequencies of water, and they are both centered at a narrow angle in the forward direction. Several other liquids also exhibited similar but molecular specific spectral features.",Human
"In this paper, we present a new model, hollow Gaussian-Schell model beams (HGSMBs), to describe the practical dark hollow beams. An analytical propagation formula for HGSMBs passing through a paraxial first-order optical system is derived based on the theory of coherence. Based on the derived formula, an application example showing the influence of spatial coherence on the propagation of beams is illustrated. It is found that the beam propagating properties of HGSMBs will be greatly affected by their spatial coherence. Our model provides a very convenient way for analyzing the propagation properties of partially coherent dark hollow beams.",Human
"In the previous report, we have demonstrated cascade branching channels of the multipolar E3 transition of rhodium Mossbauer gamma via the time- and energy-resolved spectroscopy. Moreover, superradiance in the Borrmann channel from inverted nuclei gives gamma entanglement. In this letter, we report further four observations of superradiance and its associated gamma entanglement at the liquid-nitrogen temperature, i.e. (i) speed-up decay, (ii) immediate recovery of the speed-up decay after quenching, (iii) simultaneous suppression of gamma and K lines, and (iv) enhanced multiple ionizations. Anisotropic superradiant channels open by quenching and recover back immediately after quenching. Enhanced K satellites and K hypersatellites induced by cooling are attributed to the inelastic scattering of more than three entangled gammas.",Human
"We present results of the performance of the second prototype of the CASTOR quartz-tungsten sampling calorimeter, to be installed in the very forward region of the CMS experiment at the LHC. The energy linearity and resolution, as well as the spatial resolution of the prototype to electromagnetic and hadronic showers are studied with E=20-200 GeV electrons, E=20-350 GeV pions, and E=50,150 GeV muons from beam tests carried out at CERN/SPS in 2004. The responses of the calorimeter using two different types of photodetectors (avalanche photodiodes APDs, and photomultiplier tubes PMTs) are compared.",Human
"The first and most compelling evidence of the universe's expansion was, and continues to be, the observed redshift of spectra from distant objects. This paper plays ""devil's advocate"" by providing an alternative explanation with elementary physics. I assume a steady-state universe that is infinite in both expanse and age, with the observed redshifts caused by particle interactions creating an overall index of refraction of the universe. The cumulative effects of these interactions over long distances cause not only the shifts that we observe, but also the monotonically increasing redshifts as more distant objects are observed. This is a novel explanation for the phenomenon known as ""tired light"" which has been discussed for decades.",Human
"The variational method, within the Hamiltonian formalism of reformulated QED is used to determine relativistic wave equations for a system of three fermions of arbitrary mass interacting electromagnetically. The interaction kernels of the equations are, in essence, the invariant $\mathcal{M}$ matrices in lowest order. The equations are used to obtain relativistic $O(\alpha^2)$ corrections to the non-relativistic ground state energy levels of the Muonium negative ion ($\mu^+ e^- e^-$) as well as of $\mathrm{Ps}^-$ and $\mathrm{H}^-$, using approximate variational three-body wave functions. The results are compared with other calculations, where available. The relativistic correction for Mu$^-$ is found to be $-1.0773 \times 10^{-4}$ eV.",Human
"We demonstrate experimentally that structural perturbations imposed on highly-dispersive photonic crystal-based waveguides give rise to spectral features that bear signatures of Anderson localization. Sharp resonances with the effective Qs of over 30,000 are found in scattering spectra of disordered waveguides. The resonances are observed in a ~20-nm bandwidth centered at the cutoff of slowly-guided Bloch-modes. Their origin can be explained with interference of coherently scattered electromagnetic waves which results in the formation of a narrow impurity (or localization) band populated with spectrally distinct quasistates. Standard photon localization criteria are fulfilled in the localization band.",Human
"The resolution associated with the so-called perfect lens of thickness $d$ is $-2\pi d/\ln(|\chi+2|/2)$. Here the susceptibility $\chi$ is a Hermitian function in $H^2$ of the upper half-plane, i.e., a $H^2$ function satisfying $\chi(-\omega)=\bar{\chi(\omega)}$. An additional requirement is that the imaginary part of $\chi$ be nonnegative for nonnegative arguments. Given an interval $I$ on the positive half-axis, we compute the distance in $L^\infty(I)$ from a negative constant to this class of functions. This result gives a surprisingly simple and explicit formula for the optimal resolution of the perfect lens on a finite bandwidth.",Human
Femtosecond PTHB spectroscopy was expected to demonstrate the existence of distinct s-p absorption subbands originating from the three nondegenerate p-like excited states of hydrated electron in anisotropic solvation cavity. Yet no conclusive experimental evidence either for this subband structure or the reorientation of the cavity on the picosecond time scale has been obtained. We demonstrate that rapid reorientation of s-p transition dipole moments in response to small scale motion of water molecules is the likely culprit. The polarized bleach is shown to be too small and too short lived to be observed reliably on the sub-picosecond time scale.,Human
"The exact formula for the average path length of Apollonian networks is found. With the help of recursion relations derived from the self-similar structure, we obtain the exact solution of average path length, $\bar{d}_t$, for Apollonian networks. In contrast to the well-known numerical result $\bar{d}_t \propto (\ln N_t)^{3/4}$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{94}, 018702 (2005)], our rigorous solution shows that the average path length grows logarithmically as $\bar{d}_t \propto \ln N_t$ in the infinite limit of network size $N_t$. The extensive numerical calculations completely agree with our closed-form solution.",Human
"Gaseous detectors are fundamental components of all present and planned high energy physics experiments.   Over the past decade two representatives (GEM, Micromegas) of the Micro-Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) concept have become increasingly important; the high radiation resistance and excellent spatial and time resolution make them an invaluable tool to confront future detector challenges at the next generation of colliders.   Novel structures where GEM and Micromegas are directly coupled to the CMOS multi-pixel readout represent an exciting field and allow to reconstruct fine-granularity, two-dimensional images of physics events. Originally developed for the high energy physics, MPGD applications have expanded to astrophysics, neutrino physics, neutron detection and medical imaging.",Human
"I describe a method for generating ""shim pulses"" for NMR spectroscopy and imaging (MRI) by taking advantage of the inherent inhomogeneity in the static and radiofrequency (RF) fields of a one-sided NMR system. The RF inhomogeneity here is assumed, without loss of generality, to be a linear gradient. General polynomials in the spatial variables can be generated using x, y and z RF gradients using trains of hard pulses which result in linear combinations of monomials xy, y^2, xz etc., and any desired scalings of these monomials. The basic shim pulse is constructed using small tip angle approximations.",Human
"We present experiments on the slow growth of a single crack in a fax paper sheet submitted to a constant force $F$. We find that statistically averaged crack growth curves can be described by only two parameters : the mean rupture time $\tau$ and a characteristic growth length $\zeta$. We propose a model based on a thermally activated rupture process that takes into account the microstructure of cellulose fibers. The model is able to reproduce the shape of the growth curve, the dependence of $\zeta$ on $F$ as well as the effect of temperature on the rupture time $\tau$. We find that the length scale at which rupture occurs in this model is consistently close to the diameter of cellulose microfibrils.",Human
"Starting from the resurgence equation discovered by Berry and Howls [M. V. Berry and C. Howls ""Hyperasymptotics for integrals with saddles,"" Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 434, 657-675 (1991)], the Weniger transformation is here proposed as a natural, efficient, and straightforwardly implementable scheme for the efficient asymptotics evaluation of a class of integrals occurring in several areas of physics and, in particular, of optics. Preliminary numerical tests, carried out on the Pearcey function, provide a direct comparison between the performances of Weniger transformation and those of Hyperasymptotics, which seems to corroborate the theoretical predictions. We believe that Weniger transformation would be a very useful computational tool for the asymptotic treatment of several optical problems.",Human
"We report experimental measurements of the transmission spectrum of an optical cavity coupled with cold Rb atoms. We observe the multi-atom vacuum Rabi splitting of a composite cavity and atom system. When a coupling field is applied to the atoms and induces the resonant two-photon Raman transition with the cavity field in a Lamda-type three-level system, we observe a cavity transmission spectrum with two vacuum Rabi sidebands and a central peak representing the intracavity dark state. The central peak linewidth is significantly narrowed by the dark-state resonance and its position is insensitive to the frequency change of the empty cavity.",Human
"Purcell's scallop theorem defines the type of motions of a solid body - reciprocal motions - which cannot propel the body in a viscous fluid with zero Reynolds number. For example, the flapping of a wing is reciprocal and, as was recently shown, can lead to directed motion only if its frequency Reynolds number, Re_f, is above a critical value of order one. Using elementary examples, we show the existence of oscillatory reciprocal motions which are effective for all arbitrarily small values of the frequency Reynolds number and induce net velocities scaling as (Re_f)^\alpha (alpha > 0). This demonstrates a continuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with inertia.",Human
"Two-frequency radiative transfer (2f-RT) theory is developed for geometrical optics in random media. The space-frequency correlation is described by the two-frequency Wigner distribution (2f-WD) which satisfies a closed form equation, the two-frequency Wigner-Moyal equation. In the RT regime it is proved rigorously that 2f-WD satisfies a Fokker-Planck-like equation with complex-valued coefficients. By dimensional analysis 2f-RT equation yields the scaling behavior of three physical parameters: the spatial spread, the coherence length and the coherence bandwidth. The sub-transport-mean-free-path behavior is obtained in a closed form by analytically solving a paraxial 2f-RT equation.",Human
"We study experimentally the slow growth of a single crack in polycarbonate films submitted to uniaxial and constant imposed stress. The specificity of fracture in polycarbonate films is the appearance of flame shaped macroscopic process zones at the tips of the crack. Supported by an experimental study of the mechanical properties of polycarbonate films, an analysis of the stress dependence of the mean ratio between the process zone and crack lengths, during the crack growth, show a quantitative agreement with the Dugdale-Barenblatt model of the plastic process zone. We find that the fracture growth curves obey strong scaling properties that lead to a well defined growth master curve.",Human
"We report evaluations of a resonant kinetic equation that suggest the slow time evolution of the Garrett and Munk spectrum is {\em not}, in fact, slow. Instead nonlinear transfers lead to evolution time scales that are smaller than one wave period at high vertical wavenumber. Such values of the transfer rates are inconsistent with conventional wisdom that regards the Garrett and Munk spectrum as an approximate stationary state and puts the self-consistency of a resonant kinetic equation at a serious risk. We explore possible reasons for and resolutions of this paradox. Inclusion of near-resonant interactions decreases the rate at which the spectrum evolves. This leads to improved self-consistency of the kinetic equation.",Human
"Dynamical processes taking place on real networks define on them evolving subnetworks whose topology is not necessarily the same of the underlying one. We investigate the problem of determining the emerging degree distribution, focusing on a class of tree-like processes, such as those used to explore the Internet's topology. A general theory based on mean-field arguments is proposed, both for single-source and multiple-source cases, and applied to the specific example of the traceroute exploration of networks. Our results provide a qualitative improvement in the understanding of dynamical sampling and of the interplay between dynamics and topology in large networks like the Internet.",Human
"We present a molecular dynamics test of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in a paradigmatic long-range-interacting many-body classical Hamiltonian system, the HMF model. We calculate sums of velocities at equidistant times along deterministic trajectories for different sizes and energy densities. We show that, when the system is in a chaotic regime (specifically, at thermal equilibrium), ergodicity is essentially verified, and the Pdfs of the sums appear to be Gaussians, consistently with the standard CLT. When the system is, instead, only weakly chaotic (specifically, along longstanding metastable Quasi-Stationary States), nonergodicity (i.e., discrepant ensemble and time averages) is observed, and robust $q$-Gaussian attractors emerge, consistently with recently proved generalizations of the CLT.",Human
"A coherent superposition of rotational states in D$_2$ has been excited by nonresonant ultrafast (12 femtosecond) intense (2 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ Wcm$^{-2}$) 800 nm laser pulses leading to impulsive dynamic alignment. Field-free evolution of this rotational wavepacket has been mapped to high temporal resolution by a time-delayed pulse, initiating rapid double ionization, which is highly sensitive to the angle of orientation of the molecular axis with respect to the polarization direction, $\theta$. The detailed fractional revivals of the neutral D$_2$ wavepacket as a function of $\theta$ and evolution time have been observed and modelled theoretically.",Human
"The high-accuracy W4 computational thermochemistry protocol, and several post-W4 methods, have been applied to the P$_2$ and P$_4$ molecules. Contrary to previous studies, we find the experimental thermochemistry to be fundamentally sound. The reaction enthalpy for P$_4\to 2$P$_2$ has a very significant contribution from post-CCSD(T) correlation effects. We derive a gas-phase heat of formation for the phosphorus atom of $\Delta H^\circ_{f,0}$[P(g)]=75.54$\pm$0.1 kcal/mol and $\Delta H^\circ_{f,298}$[P(g)]=75.74$\pm$0.1 kcal/mol, in the upper half of the CODATA uncertainty interval.",Human
"We solve the Unanimity Rule on networks with exponential, uniform and scalefree degree distributions. In particular we arrive at equations relating the asymptotic number of nodes in one of two states to the initial fraction of nodes in this state. The solutions for exponential and uniform networks are exact, the approximation for the scalefree case is in perfect agreement with simulation results. We use these solutions to provide a theoretical understanding for experimental data on biodiversity loss in foodwebs, which is available for the three network types discussed. The model allows in principle to estimate the critical value of species that have to be removed from the system to induce its complete collapse.",Human
"We evidence the existence of plasma oscillations of electrons-positron pairs created by the vacuum polarization in an uniform electric field with E < Ec. Our general treatment, encompassing also the traditional, well studied case of E > Ec, shows the existence in both cases of a maximum Lorentz factor acquired by electrons and positrons and allows determination of the a maximal length of oscillation. We quantitatively estimate how plasma oscillations reduce the rate of pair creation and increase the time scale of the pair production. These results are particularly relevant in view of the experimental progress in approaching the field strengths E < Ec.",Human
"The phase coherence of an ultrastable optical frequency reference is fully maintained over actively stabilized fiber networks of lengths exceeding 30 km. For a 7-km link installed in an urban environment, the transfer instability is $6 \times 10^{-18}$ at 1-s. The excess phase noise of 0.15 rad, integrated from 8 mHz to 25 MHz, yields a total timing jitter of 0.085 fs. A 32-km link achieves similar performance. Using frequency combs at each end of the coherent-transfer fiber link, a heterodyne beat between two independent ultrastable lasers, separated by 3.5 km and 163 THz, achieves a 1-Hz linewidth.",Human
"It is shown that the charged particles are refracted and reflected on the boundary of field free and laser field regions in vacuum. Simple and transparent estimates are given which show the possibility of channeling of charged and neutral particles having polarizability by strong electromagnetic field of certain laser bunches just as by the field of orientated crystalline planes and axes. These processes can be applied for production of femtosecond sliced electron bunches, for measurement their length and particle distribution as well as for production of femtosecond X-ray and terahertz pulses using transition, channeling and other types of radiation.",Human
"In this paper we review our earlier work on quantum computing and the Nash Equilibrium, in particular, tracing the history of the discovery of new Nash Equilibria and then reviewing the ways in which quantum computing may be expected to generate new classes of Nash equilibria. We then extend this work through a substantive analysis of examples provided by Meyer, Flitney, Iqbal and Weigert and Cheon and Tsutsui with respect to quantized games, quantum game strategies and the extension of Nash Equilibrium to solvable games in Hilbert space. Finally, we review earlier work by Sato, Taiji and Ikegami on non-linear computation and computational classes by way of reference to coherence, decoherence and quantum computating systems.",Human
"While it remains the staple of virtually all cosmological teaching, the concept of expanding space in explaining the increasing separation of galaxies has recently come under fire as a dangerous idea whose application leads to the development of confusion and the establishment of misconceptions. In this paper, we develop a notion of expanding space that is completely valid as a framework for the description of the evolution of the universe and whose application allows an intuitive understanding of the influence of universal expansion. We also demonstrate how arguments against the concept in general have failed thus far, as they imbue expanding space with physical properties not consistent with the expectations of general relativity.",Human
"Encapsulation layers are explored for passivating the surfaces of silicon to reduce optical absorption in the 1500-nm wavelength band. Surface-sensitive test structures consisting of microdisk resonators are fabricated for this purpose. Based on previous work in silicon photovoltaics, coatings of SiNx and SiO2 are applied under varying deposition and annealing conditions. A short dry thermal oxidation followed by a long high-temperature N2 anneal is found to be most effective at long-term encapsulation and reduction of interface absorption. Minimization of the optical loss is attributed to simultaneous reduction in sub-bandgap silicon surface states and hydrogen in the capping material.",Human
"Critical points of a scalar quantitiy are either extremal points or saddle points. The character of the critical points is determined by the sign distribution of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. For a two-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic random function topological arguments are sufficient to show that all possible sign combinations are equidistributed or with other words, the density of the saddle points and extrema agree. This argument breaks down in three dimensions. All ratios of the densities of saddle points and extrema larger than one are possible. For a homogeneous Gaussian random field one finds no longer an equidistribution of signs, saddle points are slightly more frequent.",Human
"We used the atomic force microscope to manipulate and unfold individual molecules of the titin I27 domain and reconstructed its free energy surface using Jarzynski's equality. The free energy surface for both stretching and unfolding was reconstructed using an exact formula that relates the nonequilibrium work fluctuations to the molecular free energy. In addition, the unfolding free energy barrier, i.e. the activation energy, was directly obtained from experimental data for the first time. This work demonstrates that Jarzynski's equality can be used to analyze nonequilibrium single-molecule experiments, and to obtain the free energy surfaces for molecular systems, including interactions for which only nonequilibrium work can be measured.",Human
"In KEKB, synchrotron radiation interferometers (SRMs) are used for measuring the transverse beam sizes. There is also a tool for enlarging the vertical beam size intentionally by making an asymmetric bump, called an ``iSize'' bump, at one of the strongest non-interleaved sextupole magnets in each KEKB ring. The calibrations of the SRMs were checked by comparing the measured vertical beam sizes with those calculated using the computer code ``SAD''. The obtained correction factors are 1.000$\pm$0.045 for HER and 0.971$\pm$0.060 for LER, which are consistent with the calibration factors of SRMs\cite{SRMcalib} within errors. Using the obtained calibration factor, x-y coupling of each ring was calculated .",Human
"The one-mode projecting is extensively used to compress the bipartite networks. Since the one-mode projection is always less informative than the bipartite representation, a proper weighting method is required to better retain the original information. In this article, inspired by the network-based resource-allocation dynamics, we raise a weighting method, which can be directly applied in extracting the hidden information of networks, with remarkably better performance than the widely used global ranking method as well as collaborative filtering. This work not only provides a creditable method in compressing bipartite networks, but also highlights a possible way for the better solution of a long-standing challenge in modern information science: How to do personal recommendation?",Human
"We analyze an optical 3-port reflection grating by means of a scattering matrix formalism. Amplitude and phase relations between the 3 ports, i.e. the 3 orders of diffraction are derived. Such a grating can be used as an all-reflective, low-loss coupler to Fabry-Perot cavities. We derive the input output relations of a 3-port grating coupled cavity and find distinct properties not present in 2-port coupled cavities. The cavity relations further reveal that the 3-port coupler can be designed such that the additional cavity port interferes destructively. In this case the all-reflective, low-loss, single-ended Fabry-Perot cavity becomes equivalent to a standard transmissive, 2-port coupled cavity.",Human
"The deformation at the core-mantle boundary produced by the 2004 Sumatra earthquake is investigated by means of a semi-analytic theoretical model of global coseismic and postseismic deformation, predicting a millimetric coseismic perturbation over a large portion of the core-mantle boundary. Spectral features of such deformations are analysed and discussed. The time-dependent postseismic evolution of the elliptical part of the gravity field (J2) is also computed for different asthenosphere viscosity models. Our results show that, for asthenospheric viscosities smaller than 10^18 Pa s, the postseismic J2 variation in the next years is expected to leave a detectable signal in geodetic observations.",Human
"The bifurcation structure of the Langford equation is studied numerically in detail. Periodic, doubly-periodic, and chaotic solutions and the routes to chaos via coexistence of double periodicity and period-doubling bifurcations are found by the Poincar\'e plot of successive maxima of the first mode $x_1$. Frequency-locked periodic solutions corresponding to the Farey sequence $F_n$ are examined up to $n=14$. Period-doubling bifurcations appears on some of the periodic solutions and the similarity of bifurcation structures between the sine-circle map and the Langford equation is shown. A method to construct the Poincar\'e section for triple periodicity is proposed.",Human
"Interaction is the mode of being of material things amid other material things and the driving force of change and wholeness. Through mutual influence, changes of interacting things become interdependent and their properties interrelated, which leads to formation of ensembles - material wholes of correlated things, where the mode of being of a particular component depends on the modes of being of all other components and vice versa. Every ensemble attains its wholeness and becomes a physical body through togetherness of interrelated components coexisting as a collective being with mutually restrained internal motion. Properties of ensembles on all structural levels of matter composition emerge through the collective being of components.",Human
"We test a segmentation algorithm, based on the calculation of the Jensen-Shannon divergence between probability distributions, to two symbolic sequences of literary and musical origin. The first sequence represents the successive appearance of characters in a theatrical play, and the second represents the succession of tones from the twelve-tone scale in a keyboard sonata. The algorithm divides the sequences into segments of maximal compositional divergence between them. For the play, these segments are related to changes in the frequency of appearance of different characters and in the geographical setting of the action. For the sonata, the segments correspond to tonal domains and reveal in detail the characteristic tonal progression of such kind of musical composition.",Human
Classical radiation equilibrium (the blackbody problem) is investigated by the use of an analogy. Scaling symmetries are noted for systems of classical charged particles moving in circular orbits in central potentials V(r)=-k/r^n when the particles are held in uniform circular motion against radiative collapse by a circularly polarized incident plane wave. Only in the case of a Coulomb potential n=1 with fixed charge e is there a unique scale-invariant spectrum of radiation versus frequency (analogous to zero-point radiation) obtained from the stable scattering arrangement. These results suggest that non-electromagnetic potentials are not appropriate for discussions of classical radiation equilibrium.,Human
"We investigate the effect of temperature on resonant and antiresonant dynamics in a dilute atomic gas kicked periodically by a standing wave laser field. Our numerical calculations are based on a Monte Carlo method for an incoherent mixture of non-interacting plane waves, and show that the atomic dynamics are highly sensitive to the initial momentum width of the gas. We explain this sensitivity by examining the time evolution of individual atomic centre of mass momentum eigenstates with varying quasimomentum, and we have determined analytic expressions for the evolution of the second-order momentum moment to illustrate the range of behaviours.",Human
"We present a simple measurement and analysis technique to determine the fraction of optical loss due to both radiation (scattering) and linear absorption in microphotonic components. The method is generally applicable to optical materials in which both nonlinear and linear absorption are present, and requires only limited knowledge of absolute optical power levels, material parameters, and the structure geometry. The technique is applied to high quality factor (Q=1-5 X 10^6) silicon-on-insulator microdisk resonators. It is determined that linear absorption can account for more than half the total optical loss in the high-Q regime of these devices.",Human
"We investigate efficient methods for packets to navigate in complex networks. The packets are assumed to have memory, but no previous knowledge of the graph. We assume the graph to be indexed, i.e. every vertex is associated with a number (accessible to the packets) between one and the size of the graph. We test different schemes to assign indices and utilize them in packet navigation. Four different network models with very different topological characteristics are used for testing the schemes. We find that one scheme outperform the others, and has an efficiency close to the theoretical optimum. We discuss the use of indexed-graph navigation in peer-to-peer networking and other distributed information systems.",Human
"Preliminary results from an optical-fiber gravitational wave interferometric detector are reported. The detector is very small, cheap and simple to build and operate. It is assembled from readily available opto-electronic components. A parts list is given. The detector can operate in two modes: one in which only instrument noise is detected, and data from a 24 hour period is reported for this mode, and in a 2nd mode in which the gravitational waves are detected as well, and data from a 24 hour period is analysed. Comparison shows that the instrument has a high S/N ratio. The frequency spectrum of the gravitational waves shows a pink noise spectrum, from 0 to 0.1Hz.",Human
"We study a three dimensional system of a rectangular-waveguide resonator with an inserted thin ferrite disk. The interplay of reflection and transmission at the disk interfaces together with material gyrotropy effect, gives rise to a rich variety of wave phenomena. We analyze the wave propagation based on full Maxwell-equation numerical solutions of the problem. We show that the power-flow lines of the microwave-cavity field interacting with a ferrite disk, in the proximity of its ferromagnetic resonance, form whirlpool-like electromagnetic vortices. Such vortices are characterized by the dynamical symmetry breaking. The role of ohmic losses in waveguide walls and dielectric and magnetic losses in a disk is a subject of our investigations.",Human
"We analyze, both analytically and numerically, the effectiveness of cloaking an infinite cylinder from observations by electromagnetic waves in three dimensions. We show that, as truncated approximations of the ideal permittivity and permeability tensors tend towards the singular ideal cloaking fields, so that the anisotropy ratio tends to infinity, the $D$ and $B$ fields blow up near the cloaking surface. We also consider cloaking with and without the SHS (soft-and-hard surface) lining. We demonstrate numerically that cloaking is significantly improved by the SHS lining, with both the far field of the scattered wave significantly reduced and the blow up of $D$ and $B$ prevented.",Human
"We study liquid-liquid dispersions in a turbulent Taylor - Couette flow, produced between two counterrotating coaxial cylinders. In pure Water and in counterrotation, Reynolds numbers up to 1.4 10^5 are reached. We first characterize the single-phase flow, in terms of threshold for transition to turbulence, scaling of the torque and measurements of the mean flow and of the Reynolds stress by stereoscopic PIV. We then study the increase of the dissipation in the two-phase flows and find that the torque per unit mass can be twice the torque for a single-phase flow. Long-time behaviours are also reported.",Human
"We find that a liquid jet can bounce off a bath of the same liquid if the bath is moving horizontally with respect to the jet. Previous observations of jets rebounding off a bath (e.g. Kaye effect) have been reported only for non-Newtonian fluids, while we observe bouncing jets in a variety of Newtonian fluids, including mineral oil poured by hand. A thin layer of air separates the bouncing jet from the bath, and the relative motion replenishes the film of air. Jets with one or two bounces are stable for a range of viscosity, jet flow rate and velocity, and bath velocity. The bouncing phenomenon exhibits hysteresis and multiple steady states.",Human
"Violation of Bell's Inequalities gives experimental evidence for the existence of a spin 1/2 which has two simultaneous axes of spin quantization rather than one. These couple to form a resonance state, called the spin fringe, and this quantum effect is solely responsible for violation of Bell's Inequalities within this model. The Bell states can be represented by products of these spin states and leads to the intuitive concept that as entangled states decompose they form biparticles that are not entangled. In EPR coincidence experiments filter settings for both the Bell and CHSH forms of Bell's Inequalities are rationalized in terms of the correlation between biparticles.",Human
"We propose an experiment which consists of drawing a card and using it to decide restrictions on the running of Large Hadron Collider (LHC for short) at CERN, such as luminosity, and beam energy. There may potentially occur total shut down. The purpose of such an experiment is to search for influence from the future, that is, backward causation. Since LHC will produce particles of a mathematically new type of fundamental scalars, i.e., the Higgs particles, there is potentially a chance to find unseen effects, such as on influence going from future to past, which we suggest in the present paper.",Human
"This work presents accurate ab initio determination of the hyperfine splitting for the ground state and few low-lying excited states of 113Cd+; important candidates for the frequency standard in the microwave region, using coupled-cluster theory (CC) in the relativistic framework. The calculated hyperfine splitting are well in agreement with recent experimental results. We have also carried out the lifetimes of the 5p2P1=2 and 5p2P3=2 states, which are in well agreement with recent experimental result (Moehring et al., PRA 73 023413, 2006). The roles of different electron correlation effects in the determination of these quantities are discussed and their contributions are presented in the CC terms.",Human
"One of the most useful measures of cluster quality is the modularity of a partition, which measures the difference between the number of the edges joining vertices from the same cluster and the expected number of such edges in a random (unstructured) graph. In this paper we show that the problem of finding a partition maximizing the modularity of a given graph G can be reduced to a minimum weighted cut problem on a complete graph with the same vertices as G. We then show that the resulted minimum cut problem can be efficiently solved with existing software for graph partitioning and that our algorithm finds clusterings of a better quality and much faster than the existing clustering algorithms.",Human
"In the present paper, we investigate the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from diatomic molecules with large internuclear distance using a strong field approximation (SFA) model. We find that the hump and dip structure emerges in the plateau region of the harmonic spectrum, and the location of this striking structure is sensitive to the laser intensity. Our model analysis reveals that two-center interference as well as the interference between different recombination electron trajectories are responsible for the unusual enhanced or suppressed harmonic yield at a certain order, and these interference effects are greatly influenced by the laser parameters such as intensity.",Human
"We present a fast and accurate method to calculate the electrostatic energy and forces of interacting particles with the boundary conditions appropriate to surfaces, i.e periodic in the two directions parallel to the surface and free in the perpendicular direction. In the spirit of the Ewald method the problem is divided into a short range and long range part. The charge density responsible for the long range part is represented by plane waves in the periodic directions and by finite elements in the non-periodic direction. Our method has computational complexity of O(N_g log(N_g)) with a very small prefactor, where N_g is the number of grid points.",Human
"Electrical charges generation occurring during contact and friction of insulating materials has been identified for a long time. However the contribution of these electrical charges to the friction behaviour is usually neglected in the energetical balances. Based on published results and on our own experimental results on the ability of the dielectric materials to trap charges, we show in this study that the interaction energy during friction depends markedly on these trapped charges. Eventually, we propose the complementary use of the ""mirror "" method and of surface forces measurements to obtain a quantitative evaluation of this contribution. dielectric behaviour / friction / triboelectrification / interfacial interactions / surface free energy / space charge / surface forces",Human
"We present a design improvement for a recently proposed type of Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor that uses a cylindrical (lenticular) lenslet array. The improved sensor design uses optical binning and requires significantly fewer detector pixels than the corresponding conventional or cylindrical Shack-Hartmann sensor, and so detector readout noise causes less signal degradation. Additionally, detector readout time is significantly reduced, which reduces the latency for closed loop systems, and data processing requirements. We provide simple analytical noise considerations and Monte-Carlo simulations, and show that the optically binned Shack-Hartmann sensor can offer better performance than the conventional counterpart in most practical situations, and our design is particularly suited for use with astronomical adaptive optics systems.",Human
"High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in the relativistic regime is employed to obtain zeptosecond pulses of $\gamma$-rays. The harmonics are generated from atomic systems in counterpropagating strong attosecond laser pulse trains of linear polarization. In this setup recollisions of the ionized electrons can be achieved in the highly relativistic regime via a reversal of the commonly deteriorating drift and without instability of the electron dynamics such as in a standing laser wave. As a result, coherent attosecond $\gamma$-rays in the 10 MeV energy range as well as coherent zeptosecond $\gamma$-ray pulses of MeV photon energy for time-resolved nuclear spectroscopy become feasible.",Human
"This paper deals with the triggering mechanism of the boiling crisis, a transition from nucleate to film boiling. We observe the boiling crisis in pool saturated boiling experimentally at nearly critical pressure to take advantage of the slowness of the bubble growth and of the smallness of the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) that defines the transition point. Such experiments require the reduced gravity conditions. Close to the CHF, the slow growth of the individual dry spots and their subsequent fusion on the transparent heater are observed through the latter. As discussed in the paper, these observations are consistent with numerical results obtained with the vapor recoil model of the boiling crisis.",Human
"By analyzing ``exact'' theoretical results from solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation of atoms in few-cycle laser pulses, we established the general conclusion that differential elastic scattering and photo-recombination cross sections of the target ion with {\em free} electrons can be extracted accurately from laser-generated high-energy electron momentum spectra and high-order harmonic spectra, respectively. Since both electron scattering and photoionization (the inverse of photo-recombination) are the conventional means for interrogating the structure of atoms and molecules, this result shows that existing few-cycle infrared lasers can be implemented for ultrafast imaging of transient molecules with temporal resolution of a few femtoseconds.",Human
"Single-molecule chemical reactions with individual single-walled carbon nanotubes were observed through near-infrared photoluminescence microscopy. The emission intensity within distinct submicrometer segments of single nanotubes changes in discrete steps after exposure to acid, base, or diazonium reactants. The steps are uncorrelated in space and time, and reflect the quenching of mobile excitons at localized sites of reversible or irreversible chemical attack. Analysis of step amplitudes reveals an exciton diffusional range of about 90 nanometers, independent of nanotube structure. Each exciton visits approximately 104 atomic sites during its lifetime, providing highly efficient sensing of local chemical and physical perturbations.",Human
"Lifetimes of the first two metastable states in Sc^{2+} and Y^{2+} are determined using the relativistic coupled-cluster theory. There is a considerable interest in studying the electron correlation effects in these ions as though their electronic configurations are similar to the neutral alkali atoms, their structures are very different from the latter. We have made a comparative study of the correlation trends between the above doubly ionized systems with their corresponding neutral and singly ionized iso-electronic systems. The lifetimes of the excited states of these ions are very important in the field of astrophysics, especially for the study of post-main sequence evolution of the cool giant stars.",Human
"In the present work we investigate the multiscale nature of the correlations for high frequency data (1 minute) in different futures markets over a period of two years, starting on the 1st of January 2003 and ending on the 31st of December 2004. In particular, by using the concept of ""local"" Hurst exponent, we point out how the behaviour of this parameter, usually considered as a benchmark for persistency/antipersistency recognition in time series, is largely time-scale dependent in the market context. These findings are a direct consequence of the intrinsic complexity of a system where trading strategies are scale-adaptive. Moreover, our analysis points out different regimes in the dynamical behaviour of the market indices under consideration.",Human
"Obtaining more accurate equity value estimates is the starting point for stock selection, value-based indexing in a noisy market, and beating benchmark indices through tactical style rotation. Unfortunately, discounted cash flow, method of comparables, and fundamental analysis typically yield discrepant valuation estimates. Moreover, the valuation estimates typically disagree with market price. Can one form a superior valuation estimate by averaging over the individual estimates, including market price? This article suggests a Bayesian framework for combining two or more estimates into a superior valuation estimate. The framework justifies the common practice of averaging over several estimates to arrive at a final point estimate.",Human
"In this article we study the effects of higher body excitations in the relativistic CC calculations for atoms and ions with one valence electron using Fock-space CCSD, CCSD(T) and its unitary variants. The present study demonstrates that CCSD(T) estimates the ionization potentials (IPs) and the valence electron removal energies quite accurately for alkali atoms and singly ionized alkaline earth ions, but yields unphysical energy levels for atoms and/or ions with partially filled sub-shell like C II. We further demonstrate that the higher body excitation effects can be incorporated more effectively through the unitary coupled cluster theory (UCC) compared to the CCSD(T) method.",Human
"Using first-principles density functional calculations, we have studied the magnetic ordering in pure Mn$_n$ ($n=2-$10, 13, 15, 19) and As@Mn$_n$ ($n=1-$10) clusters. Although, for both pure and doped manganese clusters, there exists many collinear and noncollinear isomers close in energy, the smaller clusters with $n\leqslant$5 have collinear magnetic ground state and the emergence of noncollinear ground states is seen for $n\geqslant$6 clusters. Due to strong $p-d$ hybridization in As@Mn$_n$ clusters, the binding energy is substantially enhanced and the magnetic moment is reduced compared to the corresponding pure Mn$_n$ clusters.",Human
"The structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Co$_n$ clusters ($n=2-$20) have been investigated using density functional theory within the pseudopotential plane wave method. An unusual hexagonal growth pattern has been observed in the intermediate size range, $n=15-$20. The cobalt atoms are ferromagnetically ordered and the calculated magnetic moments are found to be higher than that of corresponding hcp bulk value, which are in good agreement with the recent Stern-Gerlach experiments. The average coordination number is found to dominate over the average bond length to determine the effective hybridization and consequently the cluster magnetic moment.",Human
Quantum projection noise will soon limit the best achievable precision of optical atomic clocks based on lattice-confined neutral atoms. Squeezing the collective atomic pseudo-spin via measurement of the clock state populations during Ramsey interrogation suppresses the projection noise. We show here that the lattice laser field can be used to perform ideal quantum non-demolition measurements without clock shifts or decoherence and explore the feasibility of such an approach in theory with the lattice field confined in a ring-resonator. Detection of the motional sideband due to the atomic vibration in the lattice wells can yield signal sizes a hundredfold above the projection noise limit.,Human
"The contributions of neutrons to hadronic signals from the DREAM calorimeter are measured by analyzing the time structure of these signals. The neutrons, which mainly originate from the evaporation stage of nuclear breakup in the hadronic shower development process, contribute through elastic scattering off protons in the plastic scintillating fibers which provide the $dE/dx$ information in this calorimeter. This contribution is characterized by an exponential tail in the pulse shape, with a time constant of $\sim 25$ ns. The relative contribution of neutrons to the signals increases with the distance from the shower axis. As expected, the neutrons do not contribute to the DREAM \v{C}erenkov signals.",Human
"Results are presented of beam tests in which a small electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of lead tungstate crystals was exposed to 50 GeV electrons and pions. This calorimeter was backed up by the DREAM Dual-Readout calorimeter, which measures the scintillation and \v{C}erenkov light produced in the shower development, using two different media. The signals from the crystal calorimeter were analyzed in great detail in an attempt to determine the contributions from these two types of light to the signals, event by event. This information makes it possible to eliminate the dominating source of fluctuations and thus achieve an important improvement in hadronic calorimeter performance.",Human
"We consider local leaders in random uncorrelated networks, i.e. nodes whose degree is higher or equal than the degree of all of their neighbors. An analytical expression is found for the probability of a node of degree $k$ to be a local leader. This quantity is shown to exhibit a transition from a situation where high degree nodes are local leaders to a situation where they are not when the tail of the degree distribution behaves like the power-law $\sim k^{-\gamma_c}$ with $\gamma_c=3$. Theoretical results are verified by computer simulations and the importance of finite-size effects is discussed.",Human
The usual development of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) assumes that jumps and time intervals are a two-dimensional set of independent and identically distributed random variables. In this paper we address the theoretical setting of non-independent CTRW's where consecutive jumps and/or time intervals are correlated. An exact solution to the problem is obtained for the special but relevant case in which the correlation solely depends on the signs of consecutive jumps. Even in this simple case some interesting features arise such as transitions from unimodal to bimodal distributions due to correlation. We also develop the necessary analytical techniques and approximations to handle more general situations that can appear in practice.,Human
"We demonstrate a simple method to improve the Lewenstein model for the description of high-order harmonic generation (HHG). It is shown that HHG spectra can be expressed as the product of a returning electron wave packet and the photo-recombination cross sections, where the former can be extracted from the Lewenstein model. By replacing plane waves with scattering waves in the calculation of recombination matrix elements, we showed that the resulting HHG spectra agree well with those from solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. The improved model can be used for quantitative calculations of high harmonics generated by molecules.",Human
"InGaAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are convenient for single photon detection in the near-infrared (NIR) including the fibre communication bands (1.31/1.55 $\mu$m). However, to suppress afterpulse noise due to trapped avalanche charge, they must be gated with MHz repetition frequencies, thereby severely limiting the count rate in NIR applications. Here we show gating frequencies for InGaAs-APDs well beyond 1 GHz. Using a self-differencing technique to sense much weaker avalanches, we reduce drastically afterpulse noise. At 1.25 GHz, we obtain a detection efficiency of 10.8% with an afterpulse probability of 6.16%. In addition, the detector features low jitter (55 ps) and a count rate of 100 MHz.",Human
"Bilateral trade relationships in the international level between pairs of countries in the world give rise to the notion of the International Trade Network (ITN). This network has attracted the attention of network researchers as it serves as an excellent example of the weighted networks, the link weight being defined as a measure of the volume of trade between two countries. In this paper we analyzed the international trade data for 53 years and studied in detail the variations of different network related quantities associated with the ITN. Our observation is that the ITN has also a scale invariant structure like many other real-world networks.",Human
"The g index was introduced by Leo Egghe as an improvement of Hirsch's index h for measuring the overall citation record of a set of articles. It better takes into account the highly skewed frequency distribution of citations than the h index. I propose to sharpen this g index by excluding the self-citations. I have worked out nine practical cases in physics and compare the h and g values with and without self-citations. As expected, the g index characterizes the data set better than the h index. The influence of the self-citations appears to be more significant for the g index than for the h index.",Human
"The design of a 671 nm diode laser with a mode-hop-free tuning range of 40 GHz is described. This long tuning range is achieved by simultaneously ramping the external cavity length with the laser injection current. The external cavity consists of a microscope cover slip mounted on piezoelectric actuators. In such a configuration the laser output pointing remains fixed, independent of its frequency. Using a diode with an output power of 5-7 mW, the laser linewidth was found to be smaller than 30 MHz. This cover slip cavity and feedforward laser current control system is simple, economical, robust, and easy to use for spectroscopy, as we demonstrate with lithium vapor and lithium atom beam experiments.",Human
"A set of fluid equations, taking into account the spin properties of the electrons and positrons in a magnetoplasma, are derived. The magnetohydrodynamic limit of the pair plasma is investigated. It is shown that the microscopic spin properties of the electrons and positrons can lead to interesting macroscopic and collective effects in strongly magnetized plasmas. In particular, it is found that new Alfvenic solitary structures, governed by a modified Korteweg-de Vries equation, are allowed in such plasmas. These solitary structures vanish if the quantum spin effects are neglected. Our results should be of relevance for astrophysical plasmas, e.g. in pulsar magnetospheres.",Human
"Both ecological systems and convective fluid systems are examples of open systems which operate far-from-equilibrium. This article demonstrates that there is a correspondence between a resource-consumer chemostat ecosystem and the Rayleigh-Benard (RB) convective fluid system. The Lorenz dynamics of the RB system can be translated into an ecosystem dynamics. Not only is there a correspondence between the dynamical equations, also the physical interpretations show interesting analogies. By using this fluid-ecosystem analogy, we are able to derive the correct value of the size of convection rolls by competitive fitness arguments borrowed from ecology. We finally conjecture that the Lorenz dynamics can be extended to describe more complex convection patterns that resemble ecological predation.",Human
"The ground-state hyperfine splitting values of high-Z boronlike ions are calculated. Calculation of the interelectronic-interaction contribution is based on a combination of the 1/Z perturbation theory and the large-scale configuration-interaction Dirac-Fock-Sturm method. The screened QED corrections are evaluated utilizing an effective screening potential approach. Total hyperfine splitting energies are presented for several B-like ions of particular interest: {}^{45}Sc{}^{16+}, {}^{57}Fe{}^{21+}, {}^{207}Pb{}^{77+}, and {}^{209}Bi{}^{78+}. For lead and bismuth the experimental values of the 1s hyperfine splitting are employed to improve significantly the theoretical results by reducing the uncertainty due to the nuclear effects.",Human
"The observation of dark-resonances in the two-electron atom barium and their influence on optical cooling is reported. In heavy alkali earth atoms, i.e. barium or radium, optical cooling can be achieved using n^1S_0-n^1P_1 transitions and optical repumping from the low lying n^1D_2 and n^3D_{1,2} states to which the atoms decay with a high branching ratio. The cooling and repumping transition have a common upper state. This leads to dark resonances and hence make optical cooling less inefficient. The experimental observations can be accurately modelled by the optical Bloch equations. Comparison with experimental results allows us to extract relevant parameters for effective laser cooling of barium.",Human
"We present rigorous results for quantum systems with both bound and continuum states subjected to an arbitrary strength time-periodic field. We prove that the wave function takes the form of a sum of time-periodic resonant states with complex quasi-energies and dispersive part of the the solution given by a power series in t^{-1/2}. Generally, the imaginary part of each resonance is negative, leading to ionization of the atom, but we also give examples where the ionization rate is zero implying the existence of a time-periodic Floquet bound state. The complex quasi-energy has a convergent perturbation expansion for small field strengths.",Human
"We present the first measurements of the electroluminescence response to the emission of single electrons in a two-phase noble gas detector. Single ionization electrons generated in liquid xenon are detected in a thin gas layer during the 31-day background run of the ZEPLIN-II experiment, a two-phase xenon detector for WIMP dark matter searches. Both the pressure dependence and magnitude of the single-electron response are in agreement with previous measurements of electroluminescence yield in xenon. We discuss different photoionization processes as possible cause for the sample of single electrons studied in this work. This observation may have implications for the design and operation of future large-scale two-phase systems.",Human
"We study the co-evolution of network structure and node states in a model of multiple state interacting agents. The system displays two transitions, network recombination and fragmentation, governed by time scales that emerge from the dynamics. The recombination transition separates a frozen configuration, composed by disconnected network components whose agents share the same state, from an active configuration, with a fraction of links that are continuously being rewired. The nature of this transition is explained analytically as the maximum of a characteristic time. The fragmentation transition, that appears between two absorbing frozen phases, is an anomalous order-disorder transition, governed by a crossover between the time scales that control the structure and state dynamics.",Human
"Modelling incompressible ideal fluids as a finite collection of vortex filaments is important in physics (super-fluidity, models for the onset of turbulence) as well as for numerical algorithms used in computer graphics for the real time simulation of smoke. Here we introduce a time-discrete evolution equation for arbitrary closed polygons in 3-space that is a discretisation of the localised induction approximation of filament motion. This discretisation shares with its continuum limit the property that it is a completely integrable system. We apply this polygon evolution to a significant improvement of the numerical algorithms used in Computer Graphics.",Human
"It is shown that elastic resonance scattering of light by a finite-size obstacle with weak dissipation is analogous to quantum scattering by a potential with quasi-discrete levels and exhibits Fano resonances. Localized plasmons (polaritons), exited in the obstacle by the incident light, are equivalent to the quasi-discrete levels, while the radiative decay of these excitations plays exactly the same role as tunnelling from the quasi-discrete levels for the quantum problem. Mie scattering of light by a spherical particle and an exactly solvable discrete model with nonlocal coupling simulating wave scattering in systems with reduced spatial dimensionality are discussed as examples.",Human
"An earlier finding that the van der waals radii are related to their de broglie wavelengths for some non-metallic elements has been extended here to show that in fact, they vary linearly with the ground state bohr radii for all the elements of groups 1a to 8 a. Similarly, the valence shell radii and the covalent radii are shown to be linearly dependent on the bohr radii. One table of data and 5 figures have been provided here showing that all the above radii are sums of two lengths, one of which is a multiple of the bohr radius and the other, a positive or negative constant for each group of elements.",Human
"Recently, Feigel has predicted a new effect in magnetoelectric media. The theoretical evaluation of this effect requires a careful analysis of a dynamics of the moving magnetoelectric medium and, in particular, the derivation of the energy-momentum of the electromagnetic field in such a medium. Then, one can proceed with the study of the wave propagation in this medium and derive the mechanical quantities such as the energy, the momentum, and their fluxes and the corresponding forces. In this paper, we develop a consistent general-relativistic variational approach to the moving dielectric and magnetic medium with and without magnetoelectric properties. The old experiments in which the light pressure was measured in fluids are reanalysed in our new framework.",Human
"We study the United States Congress by constructing networks between Members of Congress based on the legislation that they cosponsor. Using the concept of modularity, we identify the community structure of Congressmen, as connected via sponsorship/cosponsorship of the same legislation, to investigate the collaborative communities of legislators in both chambers of Congress. This analysis yields an explicit and conceptually clear measure of political polarization, demonstrating a sharp increase in partisan polarization which preceded and then culminated in the 104th Congress (1995-1996), when Republicans took control of both chambers. Although polarization has since waned in the U.S. Senate, it remains at historically high levels in the House of Representatives.",Human
"The off-resonant hyperpolarizability is calculated using the dipole-free sum-over-stats expression from a randomly chosen set of energies and transition dipole moments that are forced to be consistent with the sum rules. The process is repeated so that the distribution of hyperpolarizabilities can be determined. We find this distribution to be a cycloid-like function. In contrast to variational techniques that when applied to the potential energy function yield an intrinsic hyperpolarizability less than 0.71, our Monte Carlo method yields values that approach unity. While many transition dipole moments are large when the calculated hyperpolarizability is near the fundamental limit, only two excited states dominate the hyperpolarizability - consistent with the three-level ansatz.",Human
"In this paper we study the relaxation singularities of human motor system at aging. Our purpose is to examine the structure of force output variability as a function of human aging in the time and frequency domains. For analysis of experimental data we have developed here the statistical theory of relaxation of force output fluctuation with taking into account the effects of two relaxation channels. The first of them contains the contribution of short-range correlation whereas other relaxation component reflects the effect of long-range correlation. The analysis of experimental data shows, that the general behavior of relaxation processes at human aging is determined by a complicated combination and nonlinear interactions two above stated relaxation processes as a whole.",Human
"We report the observation of capillary wave turbulence on the surface of a fluid layer in a low-gravity environment. In such conditions, the fluid covers all the internal surface of the spherical container which is submitted to random forcing. The surface wave amplitude displays power-law spectrum over two decades in frequency, corresponding to wavelength from $mm$ to a few $cm$. This spectrum is found in roughly good agreement with wave turbulence theory. Such a large scale observation without gravity waves has never been reached during ground experiments. When the forcing is periodic, two-dimensional spherical patterns are observed on the fluid surface such as subharmonic stripes or hexagons with wavelength satisfying the capillary wave dispersion relation.",Human
"We demonstrate for the first time a mid infrared silicon Raman amplifier. Amplification of 12 dB is reported for a signal at 3.39 micron wavelength. The active medium was a 2.5 cm long silicon sample that was pumped with 5ns pulses at 2.88 micron. The absence of the nonlinear losses which severely limit the performance of silicon Raman devices in the near infrared combined with unsurpassed crystal quality, high thermal conductivity render silicon a very attractive Raman medium. Such a technology can potentially extend silicon photonics application beyond data communication in the near infrared and into the mid infrared world of remote sensing, biochemical detection and laser medicine.",Human
"The Pockels effect can increase the effective birefringence of ambichiral, electro--optic rejection filters made of materials with a $\bar{4}2m$ point group symmetry, when a dc electric field is applied parallel to the axis of nonhomogeneity. The reflectances and the transmittances of such an ambichiral structure for obliquely incident plane waves is solvable through a boundary-value problem that is formulated using the frequency-domain Maxwell equations, the constitutive equations that contain the Pockels effect, and standard algebraic techniques for handling 4x4 matrix ordinary differential equations. The Bragg resonance peaks, for different circular-polarized-incidence conditions, blueshift as the angle of incidence increases. These blueshifts are unaffected by the sign of the dc electric field.",Human
"We derive the properties of polaritons in single-$\Lambda$ and double-$\Lambda$ media using a microscopic equation-of-motion technique. In each case, the polaritonic dispersion relation and composition arise from a matrix eigenvalue problem for arbitrary control field strengths. We show that the double-$\Lambda$ medium can be used to up- or down-convert single photons while preserving quantum coherence. The existence of a dark-state polariton protects this single-photon four-wave mixing effect against incoherent decay of the excited atomic states. The efficiency of this conversion is limited mainly by the sample size and the lifetime of the metastable state.",Human
"This paper describes a design of a molecular propagation system in molecular communication. Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm where biological and artificially-created nanomachines communicate over a short distance using molecules. A molecular propagation system in molecular communication directionally transports molecules from a sender to a receiver. In the design described in this paper, protein filaments glide over immobilized motor proteins along preconfigured microlithographic tracks, and the gliding protein filaments carry and transport molecules from a sender to a receiver. In the design, DNA hybridization is used to load and unload the molecules onto and from the carriers at a sender and a receiver. In the design, loading/transporting/unloading processes are autonomous and require no external control.",Human
"This paper presents a molecular mechanics study using a molecular dynamics software (NAMD) coupled to virtual reality (VR) techniques for intuitive Bio-NanoRobotic prototyping. Using simulated Bio-Nano environments in VR, the operator can design and characterize through physical simulation and 3-D visualization the behavior of Bio-NanoRobotic components and structures. The main novelty of the proposed simulations is based on the characterization of stiffness performances of passive joints-based deca-alanine protein molecule and active joints-based viral protein motor (VPL) in their native environment. Their use as elementary Bio-NanoRobotic components (1 dof platform) are also simulated and the results discussed.",Human
"Measurement of the transmitted intensity from a coherent monomode light source through a series of subwavelength slit arrays in Ag films, with varying array pitch and number of slits, demonstrate enhancement (suppression) by as much as a factor of 6 (9) when normalized to that of an isolated slit. Pronounced minima in the transmitted intensity were observed at array pitches corresponding to lambda_SPP, 2lambda_SPP, and 3lambda_SPP where lambda_SPP is the wavelength of the surface plasmon polariton (SPP). Increasing the number of slits to more than four does not increase appreciably the per-slit transmission intensity. These results are consistent with a model for interference between SPPs and the incident wave that fits well the measured transmitted intensity profile.",Human
"Three-dimensional, time-dependent numerical simulations of the dynamics of magnetic flux ropes are presented. The simulations are targeted towards an experiment previously conducted at CalTech (Bellan, P. M. and J. F. Hansen, Phys. Plasmas, 5, 1991 (1998)) which aimed at simulating Solar prominence eruptions in the laboratory. The plasma dynamics is described by ideal MHD using different models for the evolution of the mass density. Key features of the reported experimental observations like pinching of the current loop, its expansion and distortion into helical shape are reproduced in the numerical simulations. Details of the final structure depend on the choice of a specific model for the mass density.",Human
"Earlier, the linear magnetoelectric effect of chromium sesquioxide Cr_2 O_3 has been determined experimentally as a function of temperature. One measures the electric field-induced magnetization on Cr_2 O_3 crystals or the magnetic field-induced polarization. From the magnetoelectric moduli of Cr_2 O_3 we extract a 4-dimensional relativistic invariant pseudoscalar \tilde\alpha. It is temperature dependent and of the order of ~ 10^{-4} Y_0, with Y_0 as vacuum admittance. We show that the new pseudoscalar \tilde\alpha is odd under parity transformation and odd under time inversion. Moreover, \tilde\alpha is for Cr_2 O_3 what Tellegen's gyrator is for two port theory, the axion field for axion electrodynamics, and the PEMC (perfect electromagnetic conductor) for electrical engineering.",Human
"We investigate Kerr-Newman black holes in which a rotating charged ring-shaped singularity induces a region which contains closed timelike curves (CTCs). Contrary to popular belief, it turns out that the time orientation of the CTC is opposite to the direction in which the singularity or the ergosphere rotates. In this sense, CTCs ""counter-rotate"" against the rotating black hole. We have similar results for all spacetimes sufficiently familiar to us in which rotation induces CTCs. This motivates our conjecture that perhaps this counter-rotation is not an accidental oddity particular to Kerr-Newman spacetimes, but instead there may be a general and intuitively comprehensible reason for this.",Human
"We analyze a collaboration network based on the Marvel Universe comic books. First, we consider the system as a binary network, where two characters are connected if they appear in the same publication. The analysis of degree correlations reveals that, in contrast to most real social networks, the Marvel Universe presents a disassortative mixing on the degree. Then, we use a weight measure to study the system as a weighted network. This allows us to find and characterize well defined communities. Through the analysis of the community structure and the clustering as a function of the degree we show that the network presents a hierarchical structure. Finally, we comment on possible mechanisms responsible for the particular motifs observed.",Human
"Author offers the new and distinctly revolutionary method of levitation in artificial magnetic field. It is shown that a very big space station and small satellites may be suspended over the Earth's surface and used as motionless radio-TV translators, telecommunication boosters, absolute geographic position locators, personal and mass entertainment and as planet-observation platforms. Presented here is the theory of big AB artificial magnetic field and levitation in it is generally developed. Computation of three macro-projects: space station at altitude 100 km, TV-communication antenna at height 500 m, and multi-path magnetic highway.   Key words: levitation, AB Levitrons, motionless space satellite.",Human
"Discussion of the constancy, or otherwise, of the various so-called universal constants which abound in physics has continued for many years. However, relatively recent observations, which appear to indicate a variation in the value of the fine structure constant, have reignited the subject. These observations relate to quasars and that in itself raises questions. Also, since many of the arguments utilise the Bekenstein-Hawking expression for the entropy of a black hole, further controversy is introduced into the discussion immediately. In what follows these two points will be examined and some less well-known theoretical considerations introduced which, hopefully, will instigate wider examination of this topic.",Human
"We have defined a slowness, s, as the reciprocal conjugate of velocity, v. s = -ih/v. We have shown that Einstein's postulate (v has an upper limit) implies that s is discrete. A velocity operator is defined as the derivative with respect to s. Superposition of corresponding Eigenfunctions give Galilean law of addition of velocities. We have replaced the differential operator by the corresponding finite difference symmetric operator. We have shown that superposition of corresponding discrete Eigenfunctions give relativistic law of addition of velocities. A reciprocal symmetric number system is developed and with the help of this number system we have shown the relation between superposition and relativistic law of addition of velocities.",Human
"The network properties of a graph ensemble subject to the constraints imposed by the expected degree sequence are studied. It is found that the linear preferential attachment is a fundamental rule, as it keeps the maximal entropy in sparse growing networks. This provides theoretical evidence in support of the linear preferential attachment widely exists in real networks and adopted as a crucial assumption in growing network models. Besides, in the sparse limit, we develop a method to calculate the degree correlation and clustering coefficient in our ensemble model, which is suitable for all kinds of sparse networks including the BA model, proposed by Barabasi and Albert.",Human
"We report the statistical properties of three bus-transport networks (BTN) in three different cities of China. These networks are composed of a set of bus lines and stations serviced by these. Network properties, including the degree distribution, clustering and average path length are studied in different definitions of network topology. We explore scaling laws and correlations that may govern intrinsic features of such networks. Besides, we create a weighted network representation for BTN with lines mapped to nodes and number of common stations to weights between lines. In such a representation, the distributions of degree, strength and weight are investigated. A linear behavior between strength and degree s(k) ~ k is also observed.",Human
"Structural properties of the ship-transport network of China (STNC) are studied in the light of recent investigations of complex networks. STNC is composed of a set of routes and ports located along the sea or river. Network properties including the degree distribution, degree correlations, clustering, shortest path length, centrality and betweenness are studied in different definition of network topology. It is found that geographical constraint plays an important role in the network topology of STNC. We also study the traffic flow of STNC based on the weighted network representation, and demonstrate the weight distribution can be described by power law or exponential function depending on the assumed definition of network topology. Other features related to STNC are also investigated.",Human
"Superresolution, extraordinary transmission, total absorption, and localization of electromagnetic waves are currently attracting growing attention. These phenomena are related to different physical objects and are usually studied within the context of different, sometimes rather sophisticated, physical approaches. Remarkably, all these seemingly unrelated phenomena owe their origin to the same underlying physical mechanism - wave interaction with an open resonator. Here we show that it is possible to describe all of these effects in a unified way, mapping each system onto a simple resonator model. Such description provides a thorough understanding of the phenomena, explains all the main features of their complex behaviour, and enables to control the system via the resonator parameters: eigenfrequencies, Q-factors, and coupling coefficients.",Human
"This paper defines an equation for causality. This equation is then combined with the postulates of quantum mechanics and mass-energy equivalence to produce a quantum mechanical telegrapher's equation and to reproduce the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and dynamic general equilibrium in economics (with an interpretation of a Nash equilibrium) are obtained when the equation of causality refers to itself, i.e. when the cause is its own effect. As it is shown that the Klein-Gordon equation is obtained by Wick rotating the cause vector with de Broglie angular frequency, this paper postulates an equation for Quantum Gravity, which relates the Navier-Stokes equations to the Einstein Field Equations of General Relativity.",Human
"The transformation converting equations invariant under Lorentz into the equations invariant under Galileo is obtained. On this basis: (1) the super-light electromagnetic wave with longitudinal and transversal modes is found out; (2) it is shown the wave velocity coincides with that of de Broglie's wave; (3) the connection between Maxwell's electrodynamics and Shredinger's equation is established; (4) structural elements of space are discovered and ""a horizon of visibility"" is found. It is shown Bell's inequalities and the principle of the light speed constancy are based on the SRT artifact and ""Einstein's local realism"" is determined by the wave referred above. Objectivity of results for quantum and classical objects is discussed",Human
"In order to extend the tracking acceptance, to improve the primary and secondary vertex reconstruction and thus enhancing the tagging capabilities for short lived particles, the ZEUS experiment at the HERA Collider at DESY installed a silicon strip vertex detector. The barrel part of the detector is a 63 cm long cylinder with silicon sensors arranged around an elliptical beampipe. The forward part consists of four circular shaped disks. In total just over 200k channels are read out using $2.9 {\rm m^2}$ of silicon. In this report a detailed overview of the design and construction of the detector is given and the performance of the completed system is reviewed.",Human
"High-order harmonic generation from atomic systems is considered in the crossed fields of a relativistically strong infrared laser and a weak attosecond-pulse train of soft x-rays. Due to one-photon ionization by the x-ray pulse, the ionized electron obtains a starting momentum that compensates the relativistic drift which is induced by the laser magnetic field, and allows the electron to efficiently emit harmonic radiation upon recombination with the atomic core in the relativistic regime. In this way, short pulses of coherent hard x-rays of up to 40 keV energy and 10 as duration can be brought about.",Human
"The interaction of a point charge and a magnetic moment (and by extension a point charge and a solenoid) is explored within well-defined point-charge magnetic-moment models where full calculations are possible. It is shown explicitly how the ""hidden mechanical momentum"" is introduced by the ""hidden"" external forces of constraint, requiring a prescribed response (through order 1/c^2) of the system to electromagnetic forces. These external forces often go unmentioned in the textbook and research literature. The dependence of ""hidden mechanical momentum"" upon detailed external (nonelectromagnetic) forces may undermine the idea's usefulness in describing nature. Some statements of dubious validity in the textbook literature are noted.",Human
"An event reweighting technique incorporated in multivariate training algorithm has been developed and tested using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Boosted Decision Trees (BDT). The event reweighting training are compared to that of the conventional equal event weighting based on the ANN and the BDT performance. The comparison is performed in the context of the physics analysis of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which will explore the fundamental nature of matter and the basic forces that shape our universe. We demonstrate that the event reweighting technique provides an unbiased method of multivariate training for event pattern recognition.",Human
"Optical trapping of selected species of radioactive atoms has great potential in precision measurements for testing fundamental physics such as EDM, PNC and parity violating beta-decay asymmetry correlation coefficients. We report trapping of 10^4 radioactive ^{82}Rb atoms (t_{1/2}=75 s) with a trap lifetime of ~55 seconds in an optical dipole trap. Transfer efficiency from the magneto-optical trap was ~14%. We further report the evidence of spontaneous spin polarization of the atoms in optical dipole trap loading. This advancement is an important step towards a new generation of precision J-beta correlations measurements with polarized ^{82}Rb atoms.",Human
"The method of self-similar factor approximants is completed by defining the approximants of odd orders, constructed from the power series with the largest term of an odd power. It is shown that the method provides good approximations for transcendental functions. In some cases, just a few terms in a power series make it possible to reconstruct a transcendental function exactly. Numerical convergence of the factor approximants is checked for several examples. A special attention is paid to the possibility of extrapolating the behavior of functions, with arguments tending to infinity, from the related asymptotic series at small arguments. Applications of the method are thoroughly illustrated by the examples of several functions, nonlinear differential equations, and anharmonic models.",Human
"We present measurements of fluid particle accelerations in turbulent water flows between counter-rotating disks using three-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking. By simultaneously following multiple particles with sub-Kolmogorov-time-scale temporal resolution, we measured the spatial correlation of fluid particle acceleration at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers between 200 and 690. We also obtained indirect, non-intrusive measurements of the Eulerian pressure structure functions by integrating the acceleration correlations. Our experimental data provide strong support to the theoretical predictions of the acceleration correlations and the pressure structure function in isotropic high Reynolds number turbulence by Obukhov and Yaglom in 1951. The measured pressure structure functions display K41 scaling in the inertial range.",Human
"By tracking small particles in the bulk of an intensely turbulent flow, we show that even a very small concentration of long-chain polymers disrupts the usual turbulent energy cascade. The polymers affect scales much larger than their physical size, from the dissipation range to the inertial range. The effect depends strongly on the polymer concentration. While the dissipative-scale statistics change continuously as the polymer concentration is increased, the inertial-range energy transfer rate is only altered by the polymer additives when the concentration is above a threshold (approximately 5 parts per million by weight for the polymer we used).",Human
"Nonlinear properties of Surface Plasmon Polaritons stemming from the inherent electron plasma nonlinearity of the metal layers are investigated. A fluid-mechanics plasma model is used to describe the electron motion in metals. The nonlinear ponderomotive force repels the electrons from the high field intensity region, effectively reducing the local plasma frequency and the corresponding real part of the refractive index results in Kerr like self-focusing. The field confinement to the low carrier density region also assists also in reducing the propagation losses, which usually inhibit practical nanoplasmonic circuits. Surface plasmon self focusing and nonlinear spectrum modifications, predicted by our model, are demonstrated by preliminary experiments.",Human
"We image spatial distributions of Xe$^{q+}$ ions in the focus of a laser beam of ultrashort, intense pulses in all three dimensions, with a resolution of $\sim$3 $\mu$m and $\sim$12 $\mu$m in the two transverse directions. This allows for studying ionization processes without spatially averaging ion yields. Our \emph{in situ} ion imaging is also useful to analyze focal intensity profiles and to investigate the transverse modal purity of tightly focused beams of complex light. As an example, the intensity profile of a Hermite-Gaussian beam mode HG$_{1,0}$ recorded with ions is found to be in good agreement with optical images.",Human
"Investigating the causes of the nonlinear behavior of a gaseous conductor we identified the presence of two states of the complex space charge configuration self-assembled in front of the anode. These states correspond to two levels of self-organization from which the first one is related to spatial pattern whereas the second one to spatiotemporal pattern. Their emergence through two kinds of instabilities produced for two critical distances from thermodynamic equilibrium is emphasized in the current voltage characteristic as an S-shaped, respectively Z-shaped bistability. Their presence attributes to the gaseous conductor the ability to work as an S-shaped, respectively an N-shaped negative differential resistance.",Human
"The interface between classical physics and quantum physics is explained from the point of view of quantum information theory (Feynman Processes). The interpretation depends on a hefty sacrifice: the classical determinism or the arrow of time.   The wave-particle duality steams from the qubit model, as the root of creation and annihilation of possibilities. A few key experiments are briefly reviewed from the above perspective: quantum erasure, delayed-choice and wave-particle correlation.   The CPT-Theorem is interpreted in the framework of categories with duality and a timeless interpretation of the Feynman Processes is proposed. A connection between the fine-structure constant and algebraic number theory is suggested.",Human
"The zeroth theorem of the history of science (enunciated by E. P. Fischer) and widely known in the mathematics community as Arnol'd's Principle (decreed by M. V. Berry), states that a discovery (rule, regularity, insight) named after someone (often) did not originate with that person. I present five examples from physics: the Lorentz condition defining the Lorentz gauge of the electromagnetic potentials; the Dirac delta function (x); the Schumann resonances of the earth-ionosphere cavity; the Weizsacker-Williams method of virtual quanta; the BMT equation of spin dynamics. I give illustrated thumbnail sketches of both the true and reputed discoverers and quote from their ""discovery"" publications.",Human
"The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is one of the most popular games of the Game Theory due to the emergence of cooperation among competitive rational players. In this paper, we present the PD played in cells of one-dimension cellular automata, where the number of possible neighbors that each cell interacts, z, can vary. This makes possible to retrieve results obtained previously in regular lattices. Exhaustive exploration of the parameters space is presented. We show that the final state of the system is governed mainly by the number of neighbors z and there is a drastic difference if it is even or odd.",Human
"In viscous withdrawal, a converging flow imposed in an upper layer of viscous liquid entrains liquid from a lower, stably stratified layer. Using the idea that a thin tendril is entrained by a local straining flow, we propose a scaling law for the volume flux of liquid entrained from miscible liquid layers. A long-wavelength model including only local information about the withdrawal flow is degenerate, with multiple tendril solutions for one withdrawal condition. Including information about the global geometry of the withdrawal flow removes the degeneracy while introducing only a logarithmic dependence on the global flow parameters into the scaling law.",Human
"Urban streets patterns form planar networks whose empirical properties cannot be accounted for by simple models such as regular grids or Voronoi tesselations. Striking statistical regularities across different cities have been recently empirically found, suggesting that a general and details-independent mechanism may be in action. We propose a simple model based on a local optimization process combined with ideas previously proposed in studies of leaf pattern formation. The statistical properties of this model are in good agreement with the observed empirical patterns. Our results thus suggests that in the absence of a global design strategy, the evolution of many different transportation networks indeed follow a simple universal mechanism.",Human
"We propose an accurate and efficient method to compute vibrational spectra of molecules, based on exact diagonalization of an algebraically calculated matrix based on powers of Morse coordinate. The present work focuses on the 1D potential of diatomic molecules: as typical examples, we apply this method to the standard Lennard-Jones oscillator, and to the ab initio potential of the H2 molecule. Global cm-1 accuracy is exhibited through the H2 spectrum, obtained through the diagonalization of a 30 x 30 matrix. This theory is at the root of a new method to obtain globally accurate vibrational spectral data in the context of the multi-dimensional potential of polyatomic molecules, at an affordable computational cost.",Human
"A major source of delays in public transportation is the clustering instability, which causes late buses to become progressively later while the buses trailing it become progressively earlier. In this paper, we study this instability and how to neutralize it using the common practices of holding and schedule slack. Starting with an on-time route, we delay one or more buses at a single stop, and determine how these delays grow over time. We compare the effects of two different types of holding on the stability of the system, and briefly investigate how our results change with the use of timepoints.",Human
"The performance of short distance optical interconnections in general relies very strongly on coupling structures, since they will determine the overall efficiency of the system to a large extent. Different configurations can be considered and a variety of manufacturing technologies can be used. We present two different discrete and two different integrated coupling components which can be used to deflect the light beam over 90 degrees and can play a crucial role when integrating optical interconnections in printed circuit boards. The fabrication process of the different coupling structures is discussed and experimental results are shown. The main characteristics of the coupling structures are given. The main advantages and disadvantages of the different components are discussed.",Human
"The photoionization spectrum of an atom in a magnetic field is calculated by combining R-matrix propagation with local adiabatic basis expansions. This approach considerably increases the speed and the energy range over which calculations can be performed compared to previous methods, allowing one to obtain accurate partial and total cross sections over an extended energy range for an arbitrary magnetic field strength. In addition, the cross sections for all atoms of interest can be calculated simultaneously in a single calculation. Multichannel quantum defect theory allows for a detailed analysis of the resonance structure in the continuum. Calculated cross sections for a range of atoms in both laboratory and astrophysical field strengths are presented.",Human
Maintenance of cooperation was studied for a two-strategy evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma game where the players are located on a one-dimensional chain and their payoff comes from games with the nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions. The applied host geometry makes possible to study the impacts of two conflicting topological features. The evolutionary rule involves some noise affecting the strategy adoptions between the interacting players. Using Monte Carlo simulations and the extended versions of dynamical mean-field theory we determined the phase diagram as a function of noise level and a payoff parameter. The peculiar feature of the diagram is changed significantly when the connectivity structure is extended by extra links as suggested by Newman and Watts.,Human
"We present an overview of Dr. Penrose's model of a cyclic universe, minus the big crunch which relies upon black hole collection of matter after an a long term expansion phase from an initial big bang . We affirm that the suggested evolution equation presented at his lecture for his model meets requirements as to an emergent quintessence field from a vacuum state . We try to offer suggestions as to how to investigate his controversial conformal mapping of matter/energy via Hawkings radiation from a potentially infinite number of black holes to a new big bang. This is his 'ripples in a pond' effect which we find highly unusual but worth serious study and investigation.",Human
"Powerful nanosecond light sources based on LEDs have been developed for use in astroparticle physics experiments. The light sources use either matrixes of ultra bright blue LEDs or a new generation high power blue LEDs. It's shown that such light sources have light yield of up to 10**10 - 10**12 photons per pulse with very fast light emission kinetics. The described light sources are important for use in calibration systems of Cherenkov and scintillator detectors. The developed light sources are currently used successfully in a number of astroparticle experiments, namely: the TUNKA EAS experiment, the Baikal neutrino experiment etc.",Human
"The various plasma models - incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, compressible MHD model, incompressible Hall MHD model, compressible Hall MHD model, electron MHD model, compressible Hall MHD with electron inertia model - notwithstanding the diversity of the underlying physics, are shown to exhibit some common features in the Beltrami states like certain robustness with respect to the plasma compressibility effects (albeit in the barotropy assumption) and the {\it Bernoulli} condition. The Beltrami states for these models are deduced by minimizing the appropriate total energy while keeping the appropriate total helicity constant. A Hamiltonian formulation framework is used to carry out these variational problems.",Human
"We investigate the kinematics of deformations in two and three dimensional media by explicitly solving (analytically) the evolution equations (Raychaudhuri equations) for the expansion, shear and rotation associated with the deformations. The analytical solutions allow us to study the dependence of the kinematical quantities on initial conditions. In particular, we are able to identify regions of the space of initial conditions that lead to a singularity in finite time. Some generic features of the deformations are also discussed in detail. We conclude by indicating the feasibility and utility of a similar exercise for fluid and geodesic flows in flat and curved spacetimes.",Human
"The maximum entropy principle can be used to assign utility values when only partial information is available about the decision maker's preferences. In order to obtain such utility values it is necessary to establish an analogy between probability and utility through the notion of a utility density function. According to some authors [Soofi (1990), Abbas (2006a) (2006b), Sandow et al. (2006), Friedman and Sandow (2006), Darooneh (2006)] the maximum entropy utility solution embeds a large family of utility functions. In this paper we explore the maximum entropy principle to estimate the utility function of a risk averse decision maker.",Human
"The investor is interested in the expected return and he is also concerned about the risk and the uncertainty assumed by the investment. One of the most popular concepts used to measure the risk and the uncertainty is the variance and/or the standard-deviation. In this paper we explore the following issues: Is the standard-deviation a good measure of risk and uncertainty? What are the potentialities of the entropy in this context? Can entropy present some advantages as a measure of uncertainty and simultaneously verify some basic assumptions of the portfolio management theory, namely the effect of diversification?",Human
"We introduce the innovative technologies, based on the concept of ""sensory substitution"", we are developing in the fields of biomedical engineering and human disability. Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate practical assistive biomedical and/or technical devices and/or rehabilitating procedures for persons with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback systems. Proposed applications are dealing with: (1) pressure sores prevention in case of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or tetraplegia); and (2) balance control improvement to prevent fall in older and/or disabled adults. This paper describes the architecture and the functioning principle of these biofeedback systems and presents preliminary results of two feasibility studies performed on young healthy adults.",Human
"In this paper we present a methodology to address the problem of brain tissue deformation referred to as 'brain-shift'. This deformation occurs throughout a neurosurgery intervention and strongly alters the accuracy of the neuronavigation systems used to date in clinical routine which rely solely on pre-operative patient imaging to locate the surgical target, such as a tumour or a functional area. After a general description of the framework of our intra-operative image-guided system, we describe a procedure to generate patient specific finite element meshes of the brain and propose a biomechanical model which can take into account tissue deformations and surgical procedures that modify the brain structure, like tumour or tissue resection.",Human

Statistical mechanics of a small system of cars on a single-lane road is developed. The system is not characterized by a Hamiltonian but by a conditional probability of a velocity of a car for the given velocity and distance of the car ahead. Distribution of car velocities for various densities of a group of cars are derived as well as probabilities of density fluctuations of the group for different velocities. For high braking abilities of cars free-flow and congested phases are found. Platoons of cars are formed for system of cars with inefficient brakes. A first order phase transition between free-flow and congested phase is suggested.,Human
"Many structures in nature are invariant under the transformation (p,r)->(br,-p/b), where b is some scale factor. Born's reciprocity hypothesis affirms that this invariance extends to the entire Hamiltonian and equations of motion. We investigate this idea for atomic physics and galactic motion, where one is basically dealing with a 1/r potential and the observations are very accurate, so as to determine the scale $b = m\Omega$. We find that an $\Omega \sim 1.5\times 10^{-15}$ Hz has essentially no effect on atomic physics but might possibly offer an explanation for galactic rotation, without invoking dark matter.",Human
"Total computational costs of scientific simulations are analyzed between direct numerical simulations (DNS) and multiphysics simulations (MPS) for sound generation in musical instruments. In order to produce acoustic sound by a turbulent flow in a simple recorder-like instrument, compressible fluid dynamic calculations with a low Mach number are required around the edges and the resonator of the instrument in DNS, while incompressible fluid dynamic calculations coupled with dynamics of sound propagation based on the Lighthill's acoustic analogy are used in MPS. These strategies are evaluated not only from the viewpoint of computational performances but also from the theoretical points of view as tools for scientific simulations of complicated systems.",Human
"In this work the physicochemical characterization of liposomes loaded with a newly synthesised carboranyl porphyrazine (H2HECASPz) is described. This molecule represents a potential drug for different anticancer therapies, such as Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Photodynamic Therapy and Photothermal Therapy. Different loading methods and different lipid mixtures were tested. The corresponding loaded vectors were studied by Small Angle Scattering (SANS and SAXS), light scattering and zeta potential. The combined analysis of structural data at various length scales and the measurement of the surface charge allowed to obtain a detailed characterization of the investigated systems. The mechanisms underlying the onset of differences in relevant physicochemical parameters (size, polydispersity and charge) were also critically discussed.",Human
"The propagation of compressional MHD waves is studied for an externally driven system. It is assumed that the combined action of the external sources and sinks of the entropy results in the harmonic oscillation of the entropy (and temperature) in the system. It is found that with the appropriate resonant conditions fast and slow waves get amplified due to the phenomenon of parametric resonance. Besides, it is shown that the considered waves are mutually coupled as a consequence of the nonequilibrium state of the background medium. The coupling is strongest when the plasma $\beta \approx 1$. The proposed formalism is sufficiently general and can be applied for many dynamical systems, both under terrestrial and astrophysical conditions.",Human
"A system of differential equations is proposed designed as to identify communities in weighted networks. The input is a symmetric connectivity matrix $A_{ij}$. A priori information on the number of communities is not needed. To verify the dynamics, we prepared sets of separate, fully connected clusters. In this case, the matrix $A$ has a block structure of zeros and units. A noise is introduced as positive random numbers added to zeros and subtracted from units. The task of the dynamics is to reproduce the initial block structure. In this test, the system outperforms the modularity algorithm, if the number of clusters is larger than four.",Human
"We propose new experiments with high sensitivity to a possible spatial or temporal variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio $\mu \equiv m_e/m_p$. We consider a nearly-degenerate pair of molecular vibrational levels, where each state is associated with a different electronic potential. The change in the splitting between such levels, with respect to a change in $\mu$, can be large both on an absolute scale and relative to the splitting. We demonstrate the existence of such pairs of levels in Cs$_2$. The narrow spectral lines achievable with ultracold Cs$_2$ in these long-lived levels make this system promising for future searches for small variations in $\mu$.",Human
"We use particle image velocimetry to measure the sedimentation dynamics of a semi-dilute suspension of non-Brownian spheres at Reynolds numbers, $0.001\le Re\le 2.3$, extending from the Stokes to the moderately inertial regime. We find that the onset of inertial corrections to Stokes sedimentation occurs when the inertial screening length $l=a/Re$ becomes similar to the Stokes sedimentation length $\xi_0$, at $Re_c= a/\xi_0\approx 0.05$. For $Re>Re_c$, inertial screening significantly reduces both the magnitude and spatial extent of the particle velocity fluctuations. A modified Hinch force balance model connects the fluctuation magnitudes $\sigma_V/V$ to the correlation sizes $\xi$.",Human
"The laser-driven acceleration of high quality proton beams from a double-layer target, comprised of a high-Z ion layer and a thin disk of hydrogen, is investigated with three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations in the case of oblique incidence of a laser pulse. It is shown that the proton beam energy reaches its maximum at a certain incidence angle of the laser pulse, where it can be much greater than the energy at normal incidence. The proton beam propagates at some angle with respect to the target surface normal, as determined by the proton energy and the incidence angle.",Human
"We propose a synthetical weights' dynamic mechanism for weighted networks which takes into account the influences of strengths of nodes, weights of links and incoming new vertices. Strength/Weight preferential strategies are used in these weights' dynamic mechanisms, which depict the evolving strategies of many real-world networks. We give insight analysis to the synthetical weights' dynamic mechanism and study how individual weights' dynamic strategies interact and cooperate with each other in the networks' evolving process. Power-law distributions of strength, degree and weight, nontrivial strength-degree correlation, clustering coefficients and assortativeness are found in the model with tunable parameters representing each model. Several homogenous functionalities of these independent weights' dynamic strategy are generalized and their synergy are studied.",Human
"The construction of the ATLAS electromagnetic liquid argon calorimeter modules is completed and all the modules are assembled and inserted in the cryostats. During the production period four barrel and three endcap modules were exposed to test beams in order to assess their performance, ascertain the production quality and reproducibility, and to scrutinize the complete energy reconstruction chain from the readout and calibration electronics to the signal and energy reconstruction. It was also possible to check the full Monte Carlo simulation of the calorimeter. The analysis of the uniformity, resolution and extraction of constant term is presented. Typical non-uniformities of 0.5% and typical global constant terms of 0.6% are measured for the barrel and end-cap modules.",Human
"The mass and kinetic energy distribution of nuclear fragments from thermal neutron induced fission of 235U have been studied using a Monte-Carlo simulation. Besides reproducing the pronounced broadening on the standard deviation of the final fragment kinetic energy distribution $\sigma_{e}(m)$ around the mass number m = 109, our simulation also produces a second broadening around m = 125, that is in agreement with the experimental data obtained by Belhafaf et al. These results are consequence of the characteristics of the neutron emission, the variation in the primary fragment mean kinetic energy and the yield as a function of the mass.",Human
"A theory of self-induced transparency of surface TM-mode propagating along a interface separating conventional and left-handed metamaterials is developed. A transition layer sandwiched between connected media is described using a model of a two-dimensional gas of quantum dots. Explicit analytical expressions for a surface optical soliton in the presence of single and biexciton transitions, depending on the magnetic permeability of the left-handed medium, are obtained with realistic parameters which can be reached in current experiments. It is shown that the sign of the total energy flow the surface mode depends on the material parameters of the quantum dots and the connected media.",Human
"Three-dimensional (3D) AC electro-osmotic (ACEO) pumps have recently been developed that are much faster and more robust than previous planar designs. The basic idea is to create a ``fluid conveyor belt'' by placing opposing ACEO slip velocities at different heights. Current designs involve electrodes with electroplated steps, whose heights have been optimized in simulations and experiments. Here, we consider changing the boundary conditions--rather than the geometry--and predict that flow rates can be further doubled by fabricating 3D features with non-polarizable materials. This amplifies the fluid conveyor belt by removing opposing flows on the vertical surfaces, and it increases the slip velocities which drive the flow.",Human
"One of the most important requirements for a detector at the ILC is good jet energy resolution. It is widely believed that the particle flow approach to calorimetry is the key to achieving the ILC goal of a di-jet invariant mass resolution sigma_m/m < Gamma_Z/m_Z. This paper describes the current performance of the PandoraPFA particle flow algorithm. For simulated light quark jets in the Tesla TDR detector, the jet energy resolution achieved is better than sigma_E/E ~ 3.4% for jet energies in the range 45-250 GeV. This represents the first demonstration that Particle Flow Calorimetry can reach the ILC jet energy resolution goals.",Human
"By viewing the electron as a wavepacket in the positive energy spectrum of the Dirac equation, we are able to achieve a much clearer understanding of its behavior under weak electromagnetic fields. The intrinsic spin magnetic moment is found to be established from the self-rotation of the wavepacket. A non-canonical structure is also exhibited in the equations of motion due to non- Abelian geometric phases of the Dirac spinors. The wavepacket energy can be expressed simply in terms of the kinetic, electrostatic, and Zeeman terms only. This can be transformed into an effective quantum Hamiltonian by a novel scheme, and reproduces the Pauli Hamiltonian with all-order relativistic corrections.",Human
"We address the interactions between optical solitons in the system with longitudinally varying nonlocality degree and nonlinearity strength. We consider a physical model describing light propagation in nematic liquid crystals featuring a strongly nonlocal nonlinear response. We reveal that the variation of the nonlocality and nonlinearity along the propagation direction can substantially enhance or weaken the interaction between out-of-phase solitons. This phenomenon manifests itself as a slowdown or acceleration of the soliton collision dynamics in one-dimensional geometries or of the soliton spiraling rate in bulk media. Therefore, one finds that by engineering the nonlocality and nonlinearity variation rate one can control the output soliton location.",Human
"A drawback of high-quality modes in optical microdisks is their isotropic light emission characteristics. Here we report a novel, robust, and general mechanism that results in highly directional light emission from those modes. This surprising finding is explained by a combination of wave phenomena (wave localization along unstable periodic ray trajectories) and chaotic ray dynamics in open systems (escape along unstable manifolds). The emission properties originating in the chaotic ray dynamics permit directional light output even from microlasers operating in the common multi-mode regime. We demonstrate our novel mechanism for the limacon billiard family and find directional emission with narrow angular divergence for a significant range of geometries and material parameters.",Human
"A crucial point in the debate on feasibility of earthquake prediction is the dependence of an earthquake magnitude from past seismicity. Indeed, whilst clustering in time and space is widely accepted, much more questionable is the existence of magnitude correlations. The standard approach generally assumes that magnitudes are independent and therefore in principle unpredictable. Here we show the existence of clustering in magnitude: earthquakes occur with higher probability close in time, space and magnitude to previous events. More precisely, the next earthquake tends to have a magnitude similar but smaller than the previous one. A dynamical scaling relation between magnitude, time and space distances reproduces the complex pattern of magnitude, spatial and temporal correlations observed in experimental seismic catalogs.",Human
We present data that show a cycling transition can be used to detect and image metastable He$_2$ triplet molecules in superfluid helium. We demonstrate that limitations on the cycling efficiency due to the vibrational structure of the molecule can be mitigated by the use of repumping lasers. Images of the molecules obtained using the method are also shown. This technique gives rise to a new kind of ionizing radiation detector. The use of He$_2$ triplet molecules as tracer particles in the superfluid promises to be a powerful tool for visualization of both quantum and classical turbulence in liquid helium.,Human
"The theory of internal waves between two layers of immiscible fluids is important both for its applications in oceanography and engineering, and as a source of interesting mathematical model equations that exhibit nonlinearity and dispersion. A Boussinesq system for two-way propagation of interfacial waves in a rigid lid configuration is derived. In most cases, the nonlinearity is quadratic. However, when the square of the depth ratio is close to the density ratio, the coefficients of the quadratic nonlinearities become small and cubic nonlinearities must be considered. The propagation as well as the collision of solitary waves and/or fronts is studied numerically.",Human
"Linear Collider Alignment and Survey (LiCAS) R&D group is proposing a novel automated metrology instrument dedicated to align and monitor the mechanical stability of a future linear high energy e+e- collider. LiCAS uses Laser Straightness Monitors (LSM) and Frequency Scanning Interferometry (FSI) for straightness and absolute distance measurements, respectively. This paper presents detailed simulations of a LiCAS system operating inside a Rapid Tunnel Reference Surveyor (RTRS train). With the proposed design it is feasible to achieve the required vertical accuracy of the order of 200 micons over 600 m tunnel sections meeting the specification for the TESLA collider.",Human
"In this work, we aim to gain a better understanding of the volatility smile observed in options markets through microsimulation (MS). We adopt two types of active traders in our MS model: speculators and arbitrageurs, and call and put options on one underlying asset. Speculators make decisions based on their expectations of the asset price at the option expiration time. Arbitrageurs trade at different arbitrage opportunities such as violation of put-call parity. Difference in liquidity among options is also included. Notwithstanding its simplicity, our model can generate implied volatility (IV) curves similar to empirical observations. Our results suggest that the volatility smile is related to the competing effect of heterogeneous trading behavior and the impact of differential liquidity.",Human
"The discovery of community structure is a common challenge in the analysis of network data. Many methods have been proposed for finding community structure, but few have been proposed for determining whether the structure found is statistically significant or whether, conversely, it could have arisen purely as a result of chance. In this paper we show that the significance of community structure can be effectively quantified by measuring its robustness to small perturbations in network structure. We propose a suitable method for perturbing networks and a measure of the resulting change in community structure and use them to assess the significance of community structure in a variety of networks, both real and computer generated.",Human
"After approximate replacing of Maxwellian distribution exponent with the rational polynomial fraction we have obtained precise analytical expression for and calculated the principal value of logarithmically divergent integral in the electron wave dispersion equation. At the same time our calculations have shown the presence of strong collisionless damping of the electromagnetic low-velocity (electron) wave in plasmas with Maxwellian-like electron velocity distribution function at some small, of the order of several per cents, differences from Maxwellian distribution in the main region of large electron densities, however due to the differences in the distribution tail, where electron density itself is negligibly small.",Human
"The authors report on observation of Bragg confined mode in a hollow cylindrical dielectric cavity. A resonance was observed at 13.4 $GHz$ with an unloaded Q-factor of order $2\times10^5$, which is more than a factor of 6 above the dielectric loss limit. Previously such modes have only been realized from pure Transverse Electric modes with no azimuthal variations and only the $E_{\phi}$ component. From rigorous numeric simulations it is shown that the mode is a hybrid mode with non-zero azimuthal variations and with dominant $E_r$ and $E_{\phi}$ electric field components and $H_z$ magnetic field component.",Human
"We analyze the contact and force networks in a dense confined packing of pentagonal particles simulated by means of the contact dynamics method. The particle shape effect is evidenced by comparing the data from pentagon packing and from a packing with identical characteristics except for the circular shape of the particles. A surprising observation is that the pentagon packing develops a lower structural anisotropy than the disk packing. We show in this work that this weakness is compensated by a higher force anisotropy that leads to enhanced shear strength of the pentagon packing. With the polygonal shape of the particles, the strong force chains are mostly composed of edge-to-edge contacts with a marked zig-zag aspect.",Human
"We report the first observation of the Goos-H$\rm \ddot{\textbf{a}}$nchen shift of a light beam incident on a metal surface. This phenomenon is particularly interesting because the Goos-H$\rm \ddot{\textbf{a}}$nchen shift for $p$ polarized light in metals is negative and much bigger than the positive shift for $s$ polarized light. The experimental result for the measured shifts as a function of the angle of incidence is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. In an energy-flux interpretation, our measurement shows the existence of a backward energy flow at the bare metal surface when this is excited by a $p$ polarized beam of light.",Human
"The paper studies the validity of Maxwell equation in the case for coexistence of electromagnetic field and gravitational field. With the algebra of quaternions, the Newton's law of gravitation is the same as that in classical theory of gravitational field. Meanwhile the Maxwell equation is identical with that in classical theory of electromagnetic field. And the related conclusions can be spread to the case for coexistence of electromagnetic field and gravitational field by the algebra of octonions. The study claims that Maxwell equation keeps unchanged in the case for coexistence of gravitational field and electromagnetic field, except for the direction of displacement current.",Human
"We consider the effects of temporal delay in a neural feedback system with excitation and inhibition. The topology of our model system reflects the anatomy of the avian isthmic circuitry, a feedback structure found in all classes of vertebrates. We show that the system is capable of performing a `winner-take-all' selection rule for certain combinations of excitatory and inhibitory feedback. In particular, we show that when the time delays are sufficiently large a system with local inhibition and global excitation can function as a `winner-take-all' network and exhibit oscillatory dynamics. We demonstrate how the origin of the oscillations can be attributed to the finite delays through a linear stability analysis.",Human
"Constant-pressure molecular-dynamics simulations of phospholipid membranes in the fluid phase reveal strong correlations between equilibrium fluctuations of volume and energy on the nanosecond time-scale. The existence of strong volume-energy correlations was previously deduced indirectly by Heimburg from experiments focusing on the phase transition between the fluid and the ordered gel phases. The correlations, which are reported here for three different membranes (DMPC, DMPS-Na, and DMPSH), have volume-energy correlation coefficients ranging from 0.81 to 0.89. The DMPC membrane was studied at two temperatures showing that the correlation coefficient increases as the phase transition is approached.",Human
"The theory of four-body systems is revisited. It is illustrated that the theory provides a rigorous proof for the formation of ground state (unexcited) biexcitons in molecular crystals. The generalization of the theory predicts the possible existence of excited biexcitons in nature. In order to test the validity of the extended theory on computational level, a very elaborate computer code is constructed for the treatment of arbitrary four-body system with arbitrary electron/hole mass ratio and arbitrary exciton - exciton interaction (VXX). The results, for mass ratio = 1 and VXX is a pure Coulomb force, show that the test is successful. Realization of these conclusions on experimental level should open the door for wide industrial applications.",Human
"This study demonstrates how the incremental 4D-Var data assimilation method can be applied efficiently preconditione d in an application to an oceanographic problem. The approach consists in performing a few iterations of the reduced-order 4D-Var prior to the incremental 4D-Var in the full space in order to achieve faster convergence. An application performed in the tropical Pacific Ocean, with assimilation of TAO temperature data, shows the method to be both feasible and efficient. It allows the global cost of the assimilation to be reduced by a factor of 2 without affecting the quality of the solution.",Human
"A complete scheme for production, cooling, acceleration, and ring for a 1.5 TeV center of mass muon collider is presented, together with parameters for two higher energy machines. The schemes starts with the front end of a proposed neutrino factory that yields bunch trains of both muon signs. Six dimensional cooling in long-period helical lattices reduces the longitudinal emittance until it becomes possible to merge the trains into single bunches, one of each sign. Further cooling in all dimensions is applied to the single bunches in further helical lattices. Final transverse cooling to the required parameters is achieved in 50 T solenoids.",Human
"Acrylic acid (AA) is a monomer commonly employed in emulsion polymerization to provide electrostatic colloidal stability and improve specific film performance. The addition of AA not only modifies the kinetics of the polymerization, but also it takes part in the interaction between colloidal particles, which has a strong influence on their packing and consequent latex film properties. In this contribution a theoretical modeling of the latex film formation is presented and compared to experimental results: water vapor permeability and latex film capacitance are studied as a function of AA content. It has been shown that water uptake is mainly affected by film morphology which in turn is defined by intercolloidal interaction and drying rate.",Human
"We report a theoretical study of Feshbach resonances in $^{6}$Li + $^{23}$Na and $^{7}$Li + $^{23}$Na mixtures at ultracold temperatures using new accurate interaction potentials in a full quantum coupled-channel calculation. Feshbach resonances for $l=0$ in the initial collisional open channel $^6$Li$(f=1/2, m_f=1/2) + ^{23}$Na$(f=1, m_f=1)$ are found to agree with previous measurements, leading to precise values of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths for the $^{6,7}$Li$+^{23}$Na pairs. We also predict additional Feshbach resonances within experimentally attainable magnetic fields for other collision channels.",Human
"Coherent backscattering is due to constructive interferences of reciprocal paths and leads to an enhancement of the intensity of a multiply scattered field near its source. To observe this enhancement an array of receivers is conventionally placed close to the source. Our approach here is different. In a first experiment, we recover the coherent backscattering effect (CBE) within an array of sources and a distant receiver using time correlation of diffuse fields. The enhancement cone has an excellent spatial resolution. The dynamics of the enhancement factor is studied in a second experiment using correlation of thermal phonons at the same ultrasonic frequencies, without any active source.",Human
"This paper presents the current achievements of a long term project aiming at predicting and assessing the impact of tongue and mouth floor surgery on tongue mobility. The ultimate objective of this project is the design of a software with which surgeons should be able (1) to design a 3D biomechanical model of the tongue and of the mouth floor that matches the anatomical characteristics of each patient specific oral cavity, (2) to simulate the anatomical changes induced by the surgery and the possible reconstruction, and (3) to quantitatively predict and assess the consequences of these anatomical changes on tongue mobility and speech production after surgery.",Human
"This paper suggests a full protocol of Computer Aided Surgery as previously recommended in literature addressing the challenging task of primary or secondary reconstruction of orbito-zygomatic dislocation. First, on a specifically developed planning software, the best zygoma reduction and orbital boundaries reconstruction to achieve skeletal symmetry are determined. This treatment plan is then transferred to the 3D Navigation Systems within the operating room. After patient's anatomy registration to his preoperative CT scan data, the navigation system allows zygomatic guiding to its planned reduced location and bone orbital volume restoration control. The feasibility of this technique was checked in 3 patients with major orbito-zygomatic deformities. Preliminary clinical results are presented.",Human
"It is widely recognized that good jet energy resolution is one of the most important requirements to the detectors for the future linear $e^+e^-$ collider experiments. The Particle Flow Analysis (PFA) is currently under intense studies as the most promising way to achieving the best attainable resolution. In order to clarify the fundamental limits on the jet energy resolution with the PFA, we have developed a set of C++ classes that facilitates history keeping of particle tracks within the framework of Geant4. In this paper this software tool is described and applied to a generic detector model so as to identify fundamental limiting factors to the PFA performance.",Human
"We examine the results of two measurements by the CLAS collaboration, one of which claimed evidence for a $\Theta^{+}$ pentaquark, whilst the other found no such evidence. The unique feature of these two experiments was that they were performed with the same experimental setup. Using a Bayesian analysis we find that the results of the two experiments are in fact compatible with each other, but that the first measurement did not contain sufficient information to determine unambiguously the existence of a $\Theta^{+}$. Further, we suggest a means by which the existence of a new candidate particle can be tested in a rigorous manner.",Human
"Self-compression of multi-millijoule femtosecond laser pulses and dramatic increase of the peak intensity are found in pressurized helium and neon within a range of intensity in which the ionization modification of the material parameters by the pulse is negligible. The pulse propagation is studied by the (3+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger equation including basic lowest order optical processes -- diffraction, group velocity dispersion of second order, and Kerr nonlinearity of third order. Smooth and well controllable pulse propagation dynamics is found. Constructing of compressed pulse of controllable parameters at given space target point can be achieved by a proper chose of the pulse energy and/or gas pressure.",Human
"We discuss a number of fundamental aspects of modern cosmological concepts, from the phenomenological, observational, theoretical and epistemic points of view. We argue that the modern cosmology, despite a great advent, in particular in the observational sector, is yet to solve important problems, posed already by the classical times. In particular the stress is put on discerning the scientific features of modern cosmological paradigms from the more speculative ones, with the latter immersed in some aspects deeply into mythological world picture. We finally discuss the principal paradigms, which are present in the modern cosmological studies and evaluate their epistemic merits.   KEY WORDS: cosmology, epistemology, methodology, mythology, philosophy of science",Human
"The behavior of complex networks under attack depends strongly on the specific attack scenario. Of special interest are scale-free networks, which are usually seen as robust under random failure or attack but appear to be especially vulnerable to targeted attacks. In a recent study of public transport networks of 14 major cities of the world we have shown that these networks may exhibit scale-free behaviour [Physica A 380, 585 (2007)]. Our further analysis, subject of this report, focuses on the effects that defunct or removed nodes have on the properties of public transport networks. Simulating different attack strategies we elaborate vulnerability criteria that allow to find minimal strategies with high impact on these systems.",Human
"We present a treatment of the nonlinear matter wave propagation inspired from optical methods, which includes interaction effects within the atom optics equivalent of the aberrationless approximation. The atom-optical ABCD matrix formalism, considered so far for non-interacting clouds, is extended perturbatively beyond the linear regime of propagation. This approach, applied to discuss the stability of a matter-wave resonator involving a free-falling sample, agrees very well with the predictions of the full nonlinear paraxial wave equation. An alternative optical treatment of interaction effects, based on the aberrationless approximation and suitable for cylindrical paraxial beams of uniform linear density, is also adapted for matter waves.",Human
"We present methods to improve the energy resolution of single-channel, room-temperature Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) detectors. A new preamplifier design enables the acquisition of the actual transient current from the crystals and straightforward data analysis methods yield unprecedented energy resolution for our test-detectors. These consist of an eV-CAPture Plus crystal as standard and 1 cm cube Frisch collar crystals created in-house from low-grade coplanar grid detectors. Energy resolutions of 1.9% for our collar detectors and 0.8% for the eV crystal at 662 keV were obtained. The latter compares favourably to the best existing energy resolution results from pixel detectors.",Human
"We present an efficient, principled, and interpretable technique for inferring module assignments and for identifying the optimal number of modules in a given network. We show how several existing methods for finding modules can be described as variant, special, or limiting cases of our work, and how the method overcomes the resolution limit problem, accurately recovering the true number of modules. Our approach is based on Bayesian methods for model selection which have been used with success for almost a century, implemented using a variational technique developed only in the past decade. We apply the technique to synthetic and real networks and outline how the method naturally allows selection among competing models.",Human
"The emission of Auger electrons from the K-, L- and M-sheels of two configurations of copper atoms is investigated in detail within the frame work of the momentum average technique. Ab initio calculations for the bound state wavefunctions of the ionized atoms are performed using a Gaussian computer code. The continuum wavefunctions of the emitted electrons are determined by employing an effective potential variational approach. Slight differences have been noticed between the results of both configurations. The transition rates, energies and widths of all possible Auger electrons are listed in Tables. Slight differences have been noticed between the results of the two types of copper atoms.",Human
"We obtain analytic solution of the time-independent Schrodinger equation in two dimensions for a charged particle moving in the field of an electric quadrupole. The solution is written as a series in terms of special functions that support a tridiagonal matrix representation for the angular and radial components of the wave operator. This solution is for all energies, the discrete (for bound states) as well as the continuous (for scattering states). The expansion coefficients of the wavefunction are written in terms of orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recursion relations. The charged particle could become bound to the quadrupole only if its moment exceeds a certain critical value.",Human
"It is shown that a new type of metamaterial, a 3D-array of toroidal solenoids, displays a significant toroidal response that can be readily measured. This is in sharp contrast to materials that exist in nature, where the toroidal component is weak and hardly measurable. The existence of an optimal configuration, maximizing the interaction with an external electromagnetic field, is demonstrated. In addition, it is found that a characteristic feature of the magnetic toroidal response is its strong dependence on the background dielectric permittivity of the host material, which suggests possible applications. Negative refraction and backward waves exist in a composite toroidal metamaterial, consisting of an array of wires and an array of toroidal solenoids.",Human
"In a previous paper [S. Ghosal, Phys. Rev. E 74, 041901 (2006)] a hydrodynamic model for determining the electrophoretic speed of a polyelectrolyte through an axially symmetric slowly varying nanopore was presented in the limit of a vanishingly small Debye length. Here the case of a finite Debye layer thickness is considered while restricting the pore geometry to that of a cylinder of length much larger than the diameter. Further, the possibility of a uniform surface charge on the walls of the nanopore is taken into account. It is thereby shown that the calculated transit times are consistent with recent measurements in silicon nanopores.",Human
"The mechanism underlying the substantial amplification of the high-order harmonics q \pm 2K (K integer) upon the addition of a weak seed XUV field of harmonic frequency q\omega to a strong IR field of frequency \omega is analyzed in the framework of the quantum-mechanical Floquet formalism and the semiclassical re-collision model. According to the Floquet analysis, the high-frequency field induces transitions between several Floquet states and leads to the appearance of new dipole cross terms. The semiclassical re-collision model suggests that the origin of the enhancement lies in the time-dependent modulation of the ground electronic state induced by the XUV field.",Human
"Cells continuously probe their environment with membrane receptors, achieving subsecond adaptation of their behaviour [1-3]. Recently, several receptors, including cadherins, were found to bind ligands with a lifetime of order of one second. Here we show at the single molecule level that homotypic C-cadherin association involves transient intermediates lasting less than a few tens of milliseconds. Further, these intermediates transitionned towards more stable states with a kinetic rate displaying exponential decrease with piconewton forces. These features enable cells to detect ligands or measure surrounding mechanical behaviour within a fraction of a second, much more rapidly than was previously thought.",Human
"We describe the design and realization of a scheme for uv laser spectroscopy of singly-ionized iron (Fe II) with very high resolution. A buffer-gas cooled laser ablation source is used to provide a plasma close to room temperature with a high density of Fe II. We combine this with a scheme for pulsed-laser saturation spectroscopy to yield sub-Doppler resolution. In a demonstration experiment, we have examined an Fe II transition near 260 nm, attaining a linewidth of about 250 MHz. The method is well-suited to measuring transition frequencies and hyperfine structure. It could also be used to measure small isotope shifts in isotope-enriched samples.",Human
"We propose an exactly solvable model for the dynamics of voters in a two-party system. The opinion formation process is modeled on a random network of agents. The dynamical nature of interpersonal relations is also reflected in the model, as the connections in the network evolve with the dynamics of the voters. In the infinite time limit, an exact solution predicts the emergence of consensus, for arbitrary initial conditions. However, before consensus is reached, two different metastable states can persist for exponentially long times. One state reflects a perfect balancing of opinions, the other reflects a completely static situation. An estimate of the associated lifetimes suggests that lack of consensus is typical for large systems.",Human
"Lower bound for ${\bar \rho}''(0)$, the second derivative of the spherically averaged atomic electronic density at the nucleus, and upper bound for ${\bar \rho}'''(0)$, the third derivative, are obtained respectively. It is shown that, for the ground state, ${\bar \rho}''(0) \ge {10/3} Z^2 \rho(0)$ and ${\bar \rho}'''(0) \le -{14/3}Z^3 \rho(0)$ where $Z$ is the charge of the nucleus, and $\rho(0)$ is the electron density at the nucleus. Tighter bounds for ${\bar \rho}''(0)$ and ${\bar \rho}'''(0)$ are also reported which are valid for both the ground state and excited states. Explicit illustration with the example of one-electron atomic ions is given.",Human
The airborne traffic monitoring system forms a novel technology of detecting vehicle motion. An optical digital camera located on an airborne platform produces a series of images which then are processed to recognized the fixed vehicles. In this way the video data are converted into the time sequence of frames containing the vehicle coordinates. In the present work a three-frame algorithm is developed to identify the succeeding vehicle positions. It is based on finding the neighboring points in the frame sequence characterized by minimal acceleration. To verify and optimize the developed algorithm a ``Virtual Road'' simulator was created. Finally available empirical data are analyzed using the created algorithm.,Human
"The present study deals with the analysis and mapping of Swiss franc interest rates. Interest rates depend on time and maturity, defining term structure of the interest rate curves (IRC). In the present study IRC are considered in a two-dimensional feature space - time and maturity. Geostatistical models and machine learning algorithms (multilayer perceptron and Support Vector Machines) were applied to produce interest rate maps. IR maps can be used for the visualisation and patterns perception purposes, to develop and to explore economical hypotheses, to produce dynamic asses-liability simulations and for the financial risk assessments. The feasibility of an application of interest rates mapping approach for the IRC forecasting is considered as well.",Human
"The present study deals with the analysis and classification of interest rate curves. Interest rate curves (IRC) are the basic financial curves in many different fields of economics and finance. They are extremely important tools in banking and financial risk management problems. Interest rates depend on time and maturity which defines term structure of the interest rate curves. IRC are composed of interest rates at different maturities (usually fixed number) which move coherently in time. In the present study machine learning algorithms, namely Self-Organising maps - SOM (Kohonen maps), are used to find clusters and to classify Swiss franc (CHF) interest rate curves.",Human
"A Lead Tungstate crystal produced for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS experiment at the LHC was cut into three equal-length sections. The central one was irradiated with 290 MeV/c positive pions up to a fluence of (5.67 +- 0.46)x10^13 /cm^2, while the other two were exposed to a 24 GeV/c proton fluence of (1.17 +- 0.11) x 10^13/ cm^2. The damage recovery in these crystals, stored in the dark at room temperature, has been followed over two years. The comparison of the radiation-induced changes in light transmission for these crystals shows that damage is proportional to the star densities produced by the irradiation.",Human
"To facilitate the testing of models for the evolution of languages, the present note offers a set of linguistic features that are approximately independent of each other. To find these features, the adjusted Rand index R' is used to estimate the degree of pairwise relationship among 130 linguistic features in a large published database. Many of the R' values prove to be near 0, as predicted for independent features, and a subset of 47 features is found with an average R' of -0.0001. These 47 features are recommended for use in statistical tests that require independent units of analysis.",Human
"We demonstrate the effectiveness of a guided-wave Bose-Einstein condensate interferometer for practical measurements. Taking advantage of the large arm separations obtainable in our interferometer, the energy levels of the 87Rb atoms in one arm of the interferometer are shifted by a calibrated laser beam. The resulting phase shifts are used to determine the ac polarizability at a range of frequencies near and at the atomic resonance. The measured values are in good agreement with theoretical expectations. However, we observe a broadening of the transition near the resonance, an indication of collective light scattering effects. This nonlinearity may prove useful for the production and control of squeezed quantum states.",Human
"We analyze the existence, stability, and mobility of gap solitons in a periodic photonic structure with nonlocal nonlinearity. Within the Bragg region of band gaps, gap solitons exhibit better stability and higher mobility due to the combinations of non-locality effect and the oscillation nature of Bloch waves. Using linear stability analysis and calculating the Peierls-Nabarro potentials, we demonstrate that gap solitons can revive a non-trivial elastic-like collision even in the periodic systems with the help of nonlocal nonlinearity. Such interesting behaviors of gap solitons in nonlocal nonlinear photonic crystals are believed to be useful in optical switching devices.",Human
"In the present work, a geometrical method to generate a two dimensional random walk by means of a bidimensional Cellular Automaton is presented. We illustrate it by means of Conway's Game of Life with periodical borders, with a large lattice of 3000 x 3000 cells. The obtained random walk is of character anomalous, and its projection to a one dimensional random walk is analyzed, showing that it presents some statistical properties similar to the so-called stylized facts observed in financial time series. We consider that the procedure presented here is important not only because of its simplicity, but also because it could help us to understand and shed light on the stylized facts formation mechanism.",Human
"Neurosurgery interventions involve complex tracking systems because a tissue deformation takesplace. The neuronavigation system relies only on preoperative images. In order to overcome the soft tissue deformations and guarantee the accuracy of the navigation a biomechanical model can be used during surgery to simulate the deformation of the brain. Therefore, a mesh generation for an optimal real-time Finite Element Model (FEM) becomes crucial. In this work we present different alternatives from a meshgeneration point of view that were evaluated to optimize the process in terms of elements quantity and quality as well as constraints of a intraoperative application and patient specific data.",Human
"Because of its inherent 2-D character, the eigenvalue equation for the hindered rotation around a normal cation site of an off-center impurity nearest-neighboring an F center is the well-known Mathieu equation. We present an overview of literature data on Mathieu's periodic functions providing exact solutions to the Li+ reorientational problem. We compare them with bottom-well approximating solutions by harmonic-oscillator functions at an effective vibrational frequency renormalized by both first- and third- order electron-mode coupling. We finally discuss the in-plane inversion polarizability of an off-center impurity assumed to form a dipole-dipole coupling with a nearby F center.",Human
"The scattering length is commonly used to characterize the strength of ultracold atomic interactions, since it is the leading parameter in the low-energy expansion of the scattering phase shift. Its value can be modified via a magnetic field, by using a Feshbach resonance. However, the effective range term, which is the second parameter in the phase shift expansion, determines the width of the resonance and gives rise to important properties of ultracold gases. Independent control over this parameter is not possible by using a magnetic field only. We demonstrate that a combination of magnetic and electric fields can be used to get independent control over both parameters, which leads to full control over elastic ultracold interactions.",Human
"We describe the fractal solid by a special continuous medium model. We propose to describe the fractal solid by a fractional continuous model, where all characteristics and fields are defined everywhere in the volume but they follow some generalized equations which are derived by using integrals of fractional order. The order of fractional integral can be equal to the fractal mass dimension of the solid. Fractional integrals are considered as an approximation of integrals on fractals. We suggest the approach to compute the moments of inertia for fractal solids. The dynamics of fractal solids are described by the usual Euler's equations. The possible experimental test of the continuous medium model for fractal solids is considered.",Human
"We study a new ensemble of random correlation matrices related to multivariate Student (or more generally elliptic) random variables. We establish the exact density of states of empirical correlation matrices that generalizes the Marcenko-Pastur result. The comparison between the theoretical density of states in the Student case and empirical financial data is surprisingly good, even if we are still able to detect systematic deviations. Finally, we compute explicitely the Kullback-Leibler entropies of empirical Student matrices, which are found to be independent of the true correlation matrix, as in the Gaussian case. We provide numerically exact values for these Kullback-Leibler entropies.",Human
"We investigate distribution of magnetic fields around dense solid plasmas generated by intense p-polarized laser (~10^{16} W.cm^{-2}, 100 fs) irradiation of magnetic tapes, using high sensitivity magneto optical microscopy. We present evidence for giant axial magnetic fields and map out for the first time the spatial distribution of these fields. By using the axial magnetic field distribution as a diagnostic tool we uncover evidence for angular momentum associated with the plasma. We believe this study holds significance for investigating the process under which a magnetic material magnetizes or demagnetizes under the influence of ultrashort intense laser pulses.",Human
"Topology of urban environments can be represented by means of graphs. We explore the graph representations of several compact urban patterns by random walks. The expected time of recurrence and the expected first passage time to a node scales apparently linearly in all urban patterns we have studied In space syntax theory, a positive relation between the local property of a node (qualified by connectivity or by the recurrence time) and the global property of the node (estimated in our approach by the first passage time to it) is known as intelligibility. Our approach based on random walks allows to extend the notion of intelligibility onto the entire domain of complex networks and graph theory.",Human
"We investigate the traffic flows of the Korean highway system, which contains both public and private transportation information. We find that the traffic flow T(ij) between city i and j forms a gravity model, the metaphor of physical gravity as described in Newton's law of gravity, P(i)P(j)/r(ij)^2, where P(i) represents the population of city i and r(ij) the distance between cities i and j. It is also shown that the highway network has a heavy tail even though the road network is a rather uniform and homogeneous one. Compared to the highway network, air and public ground transportation establish inhomogeneous systems and have power-law behaviors.",Human

Megahed, S.R. Komy, A.A. Afify [Acta Mechanica 151, 185-194 (2001)]   In the above paper is investigated the boundary layer flow of an electrically conducting fluid over a vertical, stationary plate placed in a calm fluid. The effects of Hall and ion-slip currents are taken into account. The boundary layer equations are transformed into ordinary ones using a scaling group of transformations and subsequently are solved numerically. However, there are two fundamental errors in the above paper which are presented below.",Human
"It is argued that the present log-normal distribution of language sizes is, to a large extent, a consequence of demographic dynamics within the population of speakers of each language. A two-parameter stochastic multiplicative process is proposed as a model for the population dynamics of individual languages, and applied over a period spanning the last ten centuries. The model disregards language birth and death. A straightforward fitting of the two parameters, which statistically characterize the population growth rate, predicts a distribution of language sizes in excellent agreement with empirical data. Numerical simulations, and the study of the size distribution within language families, validate the assumptions at the basis of the model.",Human
"This work presents accurate {\it ab initio} determination of the magnetic dipole (M1) and electric quadrupole (E2) hyperfine structure constants for the ground and a few low-lying excited states in $^{67}$Zn$^{+}$, which is one of the interesting systems in fundamental physics. The coupled-cluster (CC) theory within the relativistic framework has been used here in this calculations. Long standing demands for a relativistic and highly correlated calculations like CC can be able to resolve the disagreements among the lifetime estimations reported previously for a few low-lying states of Zn$^{+}$. The role of different electron correlation effects in the determination of these quantities are discussed and their contributions are presented.",Human
"A chain of singly-charged particles, confined by a harmonic potential, exhibits a sudden transition to a zigzag configuration when the radial potential reaches a critical value, depending on the particle number. This structural change is a phase transition of second order, whose order parameter is the crystal displacement from the chain axis. We study analytically the transition using Landau theory and find full agreement with numerical predictions by [J. Schiffer Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 818 (1993)] and [Piacente et al Phys. Rev. B 69, 045324 (2004)]. Our theory allows us to determine analytically the system's behaviour at the transition point.",Human
"The problem of estimation error in portfolio optimization is discussed, in the limit where the portfolio size N and the sample size T go to infinity such that their ratio is fixed. The estimation error strongly depends on the ratio N/T and diverges for a critical value of this parameter. This divergence is the manifestation of an algorithmic phase transition, it is accompanied by a number of critical phenomena, and displays universality. As the structure of a large number of multidimensional regression and modelling problems is very similar to portfolio optimization, the scope of the above observations extends far beyond finance, and covers a large number of problems in operations research, machine learning, bioinformatics, medical science, economics, and technology.",Human
"It is shown that the geometry of multi-electron threshold ionization in atoms depends on the initial configuration of bound electrons. The reason for this behavior is found in the stability properties of the classical fixed point of the equations of motion for multiple threshold fragmentation. Specifically for three-electron break-up, apart from the symmetric triangular configuration also a break-up of lower symmetry in the form of a T-shape can occur, as we demonstrate by calculating triple photoionization for the lithium ground and first excited states. We predict the electron break-up geometry for threshold fragmentation experiments.",Human
"Employing data on the assessed value of land in 1974--2007 Japan, we exhibit a quasistatically varying log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. In the derivation, a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed quasi-balance is adopted together with two approximations. The resultant distribution is power-law with the varying exponent in the large scale region and the quasistatic log-normal distribution with the varying standard deviation in the middle scale region. In the distribution, not only the change of the exponent but also the change of the standard deviation depends on the parameter of the detailed quasi-balance. These results are consistently confirmed by the empirical data.",Human
"Coincidence experiments on EPR pairs show strong violations of Bell's Inequalities at certain filter settings which is widely believed to mean that local hidden variable models cannot explain these results. In this paper it is shown that the 'non-separable' singlet density matrix can be represented as a sum of separable density matrices which are products of individual non-hermitian spin operator states. This decomposition is consistent with the intuitive notion that after separation from the singlet the two physical systems should be described by a product state. In spite of the non-hermiticity, the values of the relevant spin observables are real. A new local hidden variable model inspired by this decomposition is discussed.",Human
"In this paper, I outline some problems in the students' understanding of the explanation of recoil motion when introduced to them in the context of Newton's third law. I propose to explain the origin of recoil from a microscopic point of view, which emphasizes the exact mechanism leading to recoil. This mechanism differs from one system to another. Several examples that can be easily implemented in the classroom environment are given in this paper. Such a profound understanding of the origin of recoil help students avoid some of the misconceptions that might arise from the phenomenological approach, and stimulates their thinking in the fundamental origins of other physical phenomena.",Human
"The interaction between planetary waves and an arbitrary zonal flow is studied from a phase-space viewpoint. Using the Wigner distribution, a planetary wave Vlasov equation is derived that includes the contribution of the mean flow to the zonal potential vorticity gradient. This equation is applied to the problem of planetary wave modulational instability, where it is used to predict a fastest growing mode of finite wavenumber. A wave-mean flow numerical model is used to test the analytical predictions, and an intuitive explanation of modulational instability and jet asymmetry is given via the motion of planetary wavepackets in phase space.",Human
"A unified description of the free-space cylindrical vector beams is presented, which is an integral transformation solution to the vector Helmholtz equation and the transversality condition. The amplitude 2-form of the angular spectrum involved in this solution can be arbitrarily chosen. When one of the two elements is zero, we arrive at either transverse-electric or transverse-magnetic beam mode. In the paraxial condition, this solution not only includes the known $J_1$ Bessel-Gaussian vector beam and the axisymmetric Laguerre-Gaussian vector beam that were obtained by solving the paraxial wave equations, but also predicts two new kinds of vector beam, called the modified-Bessel-Gaussian vector beam.",Human
"An analytical description of the response properties of simple but realistic neuron models in the presence of noise is still lacking. We determine completely up to the second order the firing statistics of a single and a pair of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (LIFs) receiving some common slowly filtered white noise. In particular, the auto- and cross-correlation functions of the output spike trains of pairs of cells are obtained from an improvement of the adiabatic approximation introduced in \cite{Mor+04}. These two functions define the firing variability and firing synchronization between neurons, and are of much importance for understanding neuron communication.",Human
"Recombination of H3+ with electrons was studied in a low temperature plasma in helium. The plasma recombination rate is driven by two body, H3+ + e, and three-body, H3+ + e + He, processes with the rate coefficients 7.5x10^{-8}cm3/s and 2.8x10^{-25}cm6/s correspondingly at 260K. The two-body rate coefficient is in excellent agreement with results from storage ring experiments and theoretical calculations. We suggest that the three-body recombination involves formation of highly excited Rydberg neutral H3 followed by an l- or m- changing collision with He. Plasma electron spectroscopy indicates the presence of H3.",Human
"Spike correlations between neurons are ubiquitous in the cortex, but their role is at present not understood. Here we describe the firing response of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (LIF) when it receives a temporarily correlated input generated by presynaptic correlated neuronal populations. Input correlations are characterized in terms of the firing rates, Fano factors, correlation coefficients and correlation timescale of the neurons driving the target neuron. We show that the sum of the presynaptic spike trains cannot be well described by a Poisson process. Solutions of the output firing rate are found in the limit of short and long correlation time scales.",Human
A study of the electron identification and selection efficiency of the L1 Trigger algorithm has been performed using the combined ECAL/HCAL test beam data. A detailed discussion of the electron isolation and its impact on the selection efficiency is presented. The L1 electron algorithm is studied for different beam energies and the results indicate that efficiencies of 98% or more can be achieved for electrons with energies between 15 and 100 GeV. The fraction of charged hadrons with energies from 3 up to 100 GeV rejected by the L1 electron trigger algorithm is estimated to be larger than 93%.,Human
"There is significant interest in RHIC heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$5--50 GeV, motivated by a search for the QCD phase transition critical point. The lowest energies for this search are well below the nominal RHIC gold injection collision energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=19.6$ GeV. There are several operations challenges at RHIC in this regime, including longitudinal acceptance, magnet field quality, lattice control, and luminosity monitoring. We report on the status of work to address these challenges, including results from beam tests of low energy RHIC operations with protons and gold, and potential improvements from different beam cooling scenarios.",Human
"In a previous work arXiv:physics/0611108v2, it was shown that the volume spanned by a molecular system in its conformational space can be effectively bounded by a polyhedral cone, this cone is described by means of a simple combinatorial formula. On the other hand it was constructed a transversal graph structure encoding the region of conformational space accessible to the system.   From the information in this graph, it is possible to decompose the main cone into a hierarchy of smaller ones that are more manageable, and are progressively more tightly bound to the region in which the system evolves.",Human
"New technologies based on the exploitation of so-called ""second order"" quantum phenomena - such as quantum entanglement - deserve a public-friendly, rational, and sexy name. Spookytechnology is that unifying term. From historical and motivational perspectives, this name has greater value than the many variations of quantum this and quantum that presently used. As many already believe, the pursuit of spookytechnology has profound implications for the development of the physical and information sciences and ultimately for society at large. Spookytechnology will find its place in the increasingly dense line of major technological revolutions of our time: quantum, info, bio, nano, spooky.",Human
"Competitive exclusion, a key principle of ecology, can be generalized to understand many other complex systems. Individuals under surviving pressure tend to be different from others, and correlations among them change correspondingly to the updating of their states. We show with numerical simulation that these aptitudes can contribute to group formation or speciation in social fields. Moreover, they can lead to power-law topological correlations of complex networks. By coupling updating states of nodes with variation of connections in a network, structural properties with power-laws and functions like multifractality, spontaneous ranking and evolutionary branching of node states can emerge out simultaneously from the present self-organized model of coevolutionary process.",Human
"The optical properties of the inflorescence of the high-altitude ''Leontopodium nivale'' subsp. ''alpinum'' (edelweiss) is investigated, in relation with its submicrometer structure, as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The filaments forming the hair layer have been found to exhibit an internal structure which may be one of the few examples of a photonic structure found in a plant. Measurements of light transmission through a self-supported layer of hair pads taken from the bracts supports the idea that the wooly layer covering the plant absorbs near-ultraviolet radiation before it reaches the cellular tissue. Calculations based on a photonic-crystal model provides insight on the way radiation can be absorbed by the filamentary threads.",Human
"We first give a short review of the ``local-current approximation'' (LCA), derived from a general variation principle, which serves as a semiclassical description of strongly collective excitations in finite fermion systems starting from their quantum-mechanical mean-field ground state. We illustrate it for the example of coupled translational and compressional dipole excitations in metal clusters. We then discuss collective electronic dipole excitations in C$_{60}$ molecules (Buckminster fullerenes). We show that the coupling of the pure translational mode (``surface plasmon'') with compressional volume modes in the semiclasscial LCA yields semi-quantitative agreement with microscopic time-dependent density functional (TDLDA) calculations, while both theories yield qualitative agreement with the recent experimental observation of a ``volume plasmon''.",Human
"In the cutting process, machine-tools vibrations are generally a real problem when the amplitude crosses the limits of dimensional or surface quality workpiece precision required. It is necessary to develop models taking into account the three-dimensional vibratory approach to control the vibrations phenomena. An experimental study has been realized to understand the behavior of the cutting system and to identify its vibrations properties. The displacement's localization of the tool in a spatial plan, showed by the experimental results, allows us to simplify the three-dimensional dynamical model. In this study, the experimental approach is completely presented and the first points of the three dimensional vibratory model are proposed according to the experimental results.",Human
"We study the energy distribution of ultrarelativistic electrons produced when a beam of 33 TeV Pb$^{81+}$(1s) ions penetrates a thin Al foil. We show that, because of a prominent role of the excitations of the ions inside the foil which becomes possible due to the relativistic time dilatation, the width of this distribution can be much narrower compared to the case when the ions interact with rarefied gaseous targets. We also show that a very similar shape of the energy distribution may arise when 33 TeV Pb$^{82+}$ ions penetrate a thin Au foil. These results shed some light on the origin of the very narrow electron energy distributions observed experimentally about a decade ago.",Human
"We describe a model of electron transfer reactions affected by local binding to the donor or acceptor sites of a particle in equilibrium with the solution. The statistics of fluctuations of the donor-acceptor energy gap caused by binding/unbinding events are non-Gaussian, and the resulting free energy surfaces of electron transfer are non-parabolic. The band-width of the charge-transfer optical transition is predicted to pass through a maximum as a function of the concentration of binding particles in the solution. The model is used to rationalize recent observations of pH-dependence of electron transfer rates involving changes in the protonation state of the donor-acceptor complex.",Human
The comparison of numerical data with published plots is a frequently occurring task. In this article I present a short computer program written in Java(TM) helping in those cases where someone wants to get the numbers out of a plot but is not able to read the plot with a decent accuracy and cannot contact the author of the plot directly for whatever reason. The accuracy reached by this method depends on many factors. For the examples illustrated in this paper a precision at the level of a few per mille could be reached. The tool might help in improving the quality of future publications.,Human
"Novel aspects of human dynamics and social interactions are investigated by means of mobile phone data. Using extensive phone records resolved in both time and space, we study the mean collective behavior at large scales and focus on the occurrence of anomalous events. We discuss how these spatiotemporal anomalies can be described using standard percolation theory tools. We also investigate patterns of calling activity at the individual level and show that the interevent time of consecutive calls is heavy-tailed. This finding, which has implications for dynamics of spreading phenomena in social networks, agrees with results previously reported on other human activities.",Human
"An algorithm, based on numerical description of the terms of many-body perturbation theory (Goldstone diagrams), is presented. The algorithm allows the use of the same piece of computer code to evaluate any particular diagram in any specific order of the perturbation theory or to calculate similar terms in other areas of the many-body theory, like e.g. terms in the coupled-cluster equations. The use of the algorithm is illustrated by calculating the second and third order correlation corrections to the removal energies of electrons from the ground state of sodium, copper and gallium and by calculating the hyperfine structure constants of sodium in the linearized single-double coupled cluster approximation.",Human
"Classical MD data on the charge-charge dynamic structure factor of two-component plasmas (TCP) modeled in Phys. Rev. A 23, 2041 (1981) are analyzed using the sum rules and other exact relations. The convergent power moments of the imaginary part of the model system dielectric function are expressed in terms of its partial static structure factors, which are computed by the method of hypernetted chains using the Deutsch effective potential. High-frequency asymptotic behavior of the dielectric function is specified to include the effects of inverse bremsstrahlung. The agreement with the MD data is improved, and important statistical characteristics of the model TCP, such as the probability to find both electron and ion at one point, are determined.",Human
"Nonadiabatic corrections in molecules composed of a few atoms are considered. It is demonstrated that a systematic perturbative expansion around the adiabatic solution is possible, with the expansion parameter being the electron-nucleus mass ratio to the power 3/4. Closed form formulae for the leading corrections to the wave function and to the energy are derived. Their applicability is demonstrated by a comparison of numerical results for the hydrogen molecule with the former nonadiabatic calculations and the experimental values. Good agreement with the recent experiment is achieved for the ground state dissociation energy of both H$_2$ and D$_2$.",Human
"We consider the transformation for the point rotation frames with the angle, spatial coordinate along the axis of rotation and time as variables. The problem arises when light, propagating through 3-fold electrooptical crystal, is modulated by the circularly polarized electromagnetic wave traveling along the optical axis of the crystal. With help of the transformation we show that such a wave cannot produce an extra optical frequency shift discussed earlier. In contrast to that the modulation by the rotating spatially invariable electric field produces the shift. The formal change to this case may be carried out by reducing the velocity of the traveling wave to zero. Some properties of the three-dimensional transformation are discussed.",Human
"We report a new class of self-similar solutions for plasma expanding into vacuum that allows for quasi-monoenergetic ion spectra. A simple analytical model takes into account externally controlled time-dependent temperature of the hot electrons. When the laser temporal profile is tailored properly, the quasi-neutral self-similar expansion of the plasma results in ion concentration in the phase-space at a particular velocity thus producing a quasi-monoenergetic spectrum. We prove this analytical prediction using a 1D partice-in-cell (PIC) simulation where the time-dependent plasma temperature is controlled by two laser pulses shot at a foil at a suitable time delay.",Human
"The interaction between a laminar boundary layer and an open cavity is investigated experimentally for Reynolds numbers between 860 and 32300. Flow visualizations are carried out for different observation directions in order to understand the spatial development of dynamical structures. The study is conducted by changing the cavity length and height and the external flow velocity, and therefore the flow patterns inside the cavity. The issue is to emphasize the three-dimensional development of the flow. In particular, we show that the cavity dynamical structures are not due to secondary shear layer instabilities. G\""ortler-type vortices are developing inside the cavity for some parameters and their properties are discussed. The existence diagram of these instabilities is also provided.",Human
"The 6.1, 6.9 and 7.1 MeV photon yields in the reaction with protons in the 1.32 to 1.42 MeV energy range were determined from the comparison between experimental and simulated spectrum. The gamma-ray spectra were measured with a HPGe detector which was 72.5 mm in diameter and 60.5 mm in length. The reaction kinematics and the detector response function were simulated by different programs using the Monte Carlo method. The relative photon yields were obtained from the least-squares fit of the experimental gamma-ray spectra to the convolution of the detector response function with the photon energy distribution arising from the reaction kinematics.",Human
"A simple study of the relationship between the QBO and the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic, both in the Basin and hitting the U.S. coastline, demonstrates that the QBO is not a particularly useful index to help predict hurricane numbers on five-year time scales. It is shown that there is very little difference between the number of hurricanes following easterly winds in the equatorial stratosphere and the number that follow westerly winds. Given this it is reasonable one would make better predictions just using the mean number of hurricanes in lieu of using the QBO and this is also simply demonstrated here.",Human
"Statistical physics has proven to be a very fruitful framework to describe phenomena outside the realm of traditional physics. The last years have witnessed the attempt by physicists to study collective phenomena emerging from the interactions of individuals as elementary units in social structures. Here we review the state of the art by focusing on a wide list of topics ranging from opinion, cultural and language dynamics to crowd behavior, hierarchy formation, human dynamics, social spreading. We highlight the connections between these problems and other, more traditional, topics of statistical physics. We also emphasize the comparison of model results with empirical data from social systems.",Human
"The fundamental diagram for tunnel traffic is constructed based on the empirical data collected during the last two years in the deep long branch of the Lefortovo tunnel located on the 3$^\text{rd}$ circular highway of Moscow. This tunnel of length 3 km is equipped with a dense system of stationary radiodetetors distributed uniformly along it chequerwise at spacing of 60 m. The data were averaged over 30 s. Each detector measures three characteristics of the vehicle ensemble; the flow rate, the car velocity, and the occupancy for three lanes individually. The conducted analysis reveals an original complex structure of the fundamental diagram.",Human
"We present total cross sections for single and double ionization of helium by antiproton impact over a wide range of impact energies from 10 keV/amu to 1 MeV/amu. A non-perturbative time-dependent close-coupling method (TDCC) is applied to fully treat the correlated dynamics of the ionized electrons. Excellent agreement is obtained between our calculations and experimental measurements of total single and double ionization cross sections at high impact energies, whereas for lower impact energies, some discrepancies with experiment are found. At an impact energy of 1 MeV we also find that the double-to-single ionization ratio is twice as large for antiproton impact as for proton impact, confirming a long-standing unexpected experimental measurement.",Human
"We use extreme-ultraviolet interferometry to measure the phase of high-order harmonic generation from transiently aligned CO2 molecules. We unambiguously observe a reversal in phase of the high order harmonic emission for higher harmonic orders with a sufficient degree of alignment. This results from molecular-scale quantum interferences between the molecular electronic wave function and the recolliding electron as it recombines with the molecule, and is consistent with a two-center model. Furthermore, using the combined harmonic intensity and phase information, we extract accurate information on the dispersion relation of the returning electron wavepacket as a function of harmonic order. This analysis shows evidence of the effect of the molecular potential on the recolliding electron wave.",Human
"In the present work we study numerical solution of the radial Dirac equation in a specific case - ab-initio pseudopotential generating process - which is needed within the electronic structure calculations using a Density Functional Theory (DFT) combined with a pseudopotential method. We give a brief introduction to DFT, derive the radial Dirac and Schrodinger equations, show how to solve them both for a given energy and as an eigenvalue problem using a known asymptotic behavior of the solution. Next we compare the nonrelativistic and relativistic eigenvalues for one electron atom. Finally we state a few words about the computer implementation.",Human
"Using a new general approach to limits in optical structures that counts orthogonal waves generated by scattering, we derive an upper limit to the number of bits of delay possible in one-dimensional slow light structures that are based on linear optical response to the signal field. The limit is essentially the product of the length of the structure in wavelengths and the largest relative change in dielectric constant anywhere in the structure at any frequency of interest. It holds for refractive index, absorption or gain variations with arbitrary spectral or spatial form. It is otherwise completely independent of the details of the structure's design, and does not rely on concepts of group velocity or group delay.",Human
"This last Part IV is aimed at deriving relaxation rates (times) of an off-center Li+ impurity. We follow Christov's reaction rate method to define general rate equations in terms of the exact Mathieu eigenvalues, as well as of harmonic-oscillator eigenvalues approximating for the energy spectrum near the bottom of the reorientational wells. To calculate the rate in each particular case, we derive configurational tunneling probabilities by either Mathieu eigenfunctions or by harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions. The electron-transfer probability is calculated by generalizing Landau-Zener's method. Typical examples are considered and compared with experimental relaxation times in KCl:Li+.",Human
"We study traffic clearance distributions (i.e., the instantaneous gap between successive vehicles) and time headway distributions by applying Beck and Cohen's superstatistics. We model the transition from free phase to congested phase with the increase of vehicle density as a transition from the Poisson statistics to that of the random matrix theory. We derive an analytic expression for the spacing distributions that interpolates from the Poisson distribution and Wigner's surmise and apply it to the distributions of the nett distance and time gaps among the succeeding cars at different densities of traffic flow. The obtained distribution fits the experimental results for single-vehicle data of the Dutch freeway A9 and the German freeway A5.",Human
"Tin coupons were shock damaged/melted under identical conditions with a diverging high explosive shock wave. Proton Radiography images and velocimetry data from experiments with seven different tin coupons of varying thickness are analyzed. Comparing experiments with identical samples allowed us to distinguish between repeatable and random features. Shapes and velocities of the main fragments are deterministic functions of the coupon thickness; random differences exist only at a small scale. Velocities of the leading layer and of the main fragment differ by the same value independently of coupon thicknesses, which is likely related to the separation energy of metal layers.",Human
"This work analyzes the dynamics of inhomogeneous, magnetically focused high-intensity beams of charged particles. While for homogeneous beams the whole system oscillates with a single frequency, any inhomogeneity leads to propagating transverse density waves which eventually result in a singular density build up, causing wave breaking and jet formation. The theory presented in this paper allows to analytically calculate the time at which the wave breaking takes place. It also gives a good estimate of the time necessary for the beam to relax into the final stationary state consisting of a cold core surrounded by a halo of highly energetic particles.",Human
"We present a criteria for necessary conditions for instanton formation of an energy packet from a prior to our present universe, using the Reissnor-Nordstrom metric which is congruent with Crowell's pseudo time evolution version of Wheeler De Witt equation. This is based upon Wesson's (1999) treatment of instanton formation in five dimensional cosmologies. Criteria for break up of this instanton is proposed due to a causal barrier derived from first principles From the Friedmann equation for scale factor evolution, with a discussion of how this can be linked to Seth Lloyd's treatment of computational bits of 'information' in different periods of inflationary cosmology",Human
"A description for regulatory genetic network based on generalized potential energy is constructed. The potential energy is derived from the steady state solution of linearized Fokker-Plank equation, and the result is shown to be equivalent to the system of coupled oscillators. The correspondence between the quantities from the mechanical picture and the steady-state fluctuations is established. Explicit calculation is given for auto-regulatory networks in which, the force constant associated with the degree of protein is very weak. Negative feedback not only suppresses the fluctuations but also increases the steepness of the potential. The results for the fluctuations agree completely with those obtained from linear noise Fokker-Planck equation.",Human
"We provide a theory of dynamo ($\alpha$ effect) and momentum transport in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics. For the first time, we show that the $\alpha$ effect is severely reduced by the shear even in the absence of magnetic field. The $\alpha$ effect is further suppressed by magnetic fields well below equipartition (with the large-scale flow) with different scalings depending on the relative strength of shear and magnetic field. The turbulent viscosity is also found to be significantly reduced by shear and magnetic fields, with positive value. These results suggest a crucial effect of shear and magnetic field on dynamo quenching and momentum transport reduction, with important implications for laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, in particular for the dynamics of the Sun.",Human
"The emission characteristics of intense laser driven protons are controlled using ultra-strong (of the order of 10^9 V/m) electrostatic fields varying on a few ps timescale. The field structures are achieved by exploiting the high potential of the target (reaching multi-MV during the laser interaction). Suitably shaped targets result in a reduction in the proton beam divergence, and hence an increase in proton flux while preserving the high beam quality. The peak focusing power and its temporal variation are shown to depend on the target characteristics, allowing for the collimation of the inherently highly divergent beam and the design of achromatic electrostatic lenses.",Human
"We present a novel method for reconstructing the shape of an object from measured gradient data. A certain class of optical sensors does not measure the shape of an object, but its local slope. These sensors display several advantages, including high information efficiency, sensitivity, and robustness. For many applications, however, it is necessary to acquire the shape, which must be calculated from the slopes by numerical integration. Existing integration techniques show drawbacks that render them unusable in many cases. Our method is based on approximation employing radial basis functions. It can be applied to irregularly sampled, noisy, and incomplete data, and it reconstructs surfaces both locally and globally with high accuracy.",Human
We resolve the existing controversy concerning the selection of the sign of the normal-to-the-interface component of the wave-vector $k_z$ of an electromagnetic wave in an active (gain) medium. Our method exploits the fact that no ambiguity exists in the case of a {\em film} of the active medium since its coefficient of reflectance is invariant under the inversion of the sign of $k_z$. Then we show that the limit of the infinite film thickness determines a unique and physically consistent choice of the wave-vector and the refractive index. Practically important implications of the theory are identified and discussed.,Human
"We present a novel technique to phase-lock two lasers with controllable frequency difference. In our setup, one sideband of a current modulated Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) is phase locked to the master laser by injection seeding, while another sideband of the VCSEL is used to phase lock the slave laser. The slave laser is therefore locked in phase with the master laser, with a frequency difference tunable up to about 35 GHz. The sideband suppression rate of the slave laser is more than 30dB at 30 uW seed power. The heterodyne spectrum between master and slave has a linewidth of less than 1 Hz. A coherent population trapping resonance of rubidium is achieved using such beams.",Human
"The bacterium E. coli maneuvers itself to regions with high chemoattractant concentrations by performing two stereotypical moves: `runs', in which it moves in near straight lines, and `tumbles', in which it does not advance but changes direction randomly. The duration of each move is stochastic and depends upon the chemoattractant concentration experienced in the recent past. We relate this stochastic behavior to the steady-state density of a bacterium population, and we derive the latter as a function of chemoattractant concentration. In contrast to earlier treatments, here we account for the effects of temporal correlations and variable tumbling durations. A range of behaviors obtains, that depends subtly upon several aspects of the system - memory, correlation, and tumbling stochasticity in particular.",Human
"We describe the evolution of a paraxial electromagnetic wave characterizing by a non-uniform polarization distribution with singularities and propagating in a weakly anisotropic medium. Our approach is based on the Stokes vector evolution equation applied to a non-uniform initial polarization field. In the case of a homogeneous medium, this equation is integrated analytically. This yields a 3-dimensional distribution of the polarization parameters containing singularities, i.e. C-lines of circular polarization and L-surfaces of linear polarization. The general theory is applied to specific examples of the unfolding of a vectorial vortex in birefringent and dichroic media.",Human
"It is shown that the energy of protons accelerated in laser-matter interaction experiments may be significantly increased through the process of splitting the incoming laser pulse into multiple interaction stages of equal intensity. From a thermodynamic point of view, the splitting procedure can be viewed as an effective way of increasing the efficiency of energy transfer from the laser light to protons, which peaks for processes having the least amount of entropy gain. It is predicted that it should be possible to achieve $\apprge 100%$ increase in the energy efficiency in a six-stage laser proton accelerator compared to a single laser-target interaction scheme.",Human
"We present a novel method for detecting communities in bipartite networks. Based on an extension of the $k$-clique community detection algorithm, we demonstrate how modular structure in bipartite networks presents itself as overlapping bicliques. If bipartite information is available, the bi-clique community detection algorithm retains all of the advantages of the $k$-clique algorithm, but avoids discarding important structural information when performing a one-mode projection of the network. Further, the bi-clique community detection algorithm provides a new level of flexibility by incorporating independent clique thresholds for each of the non-overlapping node sets in the bipartite network.",Human
"We compute absolute binding affinities for two ligands bound to the FKBP protein using non-equilibrium unbinding simulations. The methodology is straight-forward, requiring little or no modification to many modern molecular simulation packages. The approach makes use of a physical pathway, eliminating the need for complicated alchemical decoupling schemes. Results of this study are promising. For the ligands studied here the binding affinities are typically estimated within less than 4.0 kJ/mol of the target values; and the target values are within less than 1.0 kJ/mol of experiment. These results suggest that non-equilibrium simulation could provide a simple and robust means to estimate protein-ligand binding affinities.",Human
"On a laboratory-scale testing platform of impinging entrained-flow gasifier with four opposed burners, the flame images for diesel combustion and gasification process were measured with a single charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The two-dimensional multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis was employed to investigate the multifractal nature of the flame images. Sound power-law scaling in the annealed average of detrended fluctuations was unveiled when the order $q>0$ and the multifractal feature of flame images were confirmed. Further analyses identified two multifractal parameters, the minimum and maximum singularity $\alpha_{\min}$ and $\alpha_{\max}$, serving as characteristic parameters of the multifractal flames. These two characteristic multifractal parameters vary with respect to different experimental conditions.",Human
"In the course of the years the names of Korteweg and de Vries have come to be closely associated. The equation which is named after them plays a fundamental role in the theory of non-linear partial differential equations. What are the origins of the doctoral dissertation of De Vries and of the Korteweg-de Vries paper? Bastiaan Willink, a distant relative of both of these mathematicians, has sought to answer these questions. This article is based on a lecture delivered by the author at the symposium dedicated to Korteweg and de Vries at University of Amsterdam in September 2003.",Human
"We study radiation-matter interaction in a system of ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice in a Mott insulator phase. We develop a fully general quantum model, and we perform calculations for a one-dimensional geometry at normal incidence. Both two- and three-level $\Lambda$ atomic configurations are studied. The polariton dispersion and the reflectivity spectra are characterized in the different regimes, for both semi-infinite and finite-size geometries. We apply this model to propose a photon energy lifter experiment: a device which is able to shift the carrier frequency of a slowly travelling wavepacket without affecting the pulse shape nor its coherence.",Human
"GDP/capita correlations are investigated in various time windows (TW), for the time interval 1990-2005. The target group of countries is the set of 25 EU members, 15 till 2004 plus the 10 countries which joined EU later on. The TW-means of the statistical correlation coefficients are taken as the weights (links) of a fully connected network having the countries as nodes. Thereafter we define and introduce the overlapping index of weighted network nodes. A cluster structure of EU countries is derived from the statistically relevant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix. This may be considered to yield some information about the structure, stability and evolution of the EU country clusters in a macroeconomic sense.",Human
"Multiple scattering theory is applied to low-energy electron collisions with a complex target formed of two molecular scatterers. The total T-matrix is expressed in terms of the T-matrix for each isolated molecule. We apply the approach to elastic electron-(H2O)2 collisions. Following the method developed in our previous work on crystalline ice, we impose a cut-off on the dipole outside the R-matrix sphere and an energy dependent cut-off on the angular momentum components of the monomer T-matrix. An R-matrix calculation of electron-dimer collisions is performed in order to evaluate the accuracy of the multiple scattering approach. The agreement between the two calculations is very good.",Human
"We show how accurate kinetic information, such as the rates of protein folding and unfolding, can be extracted from replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. From the brief and continuous trajectory segments between replica exchanges, we estimate short-time propagators in conformation space and use them to construct a master equation. For a helical peptide in explicit water, we determine the rates of transitions both locally between microscopic conformational states and globally for folding and unfolding. We show that accurate rates in the ~1/(100 ns) to ~1/(1 ns) range can be obtained from REMD with exchange times of 5 ps, in excellent agreement with results from long equilibrium molecular dynamics.",Human
"A quantum mechanical theory of the relationship between perceptions and brain dynamics based on von Neumann's theory of measurments is applied to a recent quantum theoretical treatment of binocular rivaly that makes essential use of the quantum Zeno effect to give good fits to the complex available empirical data. The often-made claim that decoherence effects in the warm, wet, noisy brain must eliminate quantum effects at the macroscopic scale pertaining to perceptions is examined, and it is argued, on the basis of fundamental principles. that the usual decoherence effects will not upset the quantum Zeno effect that is being exploited in the cited work.",Human
"AgInSe2 nanorods (NRs) with diameter of 15 nm have been investigated for their nonlinear optical responses by using Z-scan and transient absorption techniques with femtosecond laser pulses of photon energy greater than the bandgap. At excitation irradiance of 20 GW/cm2, AgInSe2 NRs reveal saturation in the nonlinear absorption and optical Kerr nonlinearity with a recovery time determined to be a few ten picoseconds. Such large saturable absorption and Kerr nonlinearity exhibit a third-order susceptibility of 1.2 x 10-8 esu and a figure of merit of 0.04 esu.cm.s-1, making AgInSe2 NRs a promising candidate for saturable absorption devices.",Human
"An overview and status report of the new trapping facility for highly charged ions at the Gesellschaft fuer Schwerionenforschung is presented. The construction of this facility started in 2005 and is expected to be completed in 2008. Once operational, highly charged ions will be loaded from the experimental storage ring ESR into the HITRAP facility, where they are decelerated and cooled. The kinetic energy of the initially fast ions is reduced by more than fourteen orders of magnitude and their thermal energy is cooled to cryogenic temperatures. The cold ions are then delivered to a broad range of atomic physics experiments.",Human
"The ${\bm E}\times{\bm B}$ drift motion of charged test particle dynamics in the Scrape Off Layer (SOL)is analyzed to investigate a transport control strategy based on Hamiltonian dynamics. We model SOL turbulence using a 2D non-linear fluid code based on interchange instability which was found to exhibit intermittent dynamics of the particle flux. The effect of a small and appropriate modification of the turbulent electric potential is studied with respect to the chaotic diffusion of test particle dynamics. Over a significant range in the magnitude of the turbulent electrostatic field, a three-fold reduction of the test particle diffusion coefficient is achieved.",Human
"The fully relativistic theory of the g factor of Li-like ions with nonzero nuclear spin is considered for the (1s)^2 2s state. The magnetic-dipole hyperfine-interaction correction to the atomic g factor is calculated including the one-electron contributions as well as the interelectronic-interaction effects of order 1/Z. This correction is combined with the interelectronic-interaction, QED, nuclear recoil, and nuclear size corrections to obtain high-precision theoretical values for the g factor of Li-like ions with nonzero nuclear spin. The results can be used for a precise determination of nuclear magnetic moments from g factor experiments.",Human
"A survey is presented of the work done so far to check earlier claims that a fine structure may be observed to occur under certain circumstances in the impurity spectral range of the optical absorption spectra of silver halides following photostimulation in the intrinsic range. This structure, associated with the photochemical formation of silver specks, has been questioned over the years. We now weigh carefully the experimental evidence on the silver halides against a background of similar data on the alkali halides, where competing processes run slower. We come to the conclusion that present day advances in experimental techniques may be quite adequate for providing a solid experimental basis to solve the problem unambiguously.",Human
"If there is a null gradient field in 1+3 dimensional space-time, we can set up a kind of light-cone coordinate system in the space-time. In such coordinate system, the metric takes a simple form, which is much helpful for simplifying and solving the Einstein's field equation. This light-cone coordinate system has wonderful properties and has been widely used in astrophysics to calculate parameters. In this paper, we give a detailed discussion for the structure of space-time with light-cone coordinate system. We derive the conditions for existence of such coordinate system, and show how to construct the light-cone coordinate system from usual ones, then explain their geometrical and physical meanings by examples.",Human
We have demonstrated efficient intersubband electroabsorption in InGaAs/InAlGaAs/InAlAs step quantum wells grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). An absorption modulation of 6 dB at $\lambda=6.0 \mu$m due to Stark shift of the IS absorption was achieved at a low voltage swing of $\pm 0.5$ V in a multipass waveguide structure. Based on the experimental results it is estimated that an electroabsorption modulator with a low peak-to-peak voltage of $V_{pp}=0.9$ V can yield a modulation speed of $f_{3dB} \approx 120$ GHz with the present material by using a strongly confining surface plasmon waveguide of 30 $\mu$m length.,Human
"It is introduced inertial anti-gravitational potential into the theory of gravity to stop gravitational collapse at the nuclear density and thus prevent singularities. It is considered effective gravity which includes Newtonian potential and inertial anti-gravitational potential. It is investigated footprints of the effective gravity in the solar system. The inertial anti-gravitational potential of the sun allows to explain the anomalous acceleration of Pioneer 10 and 11, the anomalous increase in the lunar semi-major axis, the residuals of the seasonal variation of the proper angular velocity of the earth, the anomalous increase of the Astronomical Unit, the anomalous shift of the perihelion of mercury.",Human
"Calorimeter-assisted track finding algorithm takes advantage of the finely segmented electromagnetic calorimeter proposed for the SiD detector concept by looking for ""MIP stubs"" produced by charged particles in the calorimeter, and using them as seeds for pattern recognition in the tracker. The algorithm allows for efficient reconstruction of tracks that cannot be found using seeds provided by the vertex detector, even if standalone pattern recognition in the outer tracker is difficult. The algorithm has been implemented as a package in the org.lcsim framework. Current status of the package and its performance in non-prompt tracks reconstruction are described.",Human
"Stochasticity is one of the most extensively researched topics in laboratory and space plasmas since it has been successful in explaining the various anomalous processes like transport, particle heating, particle loss etc. Since there is a growing need for better understanding of this nonlinear process, it has led to the development of new and more advanced data analysis techniques. In this paper we present an analysis of the floating potential fluctuations which show the existence of a stochastic multifractal process along with low dimensional chaos. This has been shown primarily by wavelet analysis, and cross checked using other nonlinear techniques.",Human
"We study the chirality of ground-state alkali atoms in E and B fields, dressed with a circularly-polarized laser beam close-detuned from an E-field-assisted forbidden transition, such as 7S-8S in Fr. We predict a parity violating energy shift of their sublevels, linear in E, and the weak nuclear charge Q_W$. A dressing beam of 10 kW/cm$^2$ at 506 nm produces a shift of $\sim100 \mu$Hz at E=100 V/cm, B $\gtrsim$30 mG. It should be observable with $\sim 10^4$ Fr atoms confined in an optical dipole trap. We discuss optimal conditions, parameter reversals and a calibration procedure to measure $Q_W$.",Human
"We extend the method of Huygens' construction in a uniformly moving optical medium [Am. J. Phys. 72, 934 (2004)] to the case when the medium is dispersive in its rest frame of reference. The first-order Huygens' construction analysis of the light drag in a transversely moving dispersive slab is in agreement with the results of the experiment by Jones (1975) and with the Player-Rogers formula for the downstream deflection of the beam. The derivation purports that the original Huygens' principle remains valid in non-stationary situations if it is modified to include the relativistic effects on the secondary wavelets caused by the motion of the medium.",Human
"Recently, increasing empirical evidence indicates the extensive existence of heavy tails in the interevent time distributions of various human behaviors. Based on the queuing theory, the Barab\'asi model and its variations suggest the highest-priority-first protocol a potential origin of those heavy tails. However, some human activity patterns, also displaying the heavy-tailed temporal statistics, could not be explained by a task-based mechanism. In this paper, different from the mainstream, we propose an interest-based model. Both the simulation and analysis indicate a power-law interevent time distribution with exponent -1, which is in accordance with some empirical observations in human-initiated systems.",Human
"Discrete systems with long-range interactions are considered. Continuous medium models as continuous limit of discrete chain system are defined. Long-range interactions of chain elements that give the fractional equations for the medium model are discussed. The chain equations of motion with long-range interaction are mapped into the continuum equation with the Riesz fractional derivative. We formulate the consistent definition of continuous limit for the systems with long-range interactions. In this paper, we consider a wide class of long-range interactions that give fractional medium equations in the continuous limit. The power-law interaction is a special case of this class.",Human
"The Weibel instability is analyzed for quantum plasmas described by the Wigner-Maxwell model. For a suitable class of electromagnetic potentials, the Wigner-Maxwell system is linearized yielding a general dispersion relation for transverse electromagnetic waves. For a double Gaussian equilibrium with temperature anisotropy, the derived dispersion relation generalizes the classical Weibel instability equation. More detailed analytical results are obtained for the cases of extreme temperature anisotropy and for a three-dimensional water bag distribution. In all cases, quantum effects tends to weaken or suppress the instability. Applications are discussed for dense astrophysical objects like white dwarfs and neutron stars as well as for tunnel-ionized plasmas with controllable perpendicular plasma temperature.",Human
"In the present article we use the quantum formalism to describe the effects of risk and ambiguity in decision theory. The main idea is that the probabilities in the classic theory of expected utility are estimated probabilities, and thus do not follow the classic laws of probability theory. In particular, we show that it is possible to use consistently the classic expected utility formula, where the probability associated to the events are computed with the equation of quantum interference. Thus we show that the correct utility of a lottery can be simply computed by adding to the classic expected utility a new corrective term, the uncertainty utility, directly connected with the quantum interference term.",Human
The design and performance of a compact heated vapor cell unit for realizing a dichroic atomic vapor laser lock (DAVLL) for the D2 transitions in atomic rubidium is described. A 5 cm-long vapor cell is placed in a double-solenoid arrangement to produce the required magnetic field; the heat from the solenoid is used to increase the vapor pressure and correspondingly the DAVLL signal. We have characterized experimentally the dependence of important features of the DAVLL signal on magnetic field and cell temperature. For the weaker transitions both the amplitude and gradient of the signal are increased by an order of magnitude.,Human
"Tunnel ionization of room-temperature D$_2$ in an ultrashort (12 femtosecond) near infra-red (800 nm) pump laser pulse excites a vibrational wavepacket in the D2+ ions; a rotational wavepacket is also excited in residual D2 molecules. Both wavepacket types are collapsed a variable time later by an ultrashort probe pulse. We isolate the vibrational wavepacket and quantify its evolution dynamics through theoretical comparison. Requirements for quantum computation (initial coherence and quantum state retrieval) are studied using this well-defined (small number of initial states at room temperature, initial wavepacket spatially localized) single-electron molecular prototype by temporally stretching the pump and probe pulses.",Human
"Comment on Effects of transverse magnetic field on mixed convection in wall plume of power-law fluids, by Rama Subba Reddy Gorla, Jin Kook Lee, Shoichiro Nakamura and Ioan Pop [International Journal of Engineering Science, 31 (1993) 1035-1045]. In the above paper the authors treat the boundary layer mixed convection flow of a power-law fluid along a vertical adiabatic surface in a transverse magnetic field with a steady thermal source at the leading edge. The governing non-similar equations are solved by means of a novel finite difference scheme. However, there are two fundamental errors in this paper and the presented results do not have any practical value.",Human
"We propose a practical and efficient solution for the coupling of light from integrated single-mode waveguides to supercollimating planar photonic crystals on conventional silicon-on-insulator platforms. The device consists of a rib waveguide, designed to sustain spatially extended single-modes and matched to a supercollimating photonic crystal, which has been truncated at its boundary to improve impedance matching between the two photonic components. Three-dimensional simulations show transmission efficiencies up to 96 % and reflections below 0.2 % at wavelengths close to 1.55 microns. This approach constitutes a significant step toward the integration of supercollimating structures on photonic chips.",Human
"The aim of an invisibility device is to guide light around any object put inside, being able to hide objects from sight. In this work, we propose a novel design of dielectric invisibility media based on negative refraction and optical conformal mapping that seems to create perfect invisibility. This design has some advantages and more relaxed constraints compared with already proposed schemes. In particular, it represents an example where the time delay in a dielectric invisibility device is zero. Furthermore, due to impedance matching of negatively refracting materials, the reflection should be close to zero. These findings strongly indicate that perfect invisibility with optically isotropic materials is possible. Finally, the area of the invisible space is also discussed.",Human
"We describe an extension of multi-speckle diffusing wave spectroscopy adapted to follow the non-stationary microscopic dynamics in drying films and coatings in a very reactive way and with a high dynamic range. We call this technique ""Adaptive Speckle Imaging Interferometry"". We introduce an efficient tool, the inter-image distance, to evaluate the speckle dynamics, and the concept of ""speckle rate"" (SR, in Hz) to quantify this dynamics. The adaptive algorithm plots a simple kinetics, the time evolution of the SR, providing a non-invasive characterization of drying phenomena. A new commercial instrument, called HORUS(R), based on ASII and specialized in the analysis of film formation and drying processes is presented.",Human
"We analyze access statistics of several popular webpages for a period of several years. The graphs of daily downloads are highly non-homogeneous with long periods of low activity interrupted by bursts of heavy traffic. These bursts are due to avalanches of blog entries, referring to the page. We quantitatively explain this behavior using the theory of branching processes. We extrapolate these findings to construct a model of the entire web. According to the model, the competition between webpages for viewers pushes the web into a self-organized critical state. In this regime, the most interesting webpages are in a near-critical state, with a power law distribution of traffic intensity.",Human
"The energy momentum tensor of perfect fluid is a simplified but successful model in astrophysics. In this paper, assuming the particles driven by gravity and moving along geodesics, we derived the functions of state in detail. The results show that, these functions have a little correction for the usual thermodynamics. The new functions naturally satisfy the causal condition and consist with relativity. For the self potentials of the particles we introduce an extra function $W$, which acts like negative pressure and can be used to describe dark matter. The results are helpful to understand the relation and interaction between space-time and matter.",Human
"We consider the results of modeling of the efficiency of registration of thermal neutrons by the converters, which are made from natural gadolinium and its 157 isotope foils. Efficiency for a case of falling of neutrons under various angles to a plane of converters is calculated. It is shown, that at small angles of falling of neutrons to a plane of converters it is possible to receive the efficiency of registration close to a theoretical limit. Efficiency of the complex converter made of kapton supporting film with gadolinium converters layered on both its sides is considered. All calculations are carried out for four fixed neutron energies, which correspond to the wavelengths of 1, 1.8, 3 and 4 $\AA$.",Human
"In the present work we investigate the effects of spatial constraints on the efficiency of task execution in systems underlain by geographical complex networks where the probability of connection decreases with the distance between the nodes. The investigation considers several configurations of the parameters defining the network connectivity, and the Barabasi-Albert network model is also considered for comparisons. The results show that the effect of connectivity is significant only for shorter tasks, that the locality of connections implied by the spatial constraints reduces efficency, and that the addition of edges can improve the efficiency of the execution, although with increasing locality of the connections the improvement is small.",Human
"A formulation of bit-string models of language evolution, based on differential equations for the population speaking each language, is introduced and preliminarily studied. Connections with replicator dynamics and diffusion processes are pointed out. The stability of the dominance state, where most of the population speaks a single language, is analyzed within a mean-field-like approximation, while the homogeneous state, where the population is evenly distributed among languages, can be exactly studied. This analysis discloses the existence of a bistability region, where dominance coexists with homogeneity as possible asymptotic states. Numerical resolution of the differential system validates these findings.",Human
"We propose an approach to derive longitudinal shower development information from the longitudinally unsegmented BABAR electromagnetic calorimeter by using tracking information. Our algorithm takes advantage of the good three-dimensional tracking resolution of BABAR, which provides an independent geometric constraint on the shower as measured in the BABAR crystal calorimeter. We show that adding the derived longitudinal shower development information to standard particle identification algorithms significantly improves the low-momentum separation of pions from electrons and muons. We also verify that the energy dependence of the electromagnetic shower development we measure is consistent with the prediction of a standard electromagnetic shower model.",Human
"We propose a method to improve community division techniques in networks that are based on agglomeration by introducing dendrogram jumping. The method is based on iterations of sub-optimal dendrograms instead of optimization of each agglomeration step. We find the algorithm to exhibit excellent scaling behavior of its computational complexity. In its present form the algorithm scales as $\mathcal{O} (N^{2})$, but by using more efficient data structures it is possible to achieve a scaling of $\mathcal{O} (N \log^{2} N)$. We compare our results with other methods such as the greedy algorithm and the extremal optimization method. We find modularity values larger than the greedy algorithm and values comparable to the extremal optimization method.",Human
"We study an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game with two layered graphs, where the lower layer is the physical infrastructure on which the interactions are taking place and the upper layer represents the connections for the strategy adoption (learning) mechanism. This system is investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations and an extended pair-approximation method. We consider the average density of cooperators in the stationary state for a fixed interaction graph, while varying the number of edges in the learning graph. According to the Monte Carlo simulations, the cooperation is modified substantially in a way resembling a coherence-resonance-like behavior when the number of learning edges is increased. This behavior is reproduced by the analytical results.",Human
"We study the effects of inhomogeneous influence of individuals on collective phenomena. We focus analytically on a typical model of the majority rule, applied to the completely connected agents. Two types of individuals $A$ and $B$ with different influence activity are introduced. The individuals $A$ and $B$ are distributed randomly with concentrations $\nu$ and $1-\nu$ at the beginning and fixed further on. Our main result is that the location of the order-disorder transition is affected due to the introduction of the inhomogeneous influence. This result highlights the importance of inhomogeneous influence between different types of individuals during the process of opinion updating.",Human
"A novel formulation to dope organic liquid scintillators (OLS) with indium at concentrations up to 10% is presented: it is based on specific indium carboxylate compounds adequately synthesized. The produced In-OLS has been characterized: it has light yield 8500 ph/MeV at indium concentration 5.5% and light attenuation length of 2,5 m at wavelength of 430 nm. The scintillator properties were stable during all time of investigation (~ 1 years). The produced In-OLS is compared to other In-OLS formulations and shows superior performances. The developed methodic to metal dope OLS can be easily extended to other metals as Gd, Nd, Cd.",Human
"We have calculated the atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) induced in 229Pa and 225Ac by their respective nuclear Schiff moments S. The results are d(229Pa)= - 9.5 10^{-17} [S/(e fm)] e cm= - 1.1 10^{-20} \eta e cm; d(225Ac})=- 8.6 10^{-17} [S/(e fm)] e cm=- 0.8 10^{-21} \eta e cm. EDM of 229 Pa is 3 10^4 times larger than 199Hg EDM and 40 times larger than 225Ra EDM. Possible use of actinides in solid state experiments is also discussed. The T,P-odd spin-axis interaction in RaO molecule is 500 times larger than in TlF.",Human
"The laminar-turbulent boundary S is the set separating initial conditions which relaminarise uneventfully from those which become turbulent. Phase space trajectories on this hypersurface in cylindrical pipe flow look to be chaotic and show recurring evidence of coherent structures. A general numerical technique is developed for recognising approaches to these structures and then for identifying the exact coherent solutions themselves. Numerical evidence is presented which suggests that trajectories on S are organised around only a few travelling waves and their heteroclinic connections. If the flow is suitably constrained to a subspace with a discrete rotational symmetry, it is possible to find locally-attracting travelling waves embedded within S. Four new types of travelling waves were found using this approach.",Human
"We demonstrate interesting and previously unforeseen properties of a pair of gap solitons in a resonant photonic crystal which are predicted and explained in a physically transparent form using both analytical and numerical methods. The most important result is the fact that an oscillating gap soliton created by the presence of a localized population inversion inside the crystal can be manipulated by means of a proper choice of bit rate, phase and amplitude modulation. Developing this idea, we are able to obtain qualitatively different regimes of a resonant photonic crystal operation. In particular, a noteworthy observation is that both the delay time and amplitude difference must exceed a certain level to ensure effective control over the soliton dynamics.",Human
"The long awaited experimental results from MiniBooNE have recently been announced. This experiment tests whether neutrino oscillations can occur at a higher mass squared difference $\sim1 {eV}^2$ compared to well established observations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. The LSND experiment has previously claimed to have observed neutrino oscillations at $\Delta m^2 \sim 1 {eV}^2$, however the results being controversial, required an independent confirmation. The MiniBooNE results settle this controversy by observing null oscillations at the said mass squared difference. These results have strong implications on existence of sterile neutrinos, CPT violation and mass varying neutrinos. We review the present status of neutrino masses and mixing in the light of this recent result.",Human
"In this paper we will develop a methodology for obtaining pricing expressions for financial instruments whose underlying asset can be described through a simple continuous-time random walk (CTRW) market model. Our approach is very natural to the issue because it is based in the use of renewal equations, and therefore it enhances the potential use of CTRW techniques in finance. We solve these equations for typical contract specifications, in a particular but exemplifying case. We also show how a formal general solution can be found for more exotic derivatives, and we compare prices for alternative models of the underlying. Finally, we recover the celebrated results for the Wiener process under certain limits.",Human
We present an overview of recent progress in plasmonics. We focus our study on the observation and excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) with optical near-field microscopy. We discuss in particular recent applications of photon scanning tunnelling microscope (PSTM) for imaging of SPP propagating in metal and dielectric wave guides. We show how near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) can be used to optically and actively address remotely nano-objects such as quantum dots. Additionally we compare results obtained with near-field microscopy to those obtained with other optical far-field methods of analysis such as leakage radiation microscopy (LRM).,Human
"The structure of classical electrodynamics based on the variational principle together with causality and space-time homogeneity is analyzed. It is proved that in this case the 4-potentials are defined uniquely. On the other hand, the approach where Maxwell equations and the Lorentz law of force are regarded as cornerstones of the theory allows gauge transformations. For this reason, the two theories are not equivalent. A simple example substantiates this conclusion. Quantum physics is linked to the variational principle and it is proved that the same result holds for it. The compatibility of this conclusion with gauge invariance of the Lagrangian density is explained. Several alternative possibilities that may follow this work are pointed out.",Human
"Dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) MRI or perfusion-MRI plays an important role in the non-invasive assessment of tumor vascularity. However, the large number of images provided by the method makes display and interpretation of the results challenging. Current practice is to display the perfusion information as relative cerebral blood volume maps (rCBV). Color intensity projections (CIPs) provides a simple, intuitive display of the perfusion-MRI data so that regional perfusion characteristics are intrinsically integrated into the anatomy structure the T2 images. The ease of use and quick calculation time of CIPs should allow it to be easily integrated into current analysis and interpretation pipelines.",Human
"When fragile molecules such as glycine, polyglicine, alkanes, and alkanethiols are embedded in liquid helium nanodroplets, electron-impact ionization of the beam leads to fragmentation which is as extensive as that of isolated gas-phase molecules. However, it turns out that if a few molecules of water are co-embedded with the peptide and alkane chains, their fragmentation is drastically reduced or completely eliminated. On the other hand, the fragmentation of alkanethiols remains unaffected. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that the fragmentation ""buffering"" effect may correlate with the magnitude of the impurity's electric dipole moment, which steers the migration of the ionizing He^+ hole in the droplet.",Human
"In this paper, we study the radiation from embedded sources in two-dimensional finite-size ""photonic-quasicrystal"" (PQC) slabs made of dielectric rods arranged according to a 12-fold symmetric aperiodic tiling. The results from our investigation, based on rigorous full-wave simulations, show the possibility of achieving broadside radiation at multiple frequencies, with high-directivity (e.g., 15 dB) and low-sidelobes (e.g., -12 dB). We also show that leaky waves are supported by a PQC slab, and that the beamwidth is directly proportional to the leaky-wave attenuation constant, which provides a physically-incisive interpretation of the observed radiation characteristics.",Human
"Recently, [arXiv:0810.3134] is accepted and published. We derive an inequality with two settings as tests for the existence of the Bloch sphere in a spin-1/2 system. The probability theory of measurement outcome within the formalism of von Neumann projective measurement violates the inequality. Namely, we have to give up the existence of the Bloch sphere. Or, we have to give up the probability theory of measurement outcome within the formalism of von Neumann projective measurement. Hence it turns out that there is a contradiction in the Hilbert space formalism of the quantum theory, viz., there is no axiomatic system for the theory.",Human
"In nuclear power generation, fissile materials are mainly used. For example, $U^{235}$ is fissile and therefore quite essential for use of nuclear energy. However, the material $U^{235}$ has very small natural abundance less than 1 %. We should seek possibility of utilizing fissionable materials such as $U^{238}$ because natural abundance of such fissionable materials is generally much larger than fissile ones. In this paper, we show that thermal neutrons with vanishing kinetic energy can induce nuclear fission when high voltage is applied to fissionable materials. To obtain this result, we use the liquid-drop model for nuclei. Finally, we propose how fissionable materials can be utilized.",Human
"The success of new scientific areas can be assessed by their potential for contributing to new theoretical approaches and in applications to real-world problems. Complex networks have fared extremely well in both of these aspects, with their sound theoretical basis developed over the years and with a variety of applications. In this survey, we analyze the applications of complex networks to real-world problems and data, with emphasis in representation, analysis and modeling, after an introduction to the main concepts and models. A diversity of phenomena are surveyed, which may be classified into no less than 22 areas, providing a clear indication of the impact of the field of complex networks.",Human
"We study inelastic processes for ultracold three-body systems in which only one interaction is resonant. We have found that the decay rates for weakly bound molecules due to collisions with other atoms can be suppressed not only without fermionic statistics but also when bosonic statistics applies. In addition, we show that at ultracold temperatures three-body recombination involving a single resonant pair of atoms leads mainly to formation of weakly bound molecules which, in turn, are stable against decay. These results indicate that recombination in three-component atomic gases can be used as an efficient mechanism for molecular formation, allowing the achievement of high molecular densities.",Human
"The acceleration of ions in the interaction of circular polarized laser pulses with overdense plasmas is investigated. For circular polarization laser pulses, the quasi-equilibrium for electrons is established due to the light pressure and the electrostatic field built up at the interacting front of the laser pulse. The ions located within the skin-depth of the laser pulse can be synchronously accelerated and bunched in the charge couple processes by the electrostatic field, and thereby monoenergetic and high intensity proton beam can be generated. The dynamics equations for accelerated ions are deduced and proved by particle-in-cell simulations.",Human
"We consider the Navier-Stokes equation in a domain with irregular boundaries. The irregularity is modeled by a spatially homogeneous random process, with typical size $\eps \ll 1$. In a parent paper, we derived a homogenized boundary condition of Navier type as $\eps \to 0$. We show here that for a large class of boundaries, this Navier condition provides a $O(\eps^{3/2} |\ln \eps|^{1/2})$ approximation in $L^2$, instead of $O(\eps^{3/2})$ for periodic irregularities. Our result relies on the study of an auxiliary boundary layer system. Decay properties of this boundary layer are deduced from a central limit theorem for dependent variables.",Human
"The depletion force and depletion potential between two in principle unequal ""big"" hard spheres embedded in a multicomponent mixture of ""small"" hard spheres are computed using the Rational Function Approximation method for the structural properties of hard-sphere mixtures [S. B. Yuste, A. Santos, and M. L\'opez de Haro, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 108}, 3683 (1998)]. The cases of equal solute particles and of one big particle and a hard planar wall in a background monodisperse hard-sphere fluid are explicitly analyzed. An improvement over the performance of the Percus-Yevick theory and good agreement with available simulation results are found",Human
"The power grid defines one of the most important technological networks of our times and sustains our complex society. It has evolved for more than a century into an extremely huge and seemingly robust and well understood system. But it becomes extremely fragile as well, when unexpected, usually minimal, failures turn into unknown dynamical behaviours leading, for example, to sudden and massive blackouts. Here we explore the fragility of the European power grid under the effect of selective node removal. A mean field analysis of fragility against attacks is presented together with the observed patterns. Deviations from the theoretical conditions for network percolation (and fragmentation) under attacks are analysed and correlated with non topological reliability measures.",Human
"Supercontinua generated in highly non-linear fibers by ultrashort-pulse lasers can be used for high resolution Fourier transform absorption spectroscopy. The practical advantages of these bright ultrabroadband light sources for spectroscopy are reported in the near-infrared region. A Cr^4+:YAG femtosecond laser broadened by an extruded soft-glass photonic crystal fiber, emitting from 1200 to 2200 nm and from 675 to 950 nm, provides a spectral radiance being 1x10^5 times higher than that of a 3000 K blackbody and 10^2 times higher than that of a synchrotron radiation. The C_2H_2 and NH_3 overtone spectra are recorded using this source within a few seconds.",Human
"This paper establishes power scaling of lasers as a clearly defined concept, based on a power scaling procedure which must satisfy various criteria. It is demonstrated that this concept creates useful insight particularly for the evaluation of the future performance potential of different laser architectures, and for identifying technological aspects which will need to be modified for generating higher powers. It turns out that some aspects (such as e.g. thermal lensing in thin disk lasers) can have rather benign scaling properties, not causing problems even at very high power levels, while other aspects can become essential even if they initially may have appeared to be insignificant.",Human
"The Jacobi and Weierstrass elliptic functions used to be part of the standard mathematical arsenal of physics students. They appear as solutions of many important problems in classical mechanics: the motion of a planar pendulum (Jacobi), the motion of a force-free asymmetric top (Jacobi), the motion of a spherical pendulum (Weierstrass), and the motion of a heavy symmetric top with one fixed point (Weierstrass). The problem of the planar pendulum, in fact, can be used to construct the general connection between the Jacobi and Weierstrass elliptic functions. The easy access to mathematical software by physics students suggests that they might reappear as useful tools in the undergraduate curriculum.",Human
"Using multicanonical simulations, the authors study the effect of charged end groups on helix formation in alanine based polypeptides. They confirm earlier reports that neutral polyalanine exhibits a pronounced helix-coil transition in gas phase simulations. Introducing a charged Lys+ at the C terminal stabilizes the helix and leads to a higher transition temperature. On the other hand, adding the Lys+ at the N terminal inhibits helix formation. Instead, a more globular structure was found. These results are in agreement with recent experiments on alanine based polypeptides in gas phase. They indicate that present force fields describe accurately the intramolecular interactions in proteins.",Human
"We consider pulse propagation through a two component composite medium (metal inclusions in a dielectric host) with or without cavity mirrors. We show that a very thin slab of such a medium, under conditions of localized plasmon resonance, can lead to significant superluminality with detectable levels of transmitted pulse. A cavity containing the heterogeneous medium is shown to lead to subluminal-to-superluminal transmission depending on the volume fraction of the metal inclusions. The predictions of phase time calculations are verified by explicit calculations of the transmitted pulse shapes. We also demonstrate the independence of the phase time on system width and the volume fraction under specific conditions.",Human
"We report on a tunable all-optical delay line for pulses with optical frequency within the Rb $D_2$ absorption line. Using frequency tuning between absorption components from different isotopes, pulses of 10 ns duration are delayed in a 10 cm hot vapour cell by up to 40 ns while the transmission remains above 10%. The use of two isotopes allows the delay to be increased or decreased by optical pumping with a second laser, producing rapid tuning over a range of more than 40% of the initial delay at 110$^{\circ}$C. We investigate the frequency and intensity ranges in which this delay line can be realised. Our observations are in good agreement with a numerical model of the system.",Human
"We implement a well-established concept to consider dispersion effects within a Poisson-Boltzmann approach of continuum solvation of proteins. The theoretical framework is particularly suited for boundary element methods. Free parameters are determined by comparison to experimental data as well as high-level quantum mechanical reference calculations. The method is general and can be easily extended in several directions. The model is tested on various chemical substances and found to yield good-quality estimates of the solvation free energy without obvious indication of any introduced bias. Once optimized, the model is applied to a series of proteins, and factors such as protein size or partial charge assignments are studied.",Human
"A complete scheme for production and cooling a muon beam for three specified muon colliders is presented. Parameters for these muon colliders are given. The scheme starts with the front end of a proposed neutrino factory that yields bunch trains of both muon signs. Emittance exchange cooling in slow helical lattices reduces the longitudinal emittance until it becomes possible to merge the trains into single bunches, one of each sign. Further cooling in all dimensions is applied to the single bunches in further slow helical lattices. Final transverse cooling to the required parameters is achieved in 50 T solenoids using high Tc superconductor at 4 K. Preliminary simulations of each element are presented.",Human
"We demonstrate the coherent excitation of a mesoscopic ensemble of about 100 ultracold atoms to Rydberg states by driving Rabi oscillations from the atomic ground state. We employ a dedicated beam shaping and optical pumping scheme to compensate for the small transition matrix element. We study the excitation in a weakly interacting regime and in the regime of strong interactions. When increasing the interaction strength by pair state resonances we observe an increased excitation rate through coupling to high angular momentum states. This effect is in contrast to the proposed and previously observed interaction-induced suppression of excitation, the so-called dipole blockade.",Human
"Ultra-high frequency acoustic resonances ($\backsim$2 GHz) trapped within the glass core ($\backsim$1 $\mu$m diameter) of a photonic crystal fiber are selectively excited through electrostriction using laser pulses of duration 100 ps and energy 500 pJ. Using precisely timed sequences of such driving pulses, we achieve coherent control of the acoustic resonances by constructive or destructive interference, demonstrating both enhancement and suppression of the vibrations. A sequence of 27 resonantly-timed pulses provides a 100-fold increase in the amplitude of the vibrational mode. The results are explained and interpreted using a semi-analytical theory, and supported by precise numerical simulations of the complex light-matter interaction.",Human
"A one-coordinate gaseous detector of soft X-ray photons for wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) studies is being developed. The detector operates in counting mode and is based on multi-stage Gas Electron Multiplier(GEM). Full size detector is assembled and has 67 degrees aperture with 350mm distance to the source, readout multi-strip structure with 2048 strips at 0.2mm pitch and is partially equipped with readout electronics in the central part. Main parameters of the detector have been measured with 8keV X-ray beam at VEPP-3 synchrotron ring. Spatial resolution of 470 um (FWHM) has been demonstrated that will allow to distinguish diffraction spots at 0.1 degrees.",Human
"A mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of a small-polaron superlattice above the Curie temperature in manganites. The order-disorder transition initiated by the external field at a lattice is known responsible for the colossal resistance effect. We attribute the lattice formation to the occurrence of strong Van der Waals pairing of vibronic small polarons arising from the phonon coupling of highly polarizable two-level orbital systems. The latter having inherent electric and magnetic dipoles associated with them, they couple to the external field leading to the observed colossal effects. We find numerical estimates of the critical field compatible.",Human
"It has been observed \cite{break} that breakdown in an 805 MHz pill-box cavi ty occurs at much lower gradients as an external axial magnetic field is inc reased. This effect was not observed with on open iris cavity. It is propose d that this effect depends on the relative angles of the magnetic and maximu m electric fields: parallel in the pill-box case; at an angle in the open ir is case. If so, using an open iris structure with solenoid coils in the iris es should perform even better. A lattice, using this principle, is presented, for use in 6D cooling for a Muon Collider. Experimental layouts to test th is principle are proposed.",Human
"We investigate the spatial correlation properties of the solar wind using simultaneous observations by the ACE and WIND spacecraft. We use mutual information as a nonlinear measure of correlation and compare this to linear correlation. We find that the correlation lengthscales of fluctuations in density and magnetic field magnitude vary strongly with the solar cycle, whereas correlation lengths of fluctuations in B field components do not. We find the correlation length of |B| ~ 120 Re at solar minimum and ~ 270 Re at maximum and the correlation length of density ~ 75 Re at minimum and ~ 170 Re at minimum. The components of the B field have correlation lengths ~ correlation length |B| at minimum.",Human
"Propagation of transient mechanical waves in porous media is numerically investigated in 1D. The framework is the linear Biot's model with frequency-independant coefficients. The coexistence of a propagating fast wave and a diffusive slow wave makes numerical modeling tricky. A method combining three numerical tools is proposed: a fourth-order ADER scheme with time-splitting to deal with the time-marching, a space-time mesh refinement to account for the small-scale evolution of the slow wave, and an interface method to enforce the jump conditions at interfaces. Comparisons with analytical solutions confirm the validity of this approach.",Human
"By assuming that a particle of energy hbar.omega is actually a dissipative system maintained in a nonequilibrium steady state by a constant throughput of energy (heat flow), the exact Schroedinger equation is derived, both for conservative and nonconservative systems. Thereby, only universal properties of oscillators and nonequilibrium thermostatting are used, such that a maximal model independence of the hypothesised sub-quantum physics is guaranteed. It is claimed that this represents the shortest derivation of the Schroedinger equation from (modern) classical physics in the literature, and the only exact one, too. Moreover, a ""vacuum fluctuation theorem"" is presented, with particular emphasis on possible applications for a better understanding of quantum mechanical nonlocal effects.",Human
"Novel optical phenomena, including electromagnetically induced transparency, slow light, superluminal light propagation, have recently been demonstrated in diverse physical implementations. These phenomena are challenging to realize in practical systems because they require quantum coherence as well as careful preparation and control of prescribed quantum states. Here we present a unified approach to engineering optical materials that exhibit these phenomena by using mixtures of active and passive optical materials at frequencies near their resonances. Our approach does not depend on quantum coherence and can realize large and small (much less than 1) indices of refraction and negative permittivity ($\epsilon<0$), normal and anomalous dispersion, all while maintaining transparency.",Human
"We report the realization of a Pancharatnam-Berry phase optical element [Z. Bomzon, G. Biener, V. Kleiner, and E. Hasman, Opt. Lett. \textbf{27}, 1141 (2002)] for wavefront shaping working in the visible spectral domain, based on patterned liquid crystal technology. This device generates helical modes of visible light with the possibility of electro-optically switching between opposite helicities by controlling the handedness of the input circular polarization. By cascading this approach, fast switching among multiple wavefront helicities can be achieved, with potential applications to multi-state optical information encoding. The approach demonstrated here can be generalized to other polarization-controlled devices for wavefront shaping, such as switchable lenses, beam-splitters, and holographic elements.",Human
"Many body trial wave functions are the key ingredient for accurate Quantum Monte Carlo estimates of total electronic energies in many electron systems. In the Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo method, the accuracy of the trial function must be conjugated with the efficiency of its evaluation. We report recent progress in trial wave functions for metallic hydrogen implemented in the Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo method. We describe and characterize several types of trial functions of increasing complexity in the range of the coupling parameter $1.0 \leq r_s \leq1.55$. We report wave function comparisons for disordered protonic configurations and preliminary results for thermal averages.",Human
The phase diagram gadolinium fluoride - lutetium fluoride was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction analysis. Both pure components undergo a reversible first order transformation to a high temperature phase. The mutual solubility of both components is unlimited in the orthorhombic room temperature phase. The maximum solubility of Lu in the high temperature phase of GdF3 (tysonite type) is about 20% and the maximum solubility of Gd in LuF3 ($\alpha$-YF3 type) is about 40%. Intermediate compositions of the low temperature phase decompose upon heating in a peritectoid reaction to a mixture of both high temperature phases.,Human
"We study a family of opinion formation models in one dimension where the propensity for a voter to align with its local environment depends non-linearly on the fraction of disagreeing neighbors. Depending on this non-linearity in the voting rule, the population may exhibit a bias toward zero magnetization or toward consensus, and the average magnetization is generally not conserved. We use a decoupling approximation to truncate the equation hierarchy for multi-point spin correlations and thereby derive the probability to reach a final state of a given consensus as a function of the initial magnetization. The case when voters are influenced by more distant voters is also considered by investigating the Sznajd model.",Human
"After revisiting some high points of particle physics and QFT of the two decades from 1960 to 1980, I comment on the work by Jorge Andre Swieca. I explain how it fits into the quantum field theory during these two decades and draw attention to its relevance to the ongoing particle physics research. A particular aim of this article is to direct thr readers mindfulness to the relevance of what at the time of Swieca was called ""the Schwinger Higgs screening mechanism"". which, together with recent ideas which generalize the concept of gauge theories, has all the ingredients to revolutionize the issue of gauge theories and the standard model.",Human
"We calculate a pump current in a classical two-state stochastic chemical kinetics by means of the non-adiabatic geometrical phase interpretation. The two-state system is attached to two particle reservoirs, and under a periodic perturbation of the kinetic rates, it gives rise to a pump current between the two-state system and the absorbing states. In order to calculate the pump current, the Floquet theory for the non-adiabatic geometrical phase is extended from a Hermitian case to a non-Hermitian case. The dependence of the pump current on the frequency of the perturbative kinetic rates is explicitly derived, and a stochastic resonance-like behavior is obtained.",Human
"We present the results of our recent studies of a Thick Gaseous Electron Multiplier (THGEM)-based detector, operated in Ar, Xe and Ar:Xe (95:5) at various gas pressures. Avalanche-multiplication properties and energy resolution were investigated with soft x-rays for different detector configurations and parameters. Gains above 10E4 were reached in a double-THGEM detector, at atmospheric pressure, in all gases, in almost all the tested conditions; in Ar:Xe (95:5) similar gains were reached at pressures up to 2 bar. The energy resolution dependence on the gas, pressure, hole geometry and electric fields was studied in detail, yielding in some configurations values below 20% FWHM with 5.9 keV x-rays.",Human
"Silicon is an extremely attractive material platform for integrated optics at telecommunications wavelengths, particularly for integration with CMOS circuits. Developing detectors and electrically pumped lasers at telecom wavelengths are the two main technological hurdles before silicon can become a comprehensive platform for integrated optics. We report on the generation of free carriers in unimplanted SOI ridge waveguides, which we attribute to surface state absorption. By electrically contacting the waveguides, a photodetector with a responsivity of 36 mA/W and quantum efficiency of 2.8% is demonstrated. The photoconductive effect is shown to have minimal falloff at speeds of up to 60 Mhz.",Human
"Harmonic emission from cluster nanoplasmas subject to short intense infrared laser pulses is studied. In a previous publication [M. Kundu et al., Phys. Rev. A 76, 033201 (2007)] we reported particle-in-cell simulation results showing resonant enhancements of low-order harmonics when the Mie plasma frequency of the ionizing and expanding cluster resonates with the respective harmonic frequency. Simultaneously we found that high-order harmonics were barely present in the spectrum, even at high intensities. The current paper is focused on the analytical modeling of the process. We show that dynamical stochasticity owing to nonlinear resonance inhibits the emission of high order harmonics.",Human
"I compute from first principles the local heating rate $q$ (the amount of electromagnetic energy converted to heat per unit time per unit volume) for electromagnetic waves propagating in magnetically and electrically polarizable media. I find that, in magnetic media, this rate has two separate contributions, $q^{(V)}$ and $q^{(S)}$, the first coming from the volume of the medium and the second from its surface. I argue that the second law of thermodynamics requires that the volume contribution be positive and that this requirement, in turn, prohibits negative refraction. This result holds for active or passive media and in the presence of anisotropy and spatial dispersion.",Human
"In their textbook, Suzuki and Varga [Y. Suzuki and K. Varga, {\em Stochastic Variational Approach to Quantum-Mechanical Few-Body Problems} (Springer, Berlin, 1998)] present the stochastic variational method with the correlated Gaussian basis in a very exhaustive way. The matrix elements for central potentials are put under a pleasant form but the elements for spin dependent operators, when treated, are given as very cumbersome expressions. In this paper, we find a lot of new formulae for those elements. Their expressions are given in terms of the same geometrical functions that appear in the case of central potentials. These functions get therefore a universal status; this property is very useful for numerical applications.",Human
"We propose a method to reduce the computational effort to solve a partial differential equation on a given domain. The main idea is to split the domain of interest in two subdomains, and to use different approximation methods in each of the two subdomains. In particular, in one subdomain we discretize the governing equations by a canonical scheme, whereas in the other one we solve a reduced order model of the original problem. Different approaches to couple the low-order model to the usual discretization are presented. The effectiveness of these approaches is tested on numerical examples pertinent to non-linear model problems including the Laplace equation with non-linear boundary conditions and the compressible Euler equations.",Human
The quasi-channeling of positive and negative relativistic particles in a bent crystal is studied using the classical deflection function. It was shown that the potential scattering in a central field of bounded ring-like potentials may produce the ``reflected'' and ``refracted'' fractions of scattered particles. For particles with positive charge the ``reflected'' fraction is mainly presented; at the same time we predict that for particles with negative charge the ``refracted'' fraction should dominate. The effect of ``empty core'' for central scattering is also discussed. The average deflection angles for volume ``reflection'' and ``refraction'' are derived for accepted potential model of the crystal. The calculated average ``reflection'' angle is in satisfactory agreement with recent experimental data \cite{ivanov_2006},Human
"We present a review of the main aspects of geometrothermodynamics, an approach which allows us to associate a specific Riemannian structure to any classical thermodynamic system. In the space of equilibrium states, we consider a Legendre invariant metric, which is given in terms of the fundamental equation of the corresponding thermodynamic system, and analyze its geometric properties in the case of the van der Waals gas, and black holes. We conclude that the geometry of this particular metric reproduces the thermodynamic behavior of the van der Waals gas, and the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole, but it is not adequate for the thermodynamic description of Kerr black holes.",Human
"Using ultra-high-frequency data extracted from the order flows of 23 stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, we study the empirical regularities of order placement in the opening call auction, cool period and continuous auction. The distributions of relative logarithmic prices against reference prices in the three time periods are qualitatively the same with quantitative discrepancies. The order placement behavior is asymmetric between buyers and sellers and between the inside-the-book orders and outside-the-book orders. In addition, the conditional distributions of relative prices in the continuous auction are independent of the bid-ask spread and volatility. These findings are crucial to build an empirical behavioral microscopic model based on order flows for Chinese stocks.",Human
"A completely rigorous first-principles calculation of the charged particle stopping power has recently been performed by Brown, Preston, and Singleton (BPS). This calculation is exact to leading and next-to-leading order in the plasma number density, including an exact treatment of two-body quantum scattering. The BPS calculation is therefore extremely accurate in the plasma regime realized during the ignition and burn of an inertial confinement fusion capsule. For deuterium-tritium fusion, the 3.5 MeV alpha particle range tends to be 20-30% longer than most models in the literature have predicted, and the energy deposition into the ions tends to be smaller. Preliminary numerical simulations indicate that this increases the rho-R required to achieve ignition.",Human
"We report Monte Carlo simulations of critical dynamics far from equilibrium on a perfect and non-perfect surface in the 3d Ising model. For an ordered initial state, the dynamic relaxation of the surface magnetization, the line magnetization of the defect line, and the corresponding susceptibilities and appropriate cumulant is carefully examined at the ordinary, special and surface phase transitions. The universal dynamic scaling behavior including a dynamic crossover scaling form is identified. The exponent $\beta_1$ of the surface magnetization and $\beta_2$ of the line magnetization are extracted. The impact of the defect line on the surface universality classes is investigated.",Human
"Modern societies feature an increasing contact between cultures, yet we have a poor understanding of what the outcomes might be. Here we consider a mathematical model of contact between social groups, grounded in social psychology and analyzed using tools from statistical physics. We use the model to study how a culture might be affected by immigration. We find that in some cases residents' culture is relatively unchanged, but in other cases residents may adopt the opinions and beliefs of immigrants. The decisive factors are each group's cultural legacy and its attitudes towards in- and out-groups. The model can also predict how social policies may influence the outcome of culture contact.",Human
"Soft-constraint affinity propagation (SCAP) is a new statistical-physics based clustering technique. First we give the derivation of a simplified version of the algorithm and discuss possibilities of time- and memory-efficient implementations. Later we give a detailed analysis of the performance of SCAP on artificial data, showing that the algorithm efficiently unveils clustered and hierarchical data structures. We generalize the algorithm to the problem of semi-supervised clustering, where data are already partially labeled, and clustering assigns labels to previously unlabeled points. SCAP uses both the geometrical organization of the data and the available labels assigned to few points in a computationally efficient way, as is shown on artificial and biological benchmark data.",Human
"Controlled generation and manipulation of photon states encoded in their spatial degrees of freedom is a crucial ingredient in many quantum information tasks exploiting higher-than-two dimensional encoding. Here, we prove the impossibility to arbitrarily modify $d$-level state superpositions (qu$d$its) for $d>2$, encoded in the transverse modes of light, with optical components associated to the group of symplectic transforms (Gaussian operations). Surprisingly, we also provide an explicit construction of how non-Gaussian operations acting on mode subspaces do enable to overcome the limit $d=2$. In addition, this set of operations realizes the full SU(3) algebra.",Human
We compute the spin-independent structure functions of the forward virtual-photon Compton tensor of the proton at one loop using heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory and dispersion relations. We study the relation between both approaches. We use these results to generalize some sum rules to virtual photon transfer momentum and relate them with sum rules in deep inelastic scattering. We then compute the leading chiral term of the polarizability correction to the Lamb shift of the hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. We obtain -87.05/n^3 Hz and -0.148/n^3 meV for the correction to the hydrogen and muonic hydrogen Lamb shift respectively.,Human
"Population stratification is a problem encountered in several areas of biology and public health. We tackle this problem by mapping a population and its elements attributes into a hypergraph, a natural extension of the concept of graph or network to encode associations among any number of elements. On this hypergraph, we construct a statistical model reflecting our intuition about how the elements attributes can emerge from a postulated population structure. Finally, we introduce the concept of stratification representativeness as a mean to identify the simplest stratification already containing most of the information about the population structure. We demonstrate the power of this framework stratifying an animal and a human population based on phenotypic and genotypic properties, respectively.",Human
"Throughout the history of the study of turbulence in fluid dynamics, there has yet to arise a unique definition or theoretical criterion for this important phenomenon. There have been interesting conjectures made by Ruelle [2], Muriel [3], and Getreuer, Albano and Muriel [6], however, attempting to provide the sufficient criteria for the onset of turbulence. In this paper, a classic equation in fluid dynamics, Burger's equation, is solved in one and two dimensions, and these conjectures are illustrated. This illustration supports these conjectures by showing that the proposed criteria do arise mathematically from the solutions of an equation modelling fluid flows.",Human
"We present an inexpensive apparatus for measuring the speed of sound, with a time of flight method, using a computer with a stereo sound board. Students measure the speed of sound by timing the delay between the arrivals of a pulse to two microphones placed at different distances from the source. It can serve as a very effective demonstration, providing a quick measurement of the speed of sound in air; we have used it with great success in Open Days in our Department. It can also be used for a full fledged laboratory determination of the speed of sound in air.",Human
"Uncoordinated individuals in human society pursuing their personally optimal strategies do not always achieve the social optimum, the most beneficial state to the society as a whole. Instead, strategies form Nash equilibria which are often socially suboptimal. Society, therefore, has to pay a price of anarchy for the lack of coordination among its members. Here we assess this price of anarchy by analyzing the travel times in road networks of several major cities. Our simulation shows that uncoordinated drivers possibly waste a considerable amount of their travel time. Counterintuitively,simply blocking certain streets can partially improve the traffic conditions. We analyze various complex networks and discuss the possibility of similar paradoxes in physics.",Human
"We introduce a new class of deterministic networks by associating networks with Diophantine equations, thus relating network topology to algebraic properties. The network is formed by representing integers as vertices and by drawing cliques between M vertices every time that M distinct integers satisfy the equation. We analyse the network generated by the Pythagorean equation $x^{2}+y^{2}= z^{2}$ showing that its degree distribution is well approximated by a power law with exponential cut-off. We also show that the properties of this network differ considerably from the features of scale-free networks generated through preferential attachment. Remarkably we also recover a power law for the clustering coefficient.",Human
"We present up to 24-photon Bragg diffraction as a beam splitter in light-pulse atom interferometers to achieve the largest splitting in momentum space so far. Relative to the 2-photon processes used in the most sensitive present interferometers, these large momentum transfer beam splitters increase the phase shift 12-fold for Mach-Zehnder (MZ-) and 144-fold for Ramsey-Borde (RB-) geometries. We achieve a high visibility of the interference fringes (up to 52% for MZ or 36% for RB) and long pulse separation times that are possible only in atomic fountain setups. As the atom's internal state is not changed, important systematic effects can cancel.",Human
"We investigate the influence of a uniform magnetic field ${\bf B_0}=B_0 e//$ on energy decay laws in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. The nonlinear transfer reduction along $B_0$ is included in a model that distinguishes parallel and perpendicular directions, following a phenomenology {\it \`a la} Kraichnan. We predict a slowing down of the energy decay due to anisotropy in the limit of strong $B_0$, with distinct power laws for energy decay of shear- and pseudo-Alfv\'en waves. Numerical results from the kinetic equations of Alfv\'en wave turbulence recover these predictions, and MHD numerical results clearly tend to follow them in the lowest perpendicular planes.",Human
We develop a qualitative geometric approach to swimming at low Reynolds number which avoids solving differential equations and uses instead landscape figures of two notions of curvatures: The swimming curvature and the curvature derived from dissipation. This approach gives complete information for swimmers that swim on a line without rotations and gives the main qualitative features for general swimmers that can also rotate. We illustrate this approach for a symmetric version of Purcell's swimmer which we solve by elementary analytical means within slender body theory. We then apply the theory to derive the basic qualitative properties of Purcell's swimmer.,Human
"We construct simple analytic models of the $S$-matrix, accounting for both scattering resonances and smooth background contributions for collisions that occur below the s-wave threshold. Such models are important for studying confinement-induced resonances such as those occurring in cold collisions of $^{133}$Cs atoms in separated sites of a polarization-gradient optical lattice. Because these resonances occur at negative energy with respect to the s-wave threshold, they cannot be studied easily using direct numerical solutions of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation. Using our analytic model, we extend previous studies of negative-energy scattering to the multichannel case, accounting for the interplay of Feshbach resonances, large background scattering lengths, and inelastic processes.",Human
"Particle models for streamer ionization fronts contain correct electron energy distributions, runaway effects and single electron statistics. Conventional fluid models are computationally much more efficient for large particle numbers, but create too low ionization densities in high fields. To combine their respective advantages, we here show how to couple both models in space. We confirm that the discrepancies between particle and fluid fronts arise from the steep electron density gradients in the leading edge of the fronts. We find the optimal position for the interface between models that minimizes computational effort and reproduces the results of a pure particle model.",Human
"CREME96 and GEANT4 are two well known particle transport codes through matter in space science. We present a comparison between the proton fluxes outgoing from an aluminium target, obtained by using both tools. The primary proton flux is obtained by CREME96 only, covering an energy range from MeV to hundreds GeV with the same result in both cases. We studied different thickness targets and two different GEANT4 physics lists in order to show how the spectra of the outgoing proton fluxes are modified. Our findings show consistent agreement of simulation data by each tool, with regards both GEANT4 physics lists and every thickness target analysed.",Human
"The basic principles of detection of fast neutrons with liquid scintillator detectors are reviewed, together with a real example in the form of the Neutron Wall array. Two of the challenges in neutron detection, discrimination of neutrons and gamma rays and identification of cross talk between detectors due to neutron scattering, are briefly discussed, as well as possible solutions to these problems. The possibilities of using digital techniques for pulse-shape discrimination are examined. Results from a digital and analog versions of the zero cross-over algorithm are presented. The digital pulse-shape discrimination is shown to give, at least, as good results as the corresponding analogue version.",Human
"We have developed prototypes of GEM-like detectors with resistive electrodes to be used as RICH photodetectors equipped with CsI photocathodes. The main advantages of these detectors are their intrinsic spark protection and possibility to operate at high gain (~10E5) in many gases including poorly quenched ones, allowing for the adoption of windowless configurations in which the radiator gas is also used in the chamber. Results of systematic studies of the resistive GEMs combined with CsI photocathodes are presented: its quantum efficiency, rate characteristics, long-term stability, etc. On the basis of the obtained results, we believe that the new detector will be a promising candidate for upgrading the ALICE RICH detector",Human
"When a very thin capillary is inserted into a liquid, the liquid is sucked into it: this imbibition process is controlled by a balance of capillary and drag forces, which are hard to quantify experimentally, in particularly considering flow on the nanoscale. By computer experiments using a generic coarse-grained model, it is shown that an analysis of imbibition forced by a controllable external pressure quantifies relevant physical parameter such as the Laplace pressure, Darcy's permeability, effective pore radius, effective viscosity, dynamic contact angle and slip length of the fluid flowing into the pore. In determining all these parameters independently, the consistency of our analysis of such forced imbibition processes is demonstrated.",Human
"The radiation damage of the positron source target for the International Linear Collider (ILC) has been studied. The displacement damage in target material due to multi-MeV photons has been calculated by combining FLUKA simulations for secondary particle production, SPECTER data for neutron displacement cross-sections and the Lindhard model for estimations of displacement damage by ions. The radiation damage of a stationary Ti6Al4V target in units of displacements per atom (dpa) has been estimated for photons from an undulator with strength 0.92 and period 1.15 cm. The calculated damage is 7 dpa. Approximately 12.5% of displacement damage result from neutrons.",Human

"The effect of conducting pipes on the equilibrium of intense nonaxisymmetric continuous beams of charged particles is investigated. For a cylindrical pipe and an elliptical beam, we obtain an exact closed form analytical expression for the electrostatic potential. Using a variational principle, we then explore the distortions that equilibrium beams suffer due to the conducting channel. Finally, we present an exact proof that despite the nonlinear forces acting on beams of arbitrary cross section inside conducting pipes of arbitrary shape, the density of these beams remains homogeneous and their cross sectional area remains the sa me as the one in free-space.",Human
"A new single-time two-point closure is proposed, in which the equation for the two-point correlation between the displacement of a fluid particle and the velocity allows one to estimate a Lagrangian timescale. This timescale is used to specify the nonlinear damping of triple correlations in the closure. A closed set of equations is obtained without ad hoc constants. Taking advantage of the analogy between particle displacements and scalar fluctuations in isotropic turbulence subjected to a mean scalar gradient, the model is numerically integrated. Results for the energy spectrum are in agreement with classical scaling predictions. An estimate for the Kolmogorov constant is obtained.",Human
"We present results on simulations of a stock market with heterogeneous, cumulative information setup. We find a non-monotonic behaviour of traders' returns as a function of their information level. Particularly, the average informed agents underperform random traders; only the most informed agents are able to beat the market. We also study the effect of a strategy updating mechanism, when traders have the possibility of using other pieces of information than the fundamental value. These results corroborate the latter ones: it is only for the most informed player that it is rewarding to stay fundamentalist. The simulations reproduce some stylized facts of tick-by-tick stock-exchange data and globally show informational efficiency.",Human
"A testbed for wireless vehicle communication based on a microscopic model in the framework of three-phase traffic theory is presented. In this testbed, vehicle motion in traffic flow and analyses of a vehicle communication channel access based on IEEE 802.11e mechanisms, radio propagation modeling, message reception characteristics as well as all other effects associated with ad-hoc networks are integrated into a three-phase traffic flow model. Based on simulations of this testbed, some statistical features of ad-hoc vehicle networks as well as the effect of C2C communication on increase in the efficiency and safety of traffic are studied.",Human
"We experimentally study the turbulent flow between two coaxial and independently rotating cylinders. We determined the scaling of the torque with Reynolds numbers at various angular velocity ratios (Rotation numbers), and the behaviour of the wall shear stress when varying the Rotation number at high Reynolds numbers. We compare the curves with PIV analysis of the mean flow and show the peculiar role of perfect counterrotation for the emergence of organised large scale structures in the mean part of this very turbulent flow that appear in a smooth and continuous way: the transition resembles a supercritical bifurcation of the secondary mean flow.",Human
"We use coordinate transformation theory to realize substrates that can modify the emission of an embedded source. Simulation results show that with proper transformation functions the energy radiated by a source embedded in these space variant media will be concentrated in a narrow beam. The thickness of the slab achieved with our transformations will no longer be restricted by the evanescent modes and the source can be placed at any position along the boundary of the substrate without affecting the radiation pattern. We also discuss the case where reduced parameters are used, which still performs well and is physically realizable.",Human
"We investigate the use of Kelly's strategy in the construction of an optimal portfolio of assets. For lognormally distributed asset returns, we derive approximate analytical results for the optimal investment fractions in various settings. We show that when mean returns and volatilities of the assets are small and there is no risk-free asset, the Kelly-optimal portfolio lies on Markowitz Efficient Frontier. Since in the investigated case the Kelly approach forbids short positions and borrowing, often only a small fraction of the available assets is included in the Kelly-optimal portfolio. This phenomenon, that we call condensation, is studied analytically in various model scenarios.",Human
"We probe the dynamic strength of multiple biotin-streptavidin adhesion bonds under linear loading using the biomembrane force probe setup for dynamic force spectroscopy. Measured rupture force histograms are compared to results from a master equation model for the stochastic dynamics of bond rupture under load. This allows us to extract the distribution of the number of initially closed bonds. We also extract the molecular parameters of the adhesion bonds, in good agreement with earlier results from single bond experiments. Our analysis shows that the peaks in the measured histograms are not simple multiples of the single bond values, but follow from a superposition procedure which generates different peak positions.",Human
"Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) have recently been recognized as an important future technique for microelectronics. Such SPPs have been studied using classical theory. However, current state-of-the-art experiments are rapidly approaching nanoscales, and quantum effects can then become important. Here we study the properties of quantum SPPs at the interface between an electron quantum plasma and a dielectric material. It is shown that the effect of quantum broadening of the transition layer is most important. In particular, the damping of SPPs does not vanish even in the absence of collisional dissipation, thus posing a fundamental size limit for plasmonic devices. Consequences and applications of our results are pointed out.",Human
"Dust particles often form vertical chains due to the influence of the wakefield produced by the streaming ions in the plasma sheath. These particle chains are proving useful as a unique diagnostic tool for investigating the physics behind the basic properties of the ion wakefield within the plasma sheath. In this paper, an experimental method is presented for investigating the ion wakefield which employs a new oscillation technique designed to perturb a two-particle vertical chain. Using this technique, damped free fall oscillations are generated via an external DC bias to the lower electrode. A fast Fourier transformation is then used to produce a spectrum from the collected oscillation data and a center of mass oscillation is identified.",Human
"Experimental program review in our field may benefit from a more quantitative framework within which to quantitatively discuss the scientific merit of a proposed program of research, and to assess the scientific merit of a particular experimental result. This article proposes explicitly such a quantitative framework. Examples of the use of this framework in assessing the scientific merit of particular avenues of research at the energy frontier in many cases provide results in stark contradiction to accepted wisdom. The experimental scientific figure of merit proposed here has the potential for informing future choices of research direction in our field, and in other subfields of the physical sciences.",Human
"Based on high-order harmonic generation (HHG) spectra obtained from solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for atoms, we established quantitatively that the HHG yield can be expressed as the product of a returning electron wave packet and the photo-recombination cross sections, and the shape of the returning wave packet is shown to be largely independent of the species. By comparing the HHG spectra generated from different targets under identical laser pulses, accurate structural information, including the phase of the recombination amplitude, can be retrieved. This result opens up the possibility of studying the target structure of complex systems, including their time evolution, from the HHG spectra generated by short laser pulses.",Human
"On the micro- and nanoscale, classical hydrodynamic boundary conditions such as the no-slip condition no longer apply. Instead, the flow profiles exhibit ``slip`` at the surface, which is characterized by a finite slip length (partial slip). We present a new, systematic way of implementing partial-slip boundary conditions with arbitrary slip length in coarse-grained computer simulations. The main idea is to represent the complex microscopic interface structure by a spatially varying effective viscous force. An analytical equation for the resulting slip length can be derived for planar and for curved surfaces. The comparison with computer simulations of a DPD (dissipative particle dynamics) fluid shows that this expression is valid from full-slip to no-slip.",Human
"To characterise (inter)diffusion in materials, concentration profiles can be measured by EDX. It allows one to determine the chemical composition with a very good accuracy if measurement artefacts are accounted for. Standard phenomena (such as X-ray fluorescence) are usually corrected by commercial software. However, the effect of the pear-shaped volume of X-ray emission on the concentration profiles has to be considered. The paper describes the origin of this artefact, its consequences on measurements and will provide a practical solution (based on signal processing methods) to deconvolute the actual concentration profiles (or the diffusion coefficient) from the raw measurements.",Human
"Functionalization of carbon nanotubes with hydrosoluble porphyrins (TPPS) is achieved by ""$\pi$-stacking"". The porphyrin/nanotube interaction is studied by means of optical absorption, photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopies. The main absorption line of the porphyrins adsorbed on nanotubes exhibits a 120 meV red shift, which we ascribe to a flattening of the molecule in order to optimize $\pi-\pi$ interactions. The porphyrin-nanotube complex shows a strong quenching of the TPPS emission while the photoluminescence intensity of the nanotubes is enhanced when the excitation laser is in resonance with the porphyrin absorption band. This reveals an efficient excitation transfer from the TPPS to the carbon nanotube.",Human
"Recently, a method to image molecular electronic wave functions using high harmonic generation (HHG) was introduced by Itatani \textit{et al.\} [Nature {\textbf{432}}, 876 (2004)]. We show that, while the tomographic reconstruction of general orbitals with arbitrary symmetry cannot be performed with long laser pulses, this becomes possible when extremely short pulses are used. An alternative reconstruction equation based on momentum matrix elements, rather than on dipole matrix elements, is proposed. We present simulations of the procedure for 2D model systems based on numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation, and present results from further post-processing of the reconstructed orbitals.",Human
"We show that nuclear motion of Rydberg atoms can be induced by resonant dipole-dipole interactions that trigger the energy transfer between two energetically close Rydberg states. How and if the atoms move depends on their initial arrangement as well as on the initial electronic excitation. Using a mixed quantum/classical propagation scheme we obtain the trajectories and kinetic energies of atoms, initially arranged in a regular chain and prepared in excitonic eigenstates. The influence of off-diagonal disorder on the motion of the atoms is examined and it is shown that irregularity in the arrangement of the atoms can lead to an acceleration of the nuclear dynamics.",Human
"Surface plasmon-polaritons have recently attracted renewed interest in the scientific community for their potential in sub-wavelength optics, light generation and non-destructive sensing. Given that they cannot be directly excited by freely propagating light due to their intrinsical binding to the metal surface, the light-plasmon coupling efficiency becomes of crucial importance for the success of any plasmonic device. Here we present a comprehensive study on the modulation (enhancement or suppression) of such coupling efficiency by means of one-dimensional surface corrugation. Our approach is based on simple wave interference and enables us to make quantitative predictions which have been experimentally confirmed at both the near infra-red and telecom ranges.",Human
"When one deals with data drawn from continuous variables, a histogram is often inadequate to display their probability density. It deals inefficiently with statistical noise, and binsizes are free parameters. In contrast to that, the empirical cumulative distribution function (obtained after sorting the data) is parameter free. But it is a step function, so that its differentiation does not give a smooth probability density. Based on Fourier series expansion and Kolmogorov tests, we introduce a simple method, which overcomes this problem. Error bars on the estimated probability density are calculated using a jackknife method. We give several examples and provide computer code reproducing them. You may want to look at the corresponding figures 4 to 9 first.",Human
"Influence of quantum effects on the internal waves and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in plasma is investigated. It is shown that quantum pressure always stabilizes the RT instability. The problem is solved both in the limit of short-wavelength perturbations and exactly for density profiles with layers of exponential stratification. In the case of stable stratification, quantum pressure modifies the dispersion relation of the inertial waves. Because of the quantum effects, the internal waves may propagate in the transverse direction, which was impossible in the classical case. A specific form of pure quantum internal waves is obtained, which do not require any external gravitational field.",Human
"Tabrizi et al. [physics/0701342] discuss the feasibility of an electron-based crystal undulator (e-CU) by planar channeling of 50 GeV electrons through a periodically bent crystal. We show that their scheme is not feasible. First, their undulator parameter is K >> 1 always, which destroys photon interference. Second, they overestimate the electron dechanneling length in e-CU by an order of magnitude, which shortens the number N of e-CU periods from 5-15 (as they hope) to just 1-2. This kills their e-CU concept again. We made first simulation of electron channeling in undulated crystal and conclude that an electron-based crystal wiggler is feasible with wiggler strength K=10 and number of periods N=2.",Human
"The empirical study of network dynamics has been limited by the lack of longitudinal data. Here we introduce a quantitative indicator of link persistence to explore the correlations between the structure of a mobile phone network and the persistence of its links. We show that persistent links tend to be reciprocal and are more common for people with low degree and high clustering. We study the redundancy of the associations between persistence, degree, clustering and reciprocity and show that reciprocity is the strongest predictor of tie persistence. The method presented can be easily adapted to characterize the dynamics of other networks and can be used to identify the links that are most likely to survive in the future.",Human
"A toy detector has been designed to simulate central detectors in reactor neutrino experiments in the paper. The electron samples from the Monte-Carlo simulation of the toy detector have been reconstructed by the method of Bayesian neural networks (BNN) and the standard algorithm, a maximum likelihood method (MLD), respectively. The result of the event reconstruction using BNN has been compared with the one using MLD. Compared to MLD, the uncertainties of the electron vertex are not improved, but the energy resolutions are significantly improved using BNN. And the improvement is more obvious for the high energy electrons than the low energy ones.",Human
"We derive the equations for the gravity assist manoeuvre in the general 2D case without the constraints of circular planetary orbits or widely different masses as assumed by Broucke, and obtain the slingshot conditions and maximum energy gain for arbitrary mass ratios of two colliding rigid bodies. Using the geometric view developed in an earlier paper by the authors the possible trajectories are computed for both attractive or repulsive interactions yielding a further insight on the slingshot mechanics and its parametrization. The general slingshot manoeuvre for arbitrary masses is explained as a particular case of the possible outcomes of attractive or repulsive binary collisions, and the correlation between asymptotic information and orbital parameters is obtained in general.",Human
"We demonstrate an all-optical bump-on-tail instability by considering the nonlinear interaction of two partially-coherent spatial beams. For weak wave coupling, we observe momentum transfer with no variation in intensity. For strong wave coupling, modulations appear in intensity and evidence appears for wave (Langmuir) collapse at large scales. Borrowing plasma language, these limits represent regimes of weak and strong spatial optical turbulence. In both limits, the internal spectral energy redistribution is observed by recording and reconstructing a hologram of the evolving dynamics. The results are universal and can appear in any wave-kinetic system with short-wave/long-wave coupling.",Human
"Despite its importance, the understanding of ionic cloud distribution close to a charged macroion under physiological salt conditions has remained very limited especially for strongly coupled systems with, for instance, multivalent counterions. Here we present a formalism that predicts both counterion and coion distributions in the vicinity of a charged macroion for an arbitrary amount of added salt and in both limits of mean field and strong coupling. The distribution functions are calculated explicitly for ions next to an infinite planar charged wall. We present a schematic phase diagram identifying different physical regimes in terms of electrostatic coupling parameter and bulk salt concentration.",Human
"Many difficult computational problems involve the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple constraints which are individually easy to satisfy. Such problems occur in diffractive imaging, protein folding, constrained optimization (e.g., spin glasses), and satisfiability testing. We present a simple geometric framework to express and solve such problems and apply it to two benchmarks. In the first application (3SAT, a boolean satisfaction problem), the resulting method exhibits similar performance scaling as a leading context-specific algorithm (walksat). In the second application (sphere packing), the method allowed us to find improved solutions to some old and well-studied optimization problems. Based upon its simplicity and observed efficiency, we argue that this framework provides a competitive alternative to stochastic methods such as simulated annealing.",Human
"Electromagnetic field propagation through a transition layer between the positive-index and negative-index materials with linearly changing dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability was investigated. It is shown that at oblique incidence, the components of both TE- and TM-waves exhibit singular behavior in the vicinity of the point where both dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability are equal to zero. In this case, finite dissipation of electromagnetic field energy takes place even at infinitesimally small values of losses. These results are applicable to a broader class of inhomogeneous metamaterials and may provide a new platform for the realization of low intensity nonlinear optics in metamaterials.",Human
"We consider words as a network of interacting letters, and approximate the probability distribution of states taken on by this network. Despite the intuition that the rules of English spelling are highly combinatorial (and arbitrary), we find that maximum entropy models consistent with pairwise correlations among letters provide a surprisingly good approximation to the full statistics of four letter words, capturing ~92% of the multi-information among letters and even ""discovering"" real words that were not represented in the data from which the pairwise correlations were estimated. The maximum entropy model defines an energy landscape on the space of possible words, and local minima in this landscape account for nearly two-thirds of words used in written English.",Human
"The equations governing a collisionless obliquely-flowing plasma around an ion-absorbing object in a strong magnetic field are shown to have an exact analytic solution even for arbitrary (two-dimensional) object-shape, when temperature is uniform, and diffusive transport can be ignored. The solution has an extremely simple geometric embodiment. It shows that the ion collection flux density to a convex body's surface depends only upon the orientation of the surface, and provides the theoretical justification and calibration of oblique `Mach-probes'. The exponential form of this exact solution helps explain the approximate fit of this function to previous numerical solutions.",Human
"The loop quantum theory, which constitutes a very small discontinuous space, as new method is applied to biology. The model of protein folding and lungs is proposed. In the model, some known results are used, and four approximate conclusions are obtained: their structures are quantized, their space regions are finite, various singularities correspond to folding and crossed points, and different types of catastrophe exist. Further, based on the inseparability and correlativity of the biological systems, the nonlinear whole biology is proposed, and four basic hypotheses are formed. It may unify reductionism and holism, structuralism and functionalism. Finally, the medical meaning of the theory is discussed briefly.",Human
"The resonant generation of relativistic plasma waves and plasma wave guiding by two co-propagating laser pulses has been studied. By proper timing between guiding and driver pulses, a resonant interaction occurs, which generates a high-amplitude plasma wave over a longer length than is possible with either of the laser pulses individually. The growth of the plasma wave is inferred by the measurement of monoenergetic electron beams with low divergence that are not measured by using either of the pulses individually. This scheme can be easily implemented, and allows more control of the interaction than is available to the single pulse scheme.",Human
"A 1-D linear gyrokinetic code called AWECS is developed to study the kinetic excitation of Alfvenic instabilities in a high-beta tokamak plasma, with beta being the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure. It is designed to describe physics associated with a broad range of frequencies and wavelengths. For example, AWECS is capable of simulating kinetic ballooning modes, Alfvenic ion-temperature-gradient-driven modes, as well as Alfven instabilities due to energetic particles. In addition, AWECS may be used to study drift-Alfven instabilities in the low-beta regime. Here, the layout of the code and the numerical methods used are described. AWECS is benchmarked against other codes and a convergence study is carried out.",Human
"We experimentally investigate the effect of atomic $\delta$-kicked rotor potentials on the mutual coherence between wavepackets in an atom interferometer. The differential action of the kicked rotor degrades the mutual coherence, leading to a reduction of the interferometry fringe visibility; however, when the repetition rate of the kicked rotor is at or near the quantum resonance, we observe revival of matter-wave coherence as the number of kicks increases, resulting in non-vanishing coherence in the large kick number limit. This coherence saturation effect reflects a saturation of fidelity decay due to momentum displacements in deep quantum regime. The saturation effect is accompanied with an invariant distribution of matter-wave coherence under the kicked rotor perturbations.",Human
"The surface roughness of a recently exhumed strikeslip fault plane has been measured by three independent 3D portable laser scanners. Digital elevation models of several fault surface areas, from 1 m2 to 600 m2, have been measured at a resolution ranging from 5 mm to 80 mm. Out of plane height fluctuations are described by non-Gaussian distribution with exponential long range tails. Statistical scaling analyses show that the striated fault surface exhibits self-affine scaling invariance with a small but significant directional morphological anisotropy that can be described by two scaling roughness exponents, H1 = 0.7 in the direction of slip and H2 = 0.8 perpendicular to the direction of slip.",Human
"Stylolites are spectacular rough dissolution surfaces that are found in many rock types. Despite many studies, their genesis is still debated, particularly the time scales of their formation and the relationship between this time and their morphology. We developed a new discrete simulation technique to explore the dynamic growth of the stylolite roughness, starting from an initially flat dissolution surface. We demonstrate that the typical steep stylolite teeth geometry can accurately be modelled and reproduce natural patterns. The growth of the roughness takes place in two successive time regimes: i) an initial non-linear increase in roughness amplitude that follows a power-law in time up to ii) a critical time where the roughness amplitude saturates and stays constant.",Human
"We present a method to distinguish the high harmonics generated in individual half-cycle of the driving laser pulse by mixing a weak ultraviolet pulse, enabling one to observe the cutoff of each half-cycle harmonic. We show that the detail information of the driving laser pulse, including the laser intensity, pulse duration and carrier-envelope phase, can be {\it in situ} retrieved from the harmonic spectrogram. In addition, our results show that this method also distinguishes the half-cycle high harmonics for a pulse longer than 10 fs, suggesting a potential to extend the CEP measurement to the multi-cycle regime.",Human
"We present a scheme for implementing quantum operations with superconducting qubits. Our approach uses a ""coupler"" qubit to mediate a controllable, secular interaction between ""data"" qubits, pulse sequences which strongly mitigate the effects of 1/f flux noise, and a high-Q resonator-based local memory. We develop a Monte-Carlo simulation technique capable of describing arbitrary noise-induced dephasing and decay, and demonstrate in this system a set of universal gate operations with O(10^-5) error probabilities in the presence of experimentally measured levels of 1/f noise. We then add relaxation and quantify the decay times required to maintain this error level.",Human
An acoustic field is used to increase the critical heat flux (CHF) of a flat-boiling-heat-transfer surface. The increase is a result of the acoustic effects on the vapor bubbles. Experiments are performed to explore the effects of an acoustic field on vapor bubbles in the vicinity of a rigid-heated wall. Work includes the construction of a novel heater used to produce a single vapor bubble of a prescribed size and at a prescribed location on a flatboiling surface for better study of an individual vapor bubble's reaction to the acoustic field. Work also includes application of the results from the single-bubble heater to a calibrated-copper heater used for quantifying the improvements in CHF.,Human
"We perform rescaled range analysis upon the signals measured by Dual Particle Dynamical Analyzer in gas-liquid two-phase turbulent jets. A novel rescaled range analysis is proposed to investigate these unevenly sampled signals. The Hurst exponents of velocity and other passive scalars in the bulk of spray are obtained to be 0.59$\pm $0.02 and the fractal dimension is hence 1.41$\pm $ 0.02, which are in remarkable agreement with and much more precise than previous results. These scaling exponents are found to be independent of the configuration and dimensions of the nozzle and the fluid flows. Therefore, such type of systems form a universality class with invariant scaling properties.",Human
"We present a simple, two dimensional example of a ""cat"" -- a body with zero angular momentum that can rotate itself with no external forces. This model is used to explain why this problem is known to be a gauge theory and to illustrate the importance of non-commutative operators. We will also show a comparison between the free-space ""cat"" in Newtonian mechanics and the same problem in Aristotelian mechanics at low Reynolds number; this simple example shows the analogy between (angular) momentum in Newtonian mechanics and (torque) force in Aristotelian mechanics. We will end by pointing out a topological invariant common to our model in free space and at low Reynolds number.",Human
Equilibrium aspects of molecular recognition of rigid biomolecules are investigated using coarse-grained lattice models. The analysis is carried out in two stages. First an ensemble of probe molecules is designed with respect to the target biomolecule. The recognition ability of the probe ensemble is then investigated by calculating the free energy of association. The influence of cooperative and anti-cooperative effects accompanying the association of the target and probe molecules is studied. Numerical findings are presented and compared to analytical results which can be obtained in the limit of dominating cooperativity and in the mean-field formulation of the models.,Human
"In this investigation, the numerical simulation of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) ion-drag micropumps with micropillar electrode geometries have been performed. The effect of micropillar height and electrode spacing on the performance of the micropumps was investigated. The performance of the EHD micropump improved with increased applied voltage and decreased electrode spacing. The optimum micropillar height for the micropump with electrode spacing of 40$\mu$m and channel height of 100$\mu$m at 200V was 40$\mu$m, where a maximum mass flow rate of 0.18g/min was predicted. Compared to that of planar electrodes, the 3D micropillar electrode geometry enhanced the overall performance of the EHD micropumps.",Human
"This paper analyzes a transient method for the characterization of low-resistance thermal interfaces of microelectronic packages. The transient method can yield additional information about the package not available with traditional static methods at the cost of greater numerical complexity, hardware requirements, and sensitivity to noise. While the method is established for package-level thermal analysis of mounted and assembled parts, its ability to measure the relatively minor thermal impedance of thin thermal interface material (TIM) layers has not yet been fully studied. We combine the transient thermal test with displacement measurements of the bond line thickness to fully characterize the interface.",Human
"We demonstrate the capabilities of a high temperature measurement set-up recently developed at our institute. It is dedicated to the characterization of semiconductor devices and test structures in the temperature range from room temperature up to 500 degrees C and higher. A detailed description of the experimental aquipment is given. Its practical use is demonstrated by measuring temperature-dependent charcteristics of silicon VDMOSFET and IGBT devices as well as SiC-diodes. For the silicon devices, numerical simulations based on recently developed high temperature physical models were also performed in order to gain a deeper understanding of the measured data, together with a revalidation of the model parameters.",Human
"A flat mounting unit with electronically variable thermal resistance [1] has been presented in the last year [2]. The design was based on a Peltier cell and the appropriate control electronics and software. The device is devoted especially to the thermal characterization of packages, e.g. in dual cold plate arrangements. Although this design meets the requirements of the static measurement we are intended to improve its parameters as the settling time and dynamic thermal impedance and the range of realized thermal resistance. The new design applies the heat flux sensor developed by our team as well [3], making easier the control of the device. This development allows even the realization of negative thermal resistances.",Human
"The flexible profile approach proposed earlier to create CTM (compact or reduced order thermal models) is extended to cover the area of conjugate heat transfer. The flexible profile approach is a methodology that allows building a highly boundary conditions independent CTM, with any desired degree of accuracy, that may adequately replace detailed 3D models for the whole spectrum of applications in which the modeled object may be used. The extension to conjugate problems radically solves the problem of interfacing two different domains. Each domain, fluid or solid, can be ""compacted"" independently creating two CTM that can be joined together to produce reliable results for any arbitrary set of external boundary conditions.",Human
"A thermal position sensor was fabricated and evaluated. The device consists of an array of temperature sensing elements, fabricated entirely on a plastic substrate. A novel fabrication technology was implemented which allows direct integration with read out electronics and communication to the macro-world without the use of wire bonding. The fabricated sensing elements are temperature sensitive Pt resistors with an average TCR of 0.0024/C. The device realizes the detection of the position and the motion of a heating source by monitoring the resistance variation of the thermistor array. The application field of such a cost-effective position sensor is considered quite extensive.",Human
"From a scale analysis of hydrodynamic phenomena having a significant action on the drift of an object in coastal ocean waters, we deduce equations modeling the associated hydrodynamic fields over a time period of several weeks. These models are essentially non linear hyperbolic systems of PDE involving a small parameter. Then from the models we extract a simplified and nevertheless typical one for which we prove that its classical solution exists on a time interval which is independent of the small parameter. We then show that the solution weak-* converges as the small parameter goes to zero and we characterize the equation satisfied by the weak-* limit",Human
"A measurement using a one-electron quantum cyclotron gives the electron magnetic moment in Bohr magnetons, g/2 = 1.001 159 652 180 73 (28) [0.28 ppt], with an uncertainty 2.7 and 15 times smaller than for previous measurements in 2006 and 1987. The electron is used as a magnetometer to allow lineshape statistics to accumulate, and its spontaneous emission rate determines the correction for its interaction with a cylindrical trap cavity. The new measurement and QED theory determine the fine structure constant, with alpha^{-1} = 137.035 999 084 (51) [0.37 ppb], and an uncertainty 20 times smaller than for any independent determination of alpha.",Human
"A generalization of non-perturbative QED model for high harmonic generation is developed for the multi-mode optical field case. By introducing classical-field-dressed quantized Volkov states analytically, a formula to calculate HHG for hydrogen-like atom in ultrashort intense laser pulse is obtained, which has a simple intuitive interpretation. The dressed state QED model indicates a new perspective to understand HHG, for example, the presence of the weak even-order harmonic photons, which has been verified by both theoretical analysis and numerical computation. Long wavelength approximation and strong field approximation are involved in the development of the formalism.",Human
"We use focused-ion-beam milling of a single-crystal Au surface to fabricate a 590-nm-long linear ridge that acts as a surface plasmon nanoresonator. Cathodoluminescence imaging spectroscopy is then used to excite and image surface plasmons on the ridge. Principal component analysis reveals distinct plasmonic modes, which proves confinement of surface-plasmon oscillations to the ridge. Boundary-element-method calculations confirm that a linear ridge is able to support highly-localized surface-plasmon modes (mode diameter < 100 nm). The results demonstrate that focused-ion-beam milling can be used in rapid prototyping of nanoscale single-crystal plasmonic components.",Human
"A detailed analysis of the most relevant sources of phase noise in an atomic interferometer is carried out, both theoretically and experimentally. Even a short interrogation time of 100 ms allows our cold atom gravimeter to reach an excellent short term sensitivity to acceleration of $1.4\times 10^{-8}$g at 1s. This result relies on the combination of a low phase noise laser system, efficient detection scheme and good shielding from vibrations. In particular, we describe a simple and robust technique of vibration compensation, which is based on correcting the interferometer signal by using the AC acceleration signal measured by a low noise seismometer.",Human
"This essay tells briefly of the life and work of one of the most successful scientists originating from a Balkan settlement whose name and popularity have greatly exceeded its realm. The word is of a discovery during WWII of the photostimulated aggregation of the F centers (else alkali atoms) dissolved from the vapor into an alkali halide crystal. Using optical absorption techniques while a grantee of Humboldt's Foundation in Goettingen, Germany between 1943-1944, he found new absorption bands pertaining to small-size F center aggregates and followed their interconversions. A primary photochemical solid state reaction was evidenced for the first time leading to nanoscale products.",Human
"In this paper we employ all-electron time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to calculate the long range dipole-dipole dispersion coefficient (van der Waals coefficient) $C_{6}$ of alkali-metal atoms Li, Na, K, alkali-metal atom dimers Li$_{2}$, Na$_{2}$, K$_{2}$ and sodium clusters containing even number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20 atoms. The dispersion coefficients are obtained via Casimir-Polder expression which relates it to the frequency dependent linear polarizabilty at imaginary frequencies. The frequency dependent polarizabilities are calculated by employing TDDFT--based complete sum-over-states expressions for the atoms, and direct TDDFT linear response theory for the closed shell dimers and clusters.",Human
In this paper we employ two distinct approaches - all-electron \textit{ab initio} method and the spherical jellium background model- within time dependent density functional theory to calculate the long range dipole-dipole dispersion coefficient (van der Waals coefficient) $C_{6}$ of sodium atom clusters containing even number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20 atoms. The dispersion coefficients are obtained via Casimir-Polder relation. All the calculations are carried out with local density approximation for exchange-correlation energy functional. These two sets of results are compared to assess the accuracy of jellium based results and to ascertain the effect of detail ionic structure of the clusters on the van der Waals coefficient.,Human
"We analyze the multifractal spectra of daily foreign exchange rates for Japan, Hong-Kong, Korea, and Thailand with respect to the United States Dollar from 1991 to 2005. We find that the return time series show multifractal spectrum features for all four cases. To observe the effect of the Asian currency crisis, we also estimate the multifractal spectra of limited series before and after the crisis. We find that the Korean and Thai foreign exchange markets experienced a significant increase in multifractality compared to Hong-Kong and Japan. We also show that the multifractality is stronge related to the presence of high values of returns in the series.",Human
"I offer some historical comments about the origins of Feynman's path integral approach, as an alternative approach to standard quantum mechanics. Looking at the interaction between Einstein and Feynman, which was mediated by Feynman's thesis supervisor John Wheeler, it is argued that, contrary to what one might expect, the significance of the interaction between Einstein and Feynman pertained to a critique of classical field theory, rather than to a direct critique of quantum mechanics itself. Nevertheless, the critical perspective on classical field theory became a motivation and point of departure for Feynman's space-time approach to non-relativistic quantum mechanics.",Human
"Most infrastructure networks evolve and operate in a decentralized fashion, which may adversely impact the allocation of resources across the system. Here we investigate this question by focusing on the relation between capacity and load in various such networks. We find that, due to network traffic fluctuations, real systems tend to have larger unoccupied portions of the capacities--smaller load-to-capacity ratios--on network elements with smaller capacities, which contrasts with key assumptions involved in previous studies. This finding suggests that infrastructure networks have evolved to minimize local failures but not necessarily large-scale failures that can be caused by the cascading spread of local damage.",Human
"In this paper, we investigate the self-affirmation effect on formation of public opinion in a directed small-world social network. The system presents a non-equilibrium phase transition from a consensus state to a disordered state with coexistence of opinions. The dynamical behaviors are very sensitive to the density of long-range interactions and the strength of self-affirmation. When the long-range interactions are sparse and individual generally does not insist on his/her opinion, the system will display a continuous phase transition, in the opposite case with high self-affirmation strength and dense long-range interactions, the system does not display a phase transition. Between those two extreme cases, the system undergoes a discontinuous phase transition.",Human
"We compare the experimental data of the first measurement of a temperature dependence of the Casimir-Polder force by Obrecht et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 063201 (2007)] with the theory taking into account small, but physically real, static conductivity of the dielectric substrate. The theory is found to be inconsistent with the data. The conclusion is drawn that the conductivity of dielectric materials should not be included in the model of the dielectric response in the Lifshitz theory. This conclusion obtained from the long separation measurement is consistent with related but different results obtained for semiconductors and metals at short separations.",Human
"We introduce our experiment of research-oriented teaching mainly in Nanjing University and Tsinghua University, China. The great population and enrollment in China makes it worth to concern. It lasts 20 years and involves thousands of students and hundreds of instructors, consultant experts. We tried many characteristic styles such as integrated teaching and case analysis, open resources, interactive mode, course paper program, elite solutions and so on. The research on the contents is also placed on the agenda. Many students joined research works that lead to PRL, APL, Nature, Science, and Cell papers. To impart colleagues the essence we offered some examples in every session. We declare the accomplishment of the experiment through this paper and new project is programming.",Human
"Few-cycle pulses of intense 800 nm light are used to probe ionization and dissociation of carbon disulfide in the intensity and temporal regime where rescattering is expected to dominate the laser-molecule interaction. The wavepacket of the rescattered electron destructively interferes with the anti-bonding $\pi$-orbital of CS$_2^+$ such that rescattering is effectively ""switched off"". Direct signature of enhanced ionization being ""switched off"" in the ultrashort domain is also obtained. Consequently, dissociation becomes an almost non-existent channel when few-cycle pulses are used, with only long-lived singly-, doubly-, and triply-charged molecular ions dominating the mass spectrum. Few-cycle optical pulses help reveal that quantum-mechanically determined molecular symmetry contributes to strong field molecular ionization.",Human
"The body of knowledge accumulated in recent years on the structure and the dynamics of complex networks has offered useful insights on the behaviour of many natural and artificial complex systems. The analysis of some of these, namely those formed by companies and institutions, however, has proved problematical mainly for the difficulties in collecting a reasonable amount of data. This contribution argues that the World Wide Web can provide an efficient and effective way to gather significant samples of networked socio-economic systems to be used for network analyses and simulations. The case discussed refers to a tourism destination, the fundamental subsystem of an industry which can be considered one of the most important in today's World economy.",Human
"The elementary structures of turbulence, i.e., vortex tubes, are studied using velocity data obtained in laboratory experiments for boundary layers and duct flows at microscale Reynolds numbers 332-1934. While past experimental studies focused on intense vortex tubes, the present study focuses on all vortex tubes with various intensities. We obtain the mean velocity profile. The radius scales with the Kolmogorov length. The circulation velocity scales with the Kolmogorov velocity, in contrast to the case of intense vortex tubes alone where the circulation velocity scales with the rms velocity fluctuation. Since these scaling laws are independent of the configuration for turbulence production, they appear to be universal at high Reynolds numbers.",Human
"Understanding the emergence of extreme opinions and in what kind of environment they might become less extreme is a central theme in our modern globalized society. A model combining continuous opinions and observed discrete actions (CODA) capable of addressing the important issue of measuring how extreme opinions might be has been recently proposed. In this paper I show extreme opinions to arise in a ubiquitous manner in the CODA model for a multitude of social network structures. Depending on network details reducing extremism seems to be possible. However, a large number agents with extreme opinions is always observed. A significant decrease in the number of extremists can be observed by allowing agents to change their positions in the network.",Human
"A painting consists of objects which are arranged in specific ways. The art of painting is drawing the objects, which can be considered as known trends, in an expressive manner. Detrended methods are suitable for characterizing the artistic works of the painter by eliminating trends. It means that we study the paintings, regardless of its apparent purpose, as a stochastic process. We apply multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the statistical properties of Mona Lisa, as an instance, to exhibit the fractality of the painting. Our results show that Mona Lisa is long range correlated and almost behaves similar in various scales.",Human
"We have detected Lyman alpha radiation as a product of the n(3He,t)p nuclear reaction occurring in a cell of 3He gas. The predominant source of this radiation appears to be decay of the 2p state of tritium produced by charge transfer and excitation collisions with the background 3He gas. Under the experimental conditions reported here we find yields of tens of Lyman alpha photons for every neutron reaction. These results suggest a method of cold neutron detection that is complementary to existing technologies that use proportional counters. In particular, this approach may provide single neutron sensitivity with wide dynamic range capability, and a class of neutron detectors that are compact and operate at relatively low voltages.",Human
"We investigate directly at the microscale the morphology of the electrowetting induced transition between the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states for a water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. Our experiments demonstrate that the transition originates in a very narrow annular region near the macroscopic contact line, which is first invaded by water and causes a thin film of air to be entrapped below. At high applied voltages, a growing fraction of microscopic air-pockets collapse, resulting in a partialWenzel state. Modulations in the intensity of the light reflected from individual micro-menisci clarify that the local contact angles near the filling transition are close to the usual advancing values for contact lines on smooth surfaces.",Human
"We report the first measurements and detailed analysis of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra (4 nm to 20 nm) of highly-charged tungsten ions W$^{54+}$ to W$^{63+}$ obtained with an electron beam ion trap (EBIT). Collisional-radiative modelling is used to identify strong electric-dipole and magnetic-dipole transitions in all ionization stages. These lines can be used for impurity transport studies and temperature diagnostics in fusion reactors, such as ITER. Identifications of prominent lines from several W ions were confirmed by measurement of isoelectronic EUV spectra of Hf, Ta, and Au. We also discuss the importance of charge exchange recombination for correct description of ionization balance in the EBIT plasma.",Human
"The peculiarity of the distribution and geometry of metallic ions in enzymes pushed us to set the hypothesis that metallic ions in active-site act like tiny antennas able to pick up very feeble e.m. signals. Enzymatic activity of Cu2+, Zn2+ Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) and Fe2+ Xanthine Oxidase (XO) has been studied, following in vitro generation and removal of free radicals. We observed that Superoxide radicals generation by XO is increased by a weak field having the Larmor frequency fL of Fe2+ while the SOD1 kinetics is sensibly reduced by exposure to a weak field having the frequency fL of Cu2+ ion.",Human
"We report and discuss case study simulations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the Boussinesq, incompressible regime developed to turbulence. Our main focus is on a statistical analysis of density and velocity fluctuations inside of the already developed and growing in size mixing zone. Novel observations reported in the manuscript concern self-similarity of the velocity and density fluctuations spectra inside of the mixing zone snapshot, independence of the spectra of the horizontal slice level, and universality showing itself in a virtual independence of the internal structure of the mixing zone, measured in the re-scaled spatial units, of the initial interface perturbations.",Human
"The study deals with a rotor-stator contact inducing vibration in rotating machinery. A numerical rotor-stator system, including a non-linear bearing with Hertz contact and clearance is considered. To determine the non-linear responses of this system, non-linear dynamic equations can be integrated numerically. However, this procedure is both time consuming and costly to perform. The aim of this Note is to apply the Alternate Frequency/Time Method and the 'path following continuation' in order to obtain the non-linear responses to this problem. Then the orbits of rotor and stator responses at various speeds are investigated.",Human
"The invariance of the phase of plane waves among inertial frames is investigated in some details. The reason that eventually led the author of a recent EPL letter [EPL \textbf{79}, 1006 (2007)] to a spurious conclusion of the non-invariance of the phase of waves has been identified -- it is the ignorance of the effect of relativistically-induced optical anisotropy in the analysis of the problem. It is argued that the Lorentz-invariant expression for the phase of waves should be taken in the form $\Phi=\mathbf{k\cdot r}-\mathbf{k\cdot u}/c$, instead of the widely-used expression $\Phi=\mathbf{k\cdot r}-\omega t$ which has a limited validity.",Human
"In the perspective of the outstanding developments of high-precision measurements of fundamental constants using polar molecules related to ultimate checks of fundamental theories, we investigate the possibly counterproductive role of black-body radiation on a series of diatomic molecules which would be trapped and observed for long durations. We show that the absorption of black-body radiation at room temperature may indeed limit the lifetime of trapped molecules prepared in a well-defined quantum state. Several examples are treated, corresponding to pure rotational absorption, pure vibrational absorption or both. We also investigate the role of a black-body radiation-induced energy shift on molecular levels and how it could affect high-precision frequency measurements.",Human
"A fast, switchable electro-optic radial polarization retarder (EO-RPR) fabricated using the electro-optic ceramic PMN-PT is presented. This EO-RPR is useful for fast, switchable generation of pure cylindrical vector beam. When used together with a pair of half-wave plates, the EO-RPR can change circularly polarized light into any cylindrical vector beam of interest such as radially or azimuthally polarized light. Radially and azimuthally polarized light with purities greater than 95% are generated experimentally. The advantages of using EO-RPR include fast response times, low driving voltage and transparency in a wide spectral range (500 -7000 nm).",Human
"We present fully empirical exchange-correlation functionals to be used within reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT). These are of the popular J-K form, where the function of the occupation numbers that multiplies the Fock orbital term is written as a Pade approximant. The coefficients of the Pade are optimized for a testset of eight molecules, and then refined for a larger set of 35 molecules. Two different approaches were tried, either keeping the self-interaction terms, or by removing them explicitly from the functional. The functionals thus obtained involve very few parameters, but are able to outperform other RDMFT functionals, yielding correlation energies that are, on average, even slightly better than Moeller-Plesset MP2 theory.",Human
"We employ a combination of optical UV- and electron-beam-lithography to create an atom chip combining sub-micron wire structures with larger conventional wires on a single substrate. The new multi-layer fabrication enables crossed wire configurations, greatly enhancing the flexibility in designing potentials for ultra cold quantum gases and Bose-Einstein condensates. Large current densities of >6 x 10^7 A/cm^2 and high voltages of up to 65 V across 0.3 micron gaps are supported by even the smallest wire structures. We experimentally demonstrate the flexibility of the next generation atom chip by producing Bose-Einstein condensates in magnetic traps created by a combination of wires involving all different fabrication methods and structure sizes.",Human
"We study the dynamic behavior of ultracold neutral atoms in a macroscopic ac electric trap. Confinement in such a trap is achieved by switching between two saddle-point configurations of the electric field. The gradual formation of a stably trapped cloud is observed and the trap performance is studied versus the switching frequency and the symmetry of the switching cycle. Additionally, the electric field in the trap is mapped out by imaging the atom cloud while the fields are still on. Finally, the phase-space acceptance of the trap is probed by introducing a modified switching cycle. The experimental results are reproduced using full three-dimensional trajectory calculations.",Human
"We investigate the time-dependent nonlinear optical absorption of a clay dispersion (Laponite) in organic dye (Rhodamine B) water solution displaying liquid-arrested state transition. Specifically, we determine the characteristic time $\tau_D$ of the nonlinear susceptibility build-up due as to the Soret effect. By comparing $\tau_D$ with the relaxation time provided by standard dynamic light scattering measurements we report on the decoupling of the two collective diffusion times at the two very different length scales during the aging of the out-of-equilibrium system. With this demonstration experiment we also show the potentiality of nonlinear optics measurements in the study of the late stage of arrest in soft materials.",Human
"Assembly/Disassembly (A/D) simulations using haptic devices are facing difficulties while simulating insertion/extraction operations such as removing cylinders from holes. In order to address this configuration as well as others, an approach based on contact identification between components is presented in this paper. This approach can efficiently contribute either to a new A/D simulation preparation process relying on two types of shape representations (mesh and CAD NURBS models), or directly to the real time simulation process when it is performed with 6D haptic devices. The model processing pipeline is described and illustrated to show how information can be propagated and used for contact detection. Then, the contact identification process is introduced and illustrated through an example",Human
"Molecular motors transduce chemical energy obtained from hydrolizing ATP into mechanical work exerted against an external force. We calculate their efficiency at maximum power output for two simple generic models and show that the qualitative behaviour depends crucially on the position of the transition state. Specifically, we find a transition state near the initial state (sometimes characterized as a ""power stroke"") to be most favorable with respect to both high power output and high efficiency at maximum power. In this regime, driving the motor further out of equilibrium by applying higher chemical potential differences can even, counter-intuitively, increase the efficiency.",Human
"We use the asymmetric simple exclusion process for describing vehicular traffic flow at the intersection of two streets. No traffic lights control the traffic flow. The approaching cars to the intersection point yield to each other to avoid collision. This yielding dynamics is model by implementing exclusion process to the intersection point of the two streets. Closed boundary condition is applied to the streets. We utilize both mean-field approach and extensive simulations to find the model characteristics. In particular, we obtain the fundamental diagrams and show that the effect of interaction between chains can be regarded as a dynamic impurity at the intersection point.",Human
"Isotope shifts in dielectronic recombination spectra were studied for Li-like ^{A}Nd^{57+} ions with A=142 and A=150. From the displacement of resonance positions energy shifts \delta E^{142,150}(2s-2p_1/2)= 40.2(3)(6) meV (stat)(sys)) and \delta E^{142,150}(2s-2p_3/2) = 42.3(12)(20) meV of 2s-2p_j transitions were deduced. An evaluation of these values within a full QED treatment yields a change in the mean-square charge radius of ^{142,150}\delta <r^2> = -1.36(1)(3) fm^2. The approach is conceptually new and combines the advantage of a simple atomic structure with high sensitivity to nuclear size.",Human
"We study the properties of arbitrary micro-swimmers towing a passive load through a viscous liquid. The simple close-form expression for the dragging efficiency of a general micro-swimmer dragging a distant load is found, and the leading order approximation for finite mutual separation is derived. We show that, while swimmer can be arbitrarily efficient, dragging efficiency is always bounded from above. It is also demonstrated, that opposite to Purcell's assumption, the hydrodynamic coupling can ''help"" the swimmer to drag the load. We support our conclusions by rigorous numerical calculations for the ""necklace-shaped"" swimmer, towing a spherical cargo positioned at a finite distance.",Human
"Using a combination of theory and computer simulations, we study the translocation of an RNA molecule, pulled through a solid-state nanopore by an optical tweezer, as a method to determine its secondary structure. The resolution with which the elements of the secondary structure can be determined is limited by thermal fluctuations. We present a detailed study of these thermal fluctuations, including the frequency spectrum, and show that these rule out single-nucleotide resolution under the experimental conditions which we simulated. Two possible ways to improve this resolution are strong stretching of the RNA with a back-pulling voltage across the membrane, and stiffening of the translocated part of the RNA by biochemical means.",Human
In this paper the Landscape potential is considered as an environment for system: trajectory-environment (TE). The trajectory is generating a measure on the landscape. The entropy of this dynamic measure is a power factor for trajectory. This dynamics leads to a memory appearance and produces a non-singular measure practically independently from initial conditions. It is shown that measure is dual to the metrics and its evolution may be considered as the landscape deformations: production-destruction of attractors-vacua. It seems like the renormalization process with phase transitions: renormgroup quantization. It is shown what the entropy of this global landscape measure acts on the trajectory alike a dark energy.,Human
"The Weibel instability in the quantum plasma case is treated by means of a fluid-like (moments) approach. Quantum modifications to the macroscopic equations are then identified as effects of first or second kind. Quantum effects of the first kind correspond to a dispersive term, similar to the Bohm potential in the quantum hydrodynamic equations for plasmas. Effects of the second kind are due to the Fermi statistics of the charge carriers and can become the dominant influence for strong degeneracy. The macroscopic dispersion relations are of higher order than those for the classical Weibel instability. This corresponds to the presence of a cutoff wave-number even for the strong temperature anisotropy case.",Human
"Recent rsearches have shown that the lengths of the chemical bonds, whether completely or partially covalent or ionic, are sums of the radii of the adjacent atoms and/or ions. On investigating the bond length data for the molecular components of nucleic acids, all were found (for the first time) to be effectively the sums of the covalent radii of the adjacent atoms. This work shows that the bond lengths in caffeine and related molecules are likewise sums of the covalent radii of C, N, O and H. This has enabled arriving at the atomic structures of these molecules, also for the first time.",Human
"Using a multi-scaled, chaotic flow known as the KS model of turbulence, we investigate the dependence of Lyapunov exponents on various characteristics of the flow. We show that the KS model yields a power law relation between the Reynolds number and the maximum Lyapunov exponent, which is similar to that for a turbulent flow with the same energy spectrum. Our results show that the Lyapunov exponents are sensitive to the advection of small eddies by large eddies, which can be explained by considering the Lagrangian correlation time of the smallest scales. We also relate the number of stagnation points within a flow to the maximum Lyapunov exponent, and suggest a linear dependence between the two characteristics.",Human
"A damping strategy for blisks (integrally bladed disks) of turbomachinery involving a friction ring is investigated. These rings, located in grooves underside the wheel of the blisks, are held in contact by centrifugal loads and the energy is dissipated when relative motions between the ring and the disk occur. A representative lumped parameter model of the system is introduced and the steady-state nonlinear response is derived using a multi-harmonic balance method combined with an AFT procedure where the friction force is calculated in the time domain. Numerical simulations are presented for several damper characteristics and several excitation configurations. From these results, the performance of this damping strategy is discussed and some design guidelines are given.",Human
"Given the recent tragedy involving a 350 pound Siberian Tiger and the death of teenager Carlos Souza Jr., one must ask a fundamental question: Can a tiger overcome an obstacle that is thirty-three feet away and twelve and a half feet tall? Are these dimensions sufficient enough to protect the zoo-visitors from a potential escape and/or attack? To answer these questions we use simple two-dimensional projectile motion to find the minimum velocity a tiger needs in order to clear the obstacle. With our results we conclude that it is highly likely that the tiger was able to leap over the obstacle with ease!",Human
We present a new theory that the molecular high order harmonic generation in an intense laser field is determined by molecular internal symmetry and momentum distribution of the tunneling-ionized electron. The molecular internal symmetry determines the quantum interference form of the returning electron inside the molecule. The electron momentum distribution determines the relative interference strength of each individual electron de Broglie wave. All individual electron de Broglie wave interferences add together to collectively modulate the molecular high harmonic generation. We specifically discuss the suppression of the generation on adjacent harmonic orders and the dependence of molecular high harmonic generation on laser intensities and molecular axis alignment. Our theoretical results are in good consistency with the experimental observations.,Human
"In the present article we introduce a quantum mechanism which is able to describe the creation of correlations in the evaluation of random independent events: such correlations, known as positive and negative recency, correspond respectively to the hot hand's and to the gambler's fallacies. Thus we propose a description of these effects in terms of qubits, which may become entangled, forming a system which can not be described completely only in terms of its constituents. We show that such formalism is able to describe and interpret the experimental results, thus providing a general and unifying framework for the cognitive heuristics.",Human
"UV photoinduced fragmentation of protonated aromatics amino acids have emerged the last few years, coming from a situation where nothing was known to what we think a good understanding of the optical properties. We will mainly focus this review on the tryptophan case. Three groups have mostly done spectroscopic studies and one has mainly been involved in dynamics studies of the excited states in the femtosecond/picosecond range and also in the fragmentation kinetics from nanosecond to millisecond. All these data, along with high level ab initio calculations, have shed light on the role of the different electronic states of the protonated molecules upon the fragmentation mechanisms.",Human
"We elaborate on a Hilbert-Schmidt distance measure assessing the intrinsic metrological accuracy in the detection of signals imprinted on quantum probe states by signal-dependent transformations. For small signals this leads to a probe-transformation measure $\Lambda$ fully symmetric on the probe $\rho$ and the generator $G$ of the transformation $\Lambda (\rho, G) = \Lambda (G, \rho)$. Although $\Lambda$ can be regarded as a generalization of variance we show that no uncertainty relation holds for the product of measures corresponding to complementary generators. We show that all states with resolution larger than coherent states are nonclassical. We apply this formalism to feasible probes and transformations.",Human
"Many musical instruments, as for example woodwind instruments, flute or violins, are self-sustained oscillating systems, i.e. musician enacts as a continuous energy source to drive an oscillation in the passive resonator, the body of the instrument, by means of a nonlinear coupling. For single reed instruments like clarinet, there exists a minimal value of mouth pressure beyond which sound can appear. This paper deals with the analysis of this oscillation threshold, calculated using a modal decomposition of the resonator, in order to have a better comprehension of how reed characteristics, such as its strength and its damping, may influence the attack transient of notes.",Human
"The understanding of inactivation radiobiological mechanism in individual cells is important when from one side the application of ionizing radiation to tumour therapy and from the other side the protection against radiation are to be effectively improved. Important part of this mechanism is double-strand break (DSB) formation; these DSB may be formed directly by impacting ionizing particles or indirectly by different secondary radicals. The latter kind of formation is much more frequent when cells contain normal water content. Mathematical model of the corresponding chemical stage will be presented with the aim to demonstrate how the individual radicals, but also other chemical agents present in the water during irradiation may influence DSB formation.",Human
"We explore stimulated photo-association in the context of attosecond pump-probe schemes of atomic matter. An attosecond pulse -- the probe -- is used to induce photo-association of an electronic wave packet which had been created before, typically with an attosecond pump pulse at an atomic center different from the one of photo-association. We will show that the electron absorption is maximal for a certain delay between the pulses. Two ways of enhancing and controlling stimulated photo-association are proposed, namely using an additional infrared pulse to steer the electronic wave packet and using a train of attosecond pulses instead of a single pair. A direct application of ultrafast stimulated photo-association is the measurement of atomic distances.",Human
"Vanishing of the equilibrium Green-Kubo fluctuation expression for the friction coefficient of a massive particle moving in a finite-volume liquid is usually interpreted as an unphysical consequence of the finite volume. Here I show that it is a physical consequence of the finite mass of the rest of the system, which allows it to be dragged by the moving particle. As a consequence, it is sufficient to have two infinite masses in the liquid for the friction coefficient to be finite. In addition, I give the physical interpretation of different friction coefficients for two infinite-mass particles moving in the liquid.",Human
"We report measurement of inelastic loss in dense and cold metastable ytterbium (Yb[$^3P_2$]). Use of an optical far-off-resonance trap enables us to trap atoms in all magnetic sublevels, removing multichannel collisional trap loss from the system. Trapped samples of Yb[$^3P_2$] are produced at a density of 2$\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperature of 2 $\mu$K. We observe rapid two-body trap loss of Yb[$^3P_2$] and measure the inelastic collision rate constant 1.0(3)$\times10^{-11}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$. The existence of the fine-structure changing collisions between atoms in the $^3P_2$ state is strongly suggested.",Human
"Applying the space-charge forces of a low-energy electron beam can lead to a significant improvement of the beam-particle lifetime limit arising from the beam-beam interaction in a high-energy collider [1]. In this article we present the results of various beam experiments with electron lenses, novel instruments developed for the beam-beam compensation at the Tevatron, which collides 980-GeV proton and antiproton beams. We study the dependencies of the particle betatron tunes on the electron beam current, energy and position; we explore the effects of electron-beam imperfections and noises; and we quantify the improvements of the high-energy beam intensity and the collider luminosity lifetime obtained by the action of the Tevatron Electron Lenses.",Human
"Slow-light enhanced absorption in liquid-infiltrated photonic crystals has recently been proposed as a route to compensate for the reduced optical path in typical lab-on-a-chip systems for bio-chemical sensing applications. A simple perturbative expression has been applied to ideal structures composed of lossless dielectrics. In this work we study the enhancement in structures composed of lossy dielectrics such as a polymer. For this particular sensing application we find that the material loss has an unexpected limited drawback and surprisingly, it may even add to increase the bandwidth for low-index contrast systems such as polymer devices.",Human
"Laser cooling on weak transitions is a useful technique for reaching ultracold temperatures in atoms with multiple valence electrons. However, for strongly magnetic atoms a conventional narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT) is destabilized by competition between optical and magnetic forces. We overcome this difficulty in Er by developing an unusual narrow-line MOT that balances optical and magnetic forces using laser light tuned to the blue side of a narrow (8 kHz) transition. The trap population is spin-polarized with temperatures reaching below 2 microkelvin. Our results constitute an alternative method for laser cooling on weak transitions, applicable to rare-earth-metal and metastable alkaline earth elements.",Human
"We investigate the effect of nonlinearity in a system described by an adiabatically evolving Hamiltonian. Experiments are conducted in a three-core waveguide structure that is adiabatically varying with distance, in analogy to the STIRAP process in atomic physics. In the linear regime, the system exhibits an adiabatic power transfer between two waveguides which are not directly coupled, with negligible power recorded in the intermediate coupling waveguide. In the presence of nonlinearity the behavior of this configuration is drastically altered and the adiabatic light passage is found to critically depend on the excitation power. We show how this effect is related to the destruction of the dark state formed in the STIRAP configuration.",Human
"A sampling method for spin systems is presented. The spin lattice is written as the union of a nested sequence of sublattices, all but the last with conditionally independent spins, which are sampled in succession using their marginals. The marginals are computed concurrently by a fast algorithm; errors in the evaluation of the marginals are offset by weights. There are no Markov chains and each sample is independent of the previous ones; the cost of a sample is proportional to the number of spins (but the number of samples needed for good statistics may grow with array size). The examples include the Edwards-Anderson spin glass in three dimensions.",Human
"We explore the effect of discounting and experimentation in a simple model of interacting adaptive agents. Agents belong to either of two types and each has to decide whether to participate a game or not, the game being profitable when there is an excess of players of the other type. We find the emergence of large fluctuations as a result of the onset of a dynamical instability which may arise discontinuously (increasing the discount factor) or continuously (decreasing the experimentation rate). The phase diagram is characterized in detail and noise amplification close to a bifurcation point is identified as the physical mechanism behind the instability.",Human
"Equilibrium atomic configurations and electron energy structure of ethanol adsorbed on the Si (111) surface are studied by the first-principles density functional theory. Geometry optimization is performed by the total energy minimization method. Several equilibrium atomic configurations of ethanol, both undissociated and dissociated, on the Si (111) surface are found. Reaction pathways and predicted transition states are discussed in comparison with available experimental data in terms of the feasibility of the reactions occurring. Analysis of atom and orbital resolved projected density of states indicate substantial modifications of the Si surface valence and conduction bands due to the adsorption of ethanol affecting the electrical properties of the surface.",Human
"In previous papers, we have presented hyperbolic governing equations and jump conditions for barotropic fluid mixtures. Now we extend our results to the most general case of two-fluid conservative mixtures taking into account the entropies of components. We obtain governing equations for each component of the medium. This is not a system of conservation laws. Nevertheless, using Hamilton's principle we are able to obtain a complete set of Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. In particular, for the gas dynamics they coincide with classical jump conditions of conservation of momentum and energy. For the two-fluid case, the jump relations do not involve the conservation of the total momentum and the total energy.",Human
"Calculations are presented which use the molecular R-matrix with pseudo-states (MRMPS) method to treat electron impact electron detachment and electronic excitation of the carbon dimer anion. Resonances are found above the ionisation threshold of C$_2^-$ with $^1\Sigma^+_g$, $^1\Pi_g$ and $^3\Pi_g$ symmetry. These are shape resonances trapped by the effect of an attractive polarisation potential competing with a repulsive Coulomb interaction. The $\Pi_g$ resonances are found to give structure in the detachment cross section similar to that observed experimentally. Both excitation and detachment cross sections are found to be dominated by large impact parameter collisions whose contribution is modelled using the Born approximation.",Human
"Despite being the most popular methods of data analysis, Fourier-based techniques suffer from the problem of static resolution that is currently believed to be a fundamental limitation of the Fourier Transform. Although alternative solutions overcome this limitation, none provide the simplicity, versatility, and convenience of the Fourier analysis. The lack of convenience often prevents these alternatives from replacing classical spectral methods - even in applications that suffer from the limitation of static resolution.   This work demonstrates that, contrary to the generally accepted belief, the Fourier Transform can be generalized to the case of adaptive resolution. The generalized transform provides backward compatibility with classical spectral techniques and introduces minimal computational overhead.",Human
"We study resonance distributions in a circular dielectric cavity. It is shown that the decay-rate distribution has a peak structure and the details of the peak are consistent with the classical survival probability time distribution. We also investigate the behavior of the complex resonance positions at the small opening limit. At the large $n$ limit, the real part of complex resonance positions approaches the solutions with different $m$ of Dirichlet problem with a scale $n^{-2}$ and the imaginary part goes zero as $n^{-2m}$ for TM and $n^{-2(m+1)}$ for TE polarization, where $m$ is the order of the resonance.",Human
"We investigate a network model based on an infinite regular square lattice embedded in the Euclidean plane where the node connection probability is given by the geometrical distance of nodes. We show that the degree distribution in the basic model is sharply peaked around its mean value. Since the model was originally developed to mimic the social network of acquaintances, to broaden the degree distribution we propose its generalization. We show that when heterogeneity is introduced to the model, it is possible to obtain fat tails of the degree distribution. Meanwhile, the small-world phenomenon present in the basic model is not affected. To support our claims, both analytical and numerical results are obtained.",Human
"We observe a hyperfine anomaly in the measurement of the hyperfine splitting of the 6S_{1/2} excited level in rubidium. We perform two step spectroscopy using the 5S_{1/2}->5P_{1/2}->6S_{1/2} excitation sequence. We measure the splitting of the 6S1/2 level and obtain for the magnetic dipole constants of ^{85}Rb and ^{87}Rb A = 239.18(4) MHz and A=807.66(8) MHz, respectively. The hyperfine anomaly difference of_{87}delta_{85}=-0.0036(2) comes from the Bohr Weisskopf effect: a correction to the point interaction between the finite nuclear magnetization and the electrons, and agrees with that obtained in the 5S_{1/2} ground state.",Human
"We employ an evolutionary algorithm to investigate the optimal design of composite protectors using one-dimensional granular chains composed of beads of various sizes, masses, and stiffnesses. We define a fitness function using the maximum force transmitted from the protector to a ""wall"" that represents the body to be protected and accordingly optimize the {topology} (arrangement), {size}, and {material} of the chain. We obtain optimally randomized granular protectors characterized by high-energy equipartition and the transformation of incident waves into interacting solitary pulses. We consistently observe that the pulses traveling to the wall combine to form an extended (long-wavelength), small-amplitude pulse.",Human
"We describe a three-dimensional geometry that exhibits a repulsive Casimir force using ordinary metallic materials, as computed via an exact numerical method (no uncontrolled approximations). The geometry consists of a zippelike, glide-symmetric structure formed of interleaved metal brackets attached to parallel plates. Depending on the separation, the perpendicular force between the plates/brackets varies from attractive (large separations) to repulsive (intermediate distances) and back to attractive (close separations), with one point of stable equilibrium in the perpendicular direction. This geometry was motivated by a simple intuition of attractive interactions between surfaces, and so we also consider how a rough proximity force approximation of pairwise attractions compares to the exact calculations.",Human
"We investigated financial market data to determine which factors affect information flow between stocks. Two factors, the time dependency and the degree of efficiency, were considered in the analysis of Korean, the Japanese, the Taiwanese, the Canadian, and US market data. We found that the frequency of the significant information decreases as the time interval increases. However, no significant information flow was observed in the time series from which the temporal time correlation was removed. These results indicated that the information flow between stocks evidences time-dependency properties. Furthermore, we discovered that the difference in the degree of efficiency performs a crucial function in determining the direction of the significant information flow.",Human
"We observe magnetic trapping of atomic nitrogen (14^N) and cotrapping of ground state imidogen (14^NH, X-triplet-Sigma-). Both are loaded directly from a room temperature beam via buffer gas cooling. We trap approximately 1 * 10^11 14^N atoms at a peak density of 5 * 10^11 cm^-3 at 550 mK. The 12 +5/-3 s 1/e lifetime of atomic nitrogen in the trap is limited by elastic collisions with the helium buffer gas. Cotrapping of 14^N and 14^NH is accomplished, with 10^8 NH trapped molecules at a peak density of 10^8 cm^-3. We observe no spin relaxation of nitrogen in collisions with helium.",Human
"We demonstrate a hard x-ray probe of laser-aligned small molecules. To align small molecules with optical lasers, high intensities at nonresonant wavelengths are necessary. We use 95 ps pulses focused to 40 mum from an 800 nm Ti:sapphire laser at a peak intensity of 10^12 W/cm^2 to create an ensemble of aligned bromotrifluoromethane (CF3Br) molecules. Linearly polarized, 120 ps x-ray pulses, focused to 10 mum, tuned to the Br 1s --> sigma* pre-edge resonance at 13.476 keV, probe the ensemble of laser-aligned molecules. The demonstrated methodology has a variety of applications and can enable ultrafast imaging of laser-controlled molecular motions with Angstrom-level resolution.",Human
"We study the heat transfer between two parallel metallic semi-infinite media with a gap in the nanometer-scale range. We show that the near-field radiative heat flux saturates at distances smaller than the metal skin depth when using a local dielectric constant and investigate the origin of this effect. The effect of non-local corrections is analysed using the Lindhard-Mermin and Boltzmann-Mermin models. We find that local and non-local models yield the same heat fluxes for gaps larger than 2 nm. Finally, we explain the saturation observed in a recent experiment as a manifestation of the skin depth and show that heat is mainly dissipated by eddy currents in metallic bodies.",Human
"We show that a simple and intuitive three-parameter equation fits remarkably well the evolution of the gross domestic product (GDP) in current and constant dollars of many countries during times of recession and recovery. We then argue that this equation is the response function of the economy to isolated shocks, hence that it can be used to detect large and small shocks, including those which do not lead to a recession; we also discuss its predictive power. Finally, a two-sector toy model of recession and recovery illustrates how the severity and length of recession depends on the dynamics of transfer rate between the growing and failing parts of the economy.",Human
"The solar corona is a complex system, with nonisothermal plasma and being in the self-gravitating field of the Sun. So the corona plasma is not only a nonequilibrium system but also a nonextensive one. We estimate the parameter of describing the degree of nonextensivity of the corona plasma and study the generalization of the solar wind speed theory in the framework of nonextensive statistical mechanics. It is found that, when use Chapman's corona model (1957) as the radial distribution of the temperature in the corona, the nonextensivity reduces the gas pressure outward and thus leads a significant deceleration effect on the radial speed of the solar wind.",Human
"The equilibrium statistical properties of DNA denaturation bubbles are examined in detail within the framework of the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model. Bubble formation in homogeneous DNA is found to depend crucially on the presence of nonlinear base-stacking interactions. Small bubbles extending over less than 10 base pairs are associated with much larger free energies of formation per site than larger bubbles. As the critical temperature is approached, the free energy associated with further bubble growth becomes vanishingly small. An analysis of average displacement profiles of bubbles of varying sizes at different temperatures reveals almost identical scaled shapes in the absence of nonlinear stacking; nonlinear stacking leads to distinct scaled shapes of large and small bubbles.",Human
"A novel approach to unstructured quadrilateral mesh generation for planar domains is presented. Away from irregular vertices, the resulting meshes have the properties of nearly conformal grids. The technique is based on a theoretical relation between the present problem, and the inverse Poisson (IP) problem with point sources. An IP algorithm is described, which constructs a point-source distribution, whose sources correspond to the irregular vertices of the mesh. Both the background theory and the IP algorithm address the global nature of the mesh generation problem. The IP algorithm is incorporated in a complete mesh generation scheme, which also includes an algorithm for creating the final mesh. Example results are presented and discussed.",Human
"For partial wetting, motion of the triple liquid-gas-solid contact line is influenced by heterogeneities of the solid surface. This influence can be strong in the case of inertial (e.g. oscillation) flows where the line can be pinned or move intermittently. A model that takes into account both surface defects and fluid inertia is proposed. The viscous dissipation in the bulk of the fluid is assumed to be negligible as compared to the dissipation in the vicinity of the contact line. The equations of motion and the boundary condition at the contact line are derived from Hamilton's principle. The rapid capillary rise along a vertical inhomogeneous wall is treated as an example.",Human
"We study propagation of light in nonlinear diffraction-managed photonic lattices created with arrays of periodically-curved coupled optical waveguides which were fabricated using femtosecond laser writing in silica glass, and titanium indiffusion in LiNbO3 crystals. We identify different regimes of the nonlinear propagation of light beams depending on the input power, and present the first experimental observation of diffraction-managed solitons, which are formed as a result of the interplay between the engineered beam diffraction and nonlinear self-focusing or defocusing. We observe that in self-collimating structures where linear diffraction is suppressed, a novel regime of nonlinear beam diffusion takes place at the intermediate powers before the lattice soliton is formed at higher powers.",Human
"Many networks extent in space, may it be metric (e.g. geographic) or non-metric (ordinal). Spatial network growth, which depends on the distance between nodes, can generate a wide range of topologies from small-world to linear scale-free networks. However, networks often lacked multiple clusters or communities. Multiple clusters can be generated, however, if there are time windows during development. Time windows ensure that regions of the network develop connections at different points in time. This novel approach could generate small-world but not scale-free networks. The resulting topology depended critically on the overlap of time windows as well as on the position of pioneer nodes.",Human
"Elastic and inelastic properties of weakly bound s- and p-wave molecules of fermionic atoms that collide with a third atom are investigated. Analysis of calculated collisional properties of s-wave dimers of fermions in different spin states permit us to compare and highlight the physical mechanisms that determine the stability of s-wave and p-wave molecules. In contrast to s-wave molecules, the collisional properties of p-wave molecules are found to be largely insensitive to variations of the p-wave scattering length and that these collisions will usually result in short molecular lifetimes. We also discuss the importance of this result for both theories and experiments involving degenerate Fermi gases.",Human
"In self-gravitating stars, two dimensional or geophysical flows and in plasmas, long range interactions imply a lack of additivity for the energy; as a consequence, the usual thermodynamic limit is not appropriate. However, by contrast with many claims, the equilibrium statistical mechanics of such systems is a well understood subject. In this proceeding, we explain briefly the classical approach to equilibrium and non equilibrium statistical mechanics for these systems, starting from first principles. We emphasize recent and new results, mainly a classification of equilibrium phase transitions, new unobserved equilibrium phase transition, and out of equilibrium phase transitions. We briefly discuss what we consider as challenges in this field.",Human
"We discuss the probability distribution of relative speed $\Delta V$ of inertial particles suspended in a highly turbulent gas when the Stokes numbers, a dimensionless measure of their inertia, is large. We identify a mechanism giving rise to the distribution $P(\Delta V) \sim \exp(-C |\Delta V|^{4/3})$ (for some constant $C$). Our conclusions are supported by numerical simulations and the analytical solution of a model equation of motion. The results determine the rate of collisions between suspended particles. They are relevant to the hypothesised mechanism for formation of planets by aggregation of dust particles in circumstellar nebula.",Human
"The paper presents a new stiffness modelling method for overconstrained parallel manipulators, which is applied to 3-d.o.f. translational mechanisms. It is based on a multidimensional lumped-parameter model that replaces the link flexibility by localized 6-d.o.f. virtual springs. In contrast to other works, the method includes a FEA-based link stiffness evaluation and employs a new solution strategy of the kinetostatic equations, which allows computing the stiffness matrix for the overconstrained architectures and for the singular manipulator postures. The advantages of the developed technique are confirmed by application examples, which deal with comparative stiffness analysis of two translational parallel manipulators.",Human
"We have selected and spatially separated the two conformers of 3-aminophenol (C$_6$H$_7$NO) present in a molecular beam. Analogous to the separation of ions based on their mass-to-charge ratios in a quadrupole mass filter, the neutral conformers are separated based on their different mass-to-dipole-moment ratios in an ac electric quadrupole selector. For a given ac frequency, the individual conformers experience different focusing forces, resulting in different transmissions through the selector. These experiments demonstrate that conformer-selected samples of large molecules can be prepared, offering new possibilities for the study of gas-phase biomolecules.",Human
"Isotope effects in reactions between Mg+ in the 3p 2P3/2 excited state and molecular hydrogen at thermal energies are studied through single reaction events. From only ~250 reactions with HD, the branching ratio between formation of MgD+ and MgH+ is found to be larger than 5. From additional 65 reactions with H2 and D2 we find that the overall decay probability of the intermediate MgH2+, MgHD+ or MgD2+ complexes is the same. Our study shows that few single ion reactions can provide quantitative information on ion-neutral reactions. Hence, the method is well-suited for reaction studies involving rare species, e.g., rare isotopes or short-lived unstable elements.",Human
"We study rank-size distribution of cities in Japan on the basis of data analysis. From the census data after World War II, we find that the rank-size distribution of cities is composed of two parts, each of which has independent power exponent. In addition, the power exponent of the head part of the distribution changes in time and Zipf's law holds only in a restricted period. We show that Zipf's law broke down due to both of Showa and Heisei great mergers and recovered due to population growth in middle-sized cities after the great Showa merger.",Human
"Following the recent surge of interest in n-doped strontium titanate as a possible blue light emitter, a time-resolved photoluminescence analysis was performed on nominally pure, Nb-doped and oxygen-deficient single-crystal SrTiO3 samples. The doping-effects on both the electronic states involved in the transition and the decay mechanism are respectively analyzed by comparing the spectral and dynamic features and the yields of the emission. Our time-resolved analysis, besides shedding some light on the basic recombination mechanisms acting in these materials, sets the intrinsic bandwidth limit of the proposed blue light emitting optoelectronic devices made of Ti-based perovskites heterostructures in the GHz range.",Human
This paper reviews the linearized path integral approach for computing time dependent properties of systems that can be approximated using a mixed quantum-classical description. This approach is applied to studying vibrational pure dephasing of ground state molecular iodine in a rare gas matrix. The Feynman-Kleinert optimized harmonic approximation for the full system density operator is used to sample initial conditions for the bath degrees of freedom. This extremely efficient approach is compared with alternative initial condition sampling techniques at low temperatures where classical initial condition sampling yields dephasing rates that are nearly an order of magnitude too slow compared with quantum initial condition sampling and experimental results.,Human
"Current concerns over reforming engineering education have focused attention on helping students develop skills and an adaptive expertise. Phenomenological guidelines for instruction along these lines can be understood as arising out of an emerging theory of thinking and learning built on results in the neural, cognitive, and behavioral sciences. We outline this framework and consider some of its implications for one example: developing a more detailed understanding of the specific skill of using mathematics in modeling physical situations. This approach provides theoretical underpinnings for some best-practice instructional methods designed to help students develop this skill and providesguidance for further research in the area.",Human
"Myron Mathisson (1897-1940) was a Polish Jew known for his work on the equations of motion of bodies in general relativity and for developing a new method to analyze the properties of fundamental solutions of linear hyperbolic differential equations. In particular, he derived the equations for a spinning body moving in a gravitational field and proved, in a special case, the Hadamard conjecture on the class of equations that satisfy the Huygens principle. His work still exerts influence on current research. Drawing on various archival and secondary sources, in particular his correspondence with Einstein, we outline Mathisson's biography and scientific career.",Human
"The purpose of this communication is to discuss the simulation of a free surface compressible flow between two fluids, typically air and water. We use a two fluid model with the same velocity, pressure and temperature for both phases. In such a numerical model, the free surface becomes a thin three dimensional zone. The present method has at least three advantages: (i) the free-surface treatment is completely implicit; (ii) it can naturally handle wave breaking and other topological changes in the flow; (iii) one can easily vary the Equation of States (EOS) of each fluid (in principle, one can even consider tabulated EOS). Moreover, our model is unconditionally hyperbolic for reasonable EOS.",Human
A general description of the long-range elastic interaction is proposed. The far-field type of the interaction is determined by the way of symmetry breaking of the distribution of the elastic field produced by the topological defect as isolated inclusions. Every topological defect can be present as the source of the elastic field and can be described in the terms of this field. At the short distance the source can be described as nonlinear object which present charge of linear theory of elastic field at the far distance. In this article the nonlinear models of source of a elastic field was proposed.,Human
"A model is proposed to explain the observed correlation between monthly fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures. The model relies on the oceans being in a temperature-dependent equilibrium with the atmosphere. When temperature changes, the system attempts to restore the equilibrium, with a time constant constrained by the dynamic fluxes between the two. The model is used to reconstruct both the historic evolution of CO2 concentrations since 1885, as well as the monthly fluctuations since 1959. The best fit is obtained with the southern hemisphere sea surface temperature data. In this new picture, human emissions play no role in the build-up of atmospheric CO2, but do contribute to the fluxes that restore the equilibrium.",Human
"A scheme for fast, compact, and controllable acceleration of heavy particles in vacuum is proposed, in which two counterpropagating lasers with variable frequencies drive a beat-wave structure with variable phase velocity, thus allowing for trapping and acceleration of heavy particles, such as ions or muons. Fine control over the energy distribution and the total charge of the beam is obtained via tuning of the frequency variation. The acceleration scheme is described with a one-dimensional theory, providing the general conditions for trapping and scaling laws for the relevant features of the particle beam. Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations confirm the validity and the robustness of the physical mechanism.",Human
"While nonlinear optical spectroscopy is becoming more commonly used to study the excited states of nonlinear-optical systems, a general theory of inhomogeneous broadening is rarely applied in lieu of either a simple Lorentzian or Gaussian model. In this work, we generalize all the important linear and second-order nonlinear susceptibility expressions obtained with sum-over state quantum calculations to include Gaussian and stretched Gaussian distributions of Lorentzians. We show that using the correct model to analyze experiments that probe a limited wavelength range can be critical and that this theory is better able to fit the subtle spectral features - such as the shoulder region of a resonance - when both models produce qualitatively similar responses.",Human
"Analytical non-perturbative study of the three-dimensional nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation with additive thermal noise, analogous to that proposed by V.N. Nikolaevskii [1]-[5]to describe longitudinal seismic waves, is presented. The equation has a threshold of short-wave instability and symmetry, providing long wave dynamics. New mechanism of quantum chaos generating in nonlinear dynamical systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom is proposed. The hypothesis is said, that physical turbulence could be identified with quantum chaos of considered type. It is shown that the additive thermal noise destabilizes dramatically the ground state of the Nikolaevskii system thus causing it to make a direct transition from a spatially uniform to a turbulent state.",Human
"We solve the (2+1)D nonlinear Helmholtz equation (NLH) for input beams that collapse in the simpler NLS model. Thereby, we provide the first ever numerical evidence that nonparaxiality and backscattering can arrest the collapse. We also solve the (1+1)D NLH and show that solitons with radius of only half the wavelength can propagate over forty diffraction lengths with no distortions. In both cases we calculate the backscattered field, which has not been done previously. Finally, we compute the dynamics of counter-propagating solitons using the NLH model, which is more comprehensive than the previously used coupled NLS model.",Human
"We theoretically analyze three-mode opto-acoustic parametric interactions in a coupled Fabry-Perot cavity, where one acoustic mode interacts with two optical modes. We show explicitly that extra degrees of freedom in a coupled cavity allow explorations of both parametric instability and cooling regimes with high parametric gain in a single table top experiment. This work can motivate experimental realizations of the three-mode parametric instability which might be an issue in next-generation gravitational-wave detectors with high optical-power cavities, helping in the development of better models, and in developing techniques for controls. In addition, we show that the same scheme can be implemented in the resolved-sideband acoustic-mode cooling.",Human
"We propose a new method to obtain approximate solutions for the Schr\""{o}dinger equation with an arbitrary potential that possesses bound states. This method, relying on the auxiliary field technique, allows in many cases to find analytical solutions. It offers a convenient way to study the qualitative features of the energy spectrum of bound states in any potential. In particular, we illustrate our method by solving the case of central potentials with power-law form and with logarithmic form. For these types of potentials, we propose very accurate analytical energy formulae which improve a lot the corresponding formulae that can be found in literature.",Human
"We report new measurements of the infrared emission spectrum of Xe$_{2}$ excimers produced by electron impact in dense gas at room temperature. These measurements extend the density range previously explored by a factor of two. We have now reached a pressure $P\approx 3.3 $MPa, corresponding to a gas density $N\approx 8\cdot 10^{26} $m$^{-3}$ in both pure Xe gas and in a Ar--Xe mixture. The analysis of the changes of the spectrum induced by the interaction with the gaseous environment shows how cooperative-- and many-body effects develop with increasing density. We %will also show that quantum effects related to the indistinguishability of identical particles are observed even at such high temperature.",Human
"We study the dynamics of epidemic and reaction-diffusion processes in metapopulation models with heterogeneous connectivity pattern. In SIR-like processes, along with the standard local epidemic threshold, the system exhibits a global invasion threshold. We provide an explicit expression of the threshold that sets a critical value of the diffusion/mobility rate below which the epidemic is not able to spread to a macroscopic fraction of subpopulations. The invasion threshold is found to be affected by the topological fluctuations of the metapopulation network. The presented results provide a general framework for the understanding of the effect of travel restrictions in epidemic containment.",Human
The quantum resonances of an atom possessing a single valence electron which shows hyperfine interaction with the nucleus is investigated in the presence of a three dimensional magnetic quadrupole field. Particular emphasis is put on the study of the interplay of the hyperfine and quadrupole forces. Analyzing the underlying Hamiltonian a variety of symmetries are revealed which give rise to a two-fold degeneracy of the resonance energies. Our numerical approach employs the complex scaling method and a Sturmian basis set. Several regimes and classes of short-lived and long-lived resonances are identified. The energies and decay widths of the resonances are characterized by their electronic and nuclear spin properties.,Human
"In this paper we investigate x-ray and $\gamma$-ray propagation in crystals having a constant strain gradient and flat or cylindrical surfaces. When a displacement field is present, we solve the Takagi-Taupin equations either by the Riemann-Green method or by a numerical method. We apply the results to study the operation of a double-crystal Laue-Laue diffractometer having a flat collimating crystal followed by a bent analyzer crystal. In particular, we examine the effect of the analyzer strain on the location of the diffraction peaks in the dispersive and non-dispersive setup, thus confirming our previously reported peak-location as being set only by the diffracting plane spacing on the analyzer entrance surface.",Human
"We present a collection of eight data sets, from state-of-the-art experiments and numerical simulations on turbulent velocity statistics along particle trajectories obtained in different flows with Reynolds numbers in the range $R_\lambda \in [120:740]$. Lagrangian structure functions from all data sets are found to collapse onto each other on a wide range of time lags, revealing a universal statistics, and calling for a unified theoretical description. Parisi-Frisch Multifractal theory, suitable extended to the dissipative scales and to the Lagrangian domain, is found to capture intermittency of velocity statistics over the whole three decades of temporal scales here investigated.",Human
"Energy dissipation rate is an important parameter for nearly every experiment on turbulent flow. Mathematically precise relationships between energy dissipation rate and other measurable statistics for the case of anisotropic turbulence are useful to experimentalists. Such relationships are obtained for which the measurable statistics are the 3rd-order and 2nd-order velocity structure functions as well as the acceleration-velocity structure function. The relationships are derived using the Navier-Stokes equation without approximation. Approximate versions are obtained on the basis of local stationarity and local homogeneity. The latter are valid for arbitrary Reynolds numbers for the case of stationary, homogeneous turbulence. Precise use of the mathematics requires care noted in the Discussion section.",Human
"We study the interplay of hydrodynamic mesoscale structures and the growth of plankton in the wake of an island, and its interaction with a coastal upwelling. Our focus is on a mechanism for the emergence of localized plankton blooms in vortices. Using a coupled system of a kinematic flow mimicking the mesoscale structures behind the island and a simple three component model for the marine ecosystem, we show that the long residence times of nutrients and plankton in the vicinity of the island and the confinement of plankton within vortices are key factors for the appearance of localized plankton blooms",Human
"Fifty years ago, John von Neumann compared the architecture of the brain with that of computers that he invented and which is still in use today. In those days, the organisation of computers was based on concepts of brain organisation. Here, we give an update on current results on the global organisation of neural systems. For neural systems, we outline how the spatial and topological architecture of neuronal and cortical networks facilitates robustness against failures, fast processing, and balanced network activation. Finally, we discuss mechanisms of self-organization for such architectures. After all, the organization of the brain might again inspire computer architecture.",Human
"This document summarizes the findings of the Accelerator Working Group (AWG) of the International Scoping Study (ISS) of a Future Neutrino Factory and super-beam Facility. The work of the group took place at three plenary meetings along with three workshops, and an oral summary report was presented at the NuFact06 workshop held at UC-Irvine in August, 2006. The goal was to reach consensus on a baseline design for a Neutrino Factory complex. One aspect of this endeavor was to examine critically the advantages and disadvantages of the various Neutrino Factory schemes that have been proposed in recent years.",Human
"A technique is proposed to generate attosecond pulse trains of radiation from a Free-Electron Laser amplifier. The optics-free technique synthesises a comb of longitudinal modes by applying a series of spatio-temporal shifts between the co-propagating radiation and electron bunch in the FEL. The modes may be phase-locked by modulating the electron beam energy at the mode spacing frequency. Three-dimensional simulations demonstrate the generation of a train of 400as pulses at giga-watt power levels evenly spaced by 2.5fs at a wavelength of 124 Angstrom. In the X-ray at wavelength 1.5 Angstrom, trains of 23as pulses evenly spaced by 150as and of peak power up to 6GW are predicted.",Human
"""Symmetry"" was one of the most important methodological themes in 20th-century physics and is probably going to play no lesser role in physics of the 21st century. As used today, there are a variety of interpretations of this term, which differ in meaning as well as their mathematical consequences. Symmetries of crystals, for example, generally express a different kind of invariance than gauge symmetries, though in specific situations the distinctions may become quite subtle. I will review some of the various notions of ""symmetry"" and highlight some of their uses in specific examples taken from Pauli's scientific oevre.",Human
"In this work, Pseudo-Random Bit Generation (PRBG) based on 2D chaotic mappings of logistic type is considered. The sequences generated with two Pseudorandom Bit Generators (PRBGs) of this type are statistically tested and the computational effectiveness of the generators is estimated. The role played by the symmetry and the geometrical properties of the underlying chaotic attractors is also explored. Considering these PRBGs valid for cryptography, the size of the available key spaces are calculated. Additionally, a novel mechanism called 'symmetry-swap' is introduced in order to enhance the PRBG algorithm. It is shown that it can increase the degrees of freedom of the key space, while maintaining the speed and performance in the PRBG.",Human
"Food is an essential part of civilization, with a scope that ranges from the biological to the economic and cultural levels. Here we study the statistics of ingredients and recipes taken from Brazilian, British, French, and Medieval cookbooks. We find universal distributions with scale invariant behavior. We propose a copy-mutate process to model culinary evolution that fits very well our empirical data. We find a cultural founder effect produced by the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model. Both the invariant and idiosyncratic aspects of culture are accounted by our model, which may have applications in other kinds of evolutionary processes.",Human
"The paper is devoted to elaboration of a novel specific indicator based on the modified Holder exponents. This indicator has been used for forecasting critical points of financial time series and crashes of the USA stock market. The proposed approach is based on the hypothesis, which claims that before market critical points occur the dynamics of financial time series radically changes, namely time series become smoother. The approach has been tested on the stylized data and real USA stock market data. It has been shown that it is possible to forecast such critical points of financial time series as large upward and downward movements and trend changes. On this basis a new trading strategy has been elaborated and tested.",Human
A recent problem in community ecology lies in defining structures behind matrices of species interactions. The interest in this area is to quantify the nestedness degree of the matrix after its maximal packing. In this work we evaluate nestedness using the sum of all distances of the occupied sites to the vertex of the matrix. We calculate the distance for two artificial matrices with the same size and occupancy: a random matrix and a perfect nested one. Using these two benchmarks we develop a nestedness estimator. The estimator is applied to a set of 23 real networks of insect-plant interactions.,Human
"The base is the Lagrangian of symmetry and its dynamical breaking or Higgs breaking. When the soliton-like solutions of the scalar field equations are substituted into the spinor field equations, in the approximation of non-relativity we derive the Morse-type potential, whose energy spectrum is the GMO mass formula and its modified accurate mass formula. According to the symmetry of s-c quarks, the heavy flavor hadrons which made of u,d and c quarks may be classified by SU(3) octet and decuplet. Then some simple mass formulas are obtained, from this we predict some masses of unknown hadrons.",Human
"The Machian Universe, is usually described with Newtonian Physics, We give an alternative General Relativistic picture for Mach's Universe. As such, we show that, in the correct Machian limit, Schwarzschild's metric is coherent with Robertson-Walker's, on condition that there be a cosmological constant, or the Universe's rotation -- or both. It is now confirmed that the Universe is accelerating, so the former condition applies. The latter was also confirmed one more time with the recently discovered NASA space probes anomalies. From Kerr-Lense-Thirring solution, we find an inverse scale-factor dependent angular speed; we then, show that the cosmological ""constant"" may have Classically originated from a centrifugal acceleration field.",Human
"Angular momentum densities of electromagnetic beams are connected to helicity (circular polarization) and topological charge (azimuthal phase shift and vorticity). Computing the electromagnetic fields emitted by a circular antenna array, analytic expressions are found for the densities of energy, linear and angular momentum in terms of helicity and vorticity. It is found that the angular momentum density can be separated into spin and orbital parts, a result that is known to be true in a beam geometry. The results are of importance for information-rich radio astronomy and space physics as well as novel radio, radar, and wireless communication concepts.",Human
"We investigate the orientation dependence of molecular high-order harmonic generation (HHG) both numerically and analytically. We show that the molecular recollision electronic wave packets (REWPs) in the HHG are closely related to the ionization potential as well as the particular orbital from which it ionized. As a result, the spectral amplitude of the molecular REWP can be significantly different from its reference atom (i.e., with the same ionization potential as the molecule under study) in some energy regions due to the interference between the atomic cores of the molecules. This finding is important for molecular orbital tomography using HHG[Nature \textbf{432}, 867(2004)].",Human
"We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection method in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks. .",Human
"We apply wave packet methods to study an ion-trap system in the strong excitation regime imposing neither the rotating wave nor the Lamb-Dicke approximations. By this approach we show the existence of states with restricted phase space evolution, as a genuine consequence of quantum interference between wave packet fractions. A particular instance of such a state oscillates between maximal entanglement and pure disentanglement between the constitute subsystems. The characteristic crossover time is very rapid making them suitable for state preparations of EPR or Schrodinger cat states. Over longer time periods the dynamics of these states exhibits collapse-revival patterns with well resolved fractional revivals in autocorrelation, inversion and entanglement.",Human
"We propose a promising scheme to decelerate a cw filtering out molecular beam using a red-detuned quasi-cw semi-Gaussian laser beam. By using Monte-Carlo simulation method, we demonstrate this optical Stark deceleration scheme, and study its decelerated dynamic process for a cw ND3 molecular beam as well as the dependence of the deceleration effect on the border width of the semi-Gaussian beam. Our study shows that the proposed scheme can be used to efficiently slow a cw ND3 molecular beam, and obtain a relative average kinetic-energy loss of 9.33% by using a single semi-Gaussian beam with a well depth of 7.3 mK.",Human
"A dynamic herding model with interactions of trading volumes is introduced. At time $t$, an agent trades with a probability, which depends on the ratio of the total trading volume at time $t-1$ to its own trading volume at its last trade. The price return is determined by the volume imbalance and number of trades. The model successfully reproduces the power-law distributions of the trading volume, number of trades and price return, and their relations. Moreover, the generated time series are long-range correlated. We demonstrate that the results are rather robust, and do not depend on the particular form of the trading probability.",Human
"We propose a model of random diffusion to investigate flow fluctuations in complex networks. We derive an analytical law showing that the dependence of fluctuations with the mean traffic in a network is ruled by the delicate interplay of three factors, respectively of dynamical, topological and statistical nature. In particular, we demonstrate that the existence of a power-law scaling characterizing the flow fluctuations at every node in the network can not be claimed for. We show the validity of this scaling breakdown under quite general topological and dynamical situations by means of different traffic algorithms and by analyzing real data.",Human
"Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations are performed on the monocyclic and bicyclic forms of m-benzyne, which are the equilibrium structures at the CCSD(T) and CCSD levels of coupled cluster theory. We employed multi-configuration self-consistent field trial wave functions which are constructed from a carefully selected 8-electrons-in-8-orbitals complete active space [CAS(8,8)], with CSF coefficients that are reoptimized in the presence of a Jastrow factor. The DMC calculations show that the monocyclic structure is lower in energy than the bicyclic structure by 1.9(2) kcal/mole, in excellent agreement with the best coupled cluster results.",Human
"We report the observation of imaging beyond the diffraction limit due to bound surface states in negative refraction photonic crystals. We achieve an effective negative index figure-of-merit [-Re(n)/Im(n)] of at least 380, ~125x improvement over recent efforts in the near-infrared, with a 0.4 THz bandwidth. Supported by numerical and theoretical analyses, the observed near-field resolution is 0.47 lambda, clearly smaller than the diffraction limit of 0.61 lambda. Importantly, we show this sub-diffraction imaging is due to the resonant excitation of surface slab modes, allowing refocusing of non-propagating evanescent waves.",Human
"The representation of science as a citation-density landscape and the study of scaling rules with the field-specific citation-density as a main topological property was previously analysed at the level of research groups. Here the focus is on the individual researcher. In this new analysis, the size-dependence of several main bibliometric indicators for a large set of individual researchers is explored. Similar results as those previously observed for research groups are here described for individual researchers, reinforcing the idea of prevalent scaling rules in the representation of science as a citation-density landscape. Differences among thematic areas with different citation densities are discussed.",Human
"This paper provides a concise summary of the current status of the research and future perspectives discussed in the Mini-Conference on Angular Momentum Transport in Laboratory and Nature. This Mini-conference, sponsored by the Topical Group on Plasma Astrophysics, was held as part of the American Physical Society's Division of Plasma Physics 2007 Annual Meeting (November 12--16, 2007). This Mini-conference covers a wide range of phenomena happening in fluids and plasmas, either in laboratory or in nature. The purpose of this paper is not to comprehensively review these phenomena, but to provide a starting point for interested readers to refer to related research in areas other than their own.",Human
"Three-dimensional central symmetric bodies different from spheres that can float in all orientations are considered. For relative density rho=1/2 there are solutions, if holes in the body are allowed. For rho different from 1/2 the body is deformed from a sphere. A set of nonlinear shape-equations determines the shape in lowest order in the deformation. It is shown that a large number of solutions exists. An expansion scheme is given, which allows a formal expansion in the deformation to arbitrary order under the assumption that apart from x=0,+1,-1 there is no x, which obeys P_{p,2}(x)=0 for two different integer ps, where P are Legendre functions.",Human
"When moving from one arbitrary location at another, a parallel manipulator may change its assembly-mode without crossing a singularity. Because the non-singular change of assembly-mode cannot be simply detected, the actual assembly-mode during motion is difficult to track. This paper proposes a global explanatory approach to help better understand non-singular assembly-mode changing motions for 3-RPR planar parallel manipulators. The approach consists in fixing one of the actuated joints and analyzing the configuration-space as a surface in a 3-dimensional space. Such a global description makes it possible to display all possible non-singular assembly-mode changing trajectories.",Human
"Based on the concepts of the mechanics of unsaturated soils where capillary phenomena arise between the wetting fluid (water) and the non-wetting one (air), the subsidence of chalks containing oil (non-wetting fluid) during water injection (wetting fluid) is analysed. It is shown that the collapse phenomenon of unsaturated soils under wetting provides a physical explanation and a satisfactory prediction of the order of magnitude of the subsidence of the chalk. The use of a well established constitutive model for unsaturated soils allows a description of the hydro-mechanical history of the chalk, from its deposition to the oil exploitation.",Human
"The Universe, far to be homogenous, expands in large empty bubbles of the large-scale structure, but not in mass concentrations like galaxies, so that the Robertson-Walker solution does not fit. We suggest that a symmetry breaking occurred in a distant past, during the radiation-dominated era. Before, the three-dimensional hypersurface was invariant under the action of O(3) and the Robertson-Walker metric could be used. But this obliges the so-called constants and physics, length and time scale factors to be involved through a generalized gauge process, which is built. The subsequent variation of the speed of light solves the horizon problem, while the Planck barrier disappears",Human
"We perform an analysis of fractal properties of the positive and the negative changes of the German DAX30 index separately using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA). By calculating the singularity spectra $f(\alpha)$ we show that returns of both signs reveal multiscaling. Curiously, these spectra display a significant difference in the scaling properties of returns with opposite sign. The negative price changes are ruled by stronger temporal correlations than the positive ones, what is manifested by larger values of the corresponding H\""{o}lder exponents. As regards the properties of dominant trends, a bear market is more persistent than the bull market irrespective of the sign of fluctuations.",Human
A new analysis and new Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the measurements of the mobility $\mu_{i}$ of O$_{2}^{-} $ ions in dense supercritical Ar gas are reported. $\mu_{i}$ shows a marked dependence on the distance from the critical temperature $T_{c}.$ A mobility defect appears as a function of the gas density and its maximum value occurs below the critical density. The locus of points of maximum mobility defect in the $P-T$ plane appears on the extrapolation of the coexistence curve into the single-phase region. MD simulations quantitatively reproduce the mobility defect near $T_{c}.$,Human
"In recent work we presented a new approach to the analysis of weighted networks, by providing a straightforward generalization of any network measure defined on unweighted networks. This approach is based on the translation of a weighted network into an ensemble of edges, and is particularly suited to the analysis of fully connected weighted networks. Here we apply our method to several such networks including distance matrices, and show that the clustering coefficient, constructed by using the ensemble approach, provides meaningful insights into the systems studied. In the particular case of two data sets from microarray experiments the clustering coefficient identifies a number of biologically significant genes, outperforming existing identification approaches.",Human
"Plagiarism is a crime against academy. It deceives readers, hurts plagiarized authors, and gets the plagiarist undeserved benefits. However, even though these arguments do show that copying other people's intellectual contribution is wrong, they do not apply to the copying of words. Copying a few sentences that contain no original idea (e.g. in the introduction) is of marginal importance compared to stealing the ideas of others. The two must be clearly distinguished, and the 'plagiarism' label should not be used for deeds which are very different in nature and importance.

"Lagrangian studies of the local temperature mixing and heat transport in turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection are presented, based on three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. Contrary to vertical pair distances, the temporal growth of lateral pair distances agrees with the Richardson law, but yields a smaller Richardson constant due to correlated pair motion in plumes. Our results thus imply that Richardson dispersion is also found in anisotropic turbulence. We find that extremely large vertical accelerations appear less frequently than lateral ones and are not connected with rising or falling thermal plumes. The height-dependent joint Lagrangian statistics of vertical acceleration and local heat transfer allows us to identify a zone which is dominated by thermal plume mixing.",Human
"Dispersive Fourier transformation is a powerful technique in which spectral information is mapped into the time domain using chromatic dispersion. It replaces a spectrometer with an electronic digitizer, and enables real-time spectroscopy. The fundamental problem in this technique is the trade-off between the detection sensitivity and spectral resolution, a limitation set by the digitizer's bandwidth. This predicament is caused by the power loss associated with optical dispersion. We overcome this limitation using Raman amplified spectrum-to-time transformation. An extraordinary loss-less -11.76 ns/nm dispersive device is used to demonstrate single-shot gas absorption spectroscopy with 950 MHz resolution--a record in real-time spectroscopy.",Human
"The asymptotic closed-form solution to the fundamental diffraction problem of a linear horizontal Hertzian dipole radiating over the metallo-dielectric interface is provided. For observation points just above the interface, we confirm that the total surface near-field is the sum of two components: a long-range surface plasmon polariton and a short-range radiative cylindrical wave. The relative phases, amplitudes and damping functions of each component are quantitatively elucidated through simple analytic expressions for the entire range of propagation: near and asymptotic. Validation of the analytic solution is performed by comparing the predictions of a dipolar model with recently published data",Human
"Grooves were etched in a conductive layer of a conductive, transparent glass, and a nanoporous TiO2 film was deposited on both the conductive and nonconductive area. The width of the grooves was 100 $\mu$m and 150 $\mu$m. A transparent TiO2 film was dye-sensitized, covered with an electrolyte, and sandwiched with a cover glass. The conductivity of the dye-sensitized TiO2 film permeated with electrolyte was studied in the dark and under illumination, and was observed to be dependent on light intensity, wavelength and applied voltage. This study shows that dye-sensitized nanoporous films can be used as a wavelength dependent photoconductor.",Human
"The analysis of strong motion recordings in structures is crucial to understand the damaging process during earthquakes. A very precise time-frequency representation, the reassigned smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville method, allowed us to follow the variation of the Millikan Library (California) and the Grenoble City Hall building (France) resonance frequencies during earthquakes. Under strong motions, a quick frequency drop, attributed to damage of the soil-structure system, followed by a slower increase is found. However, in the case of weak earthquakes, we show that frequency variations come from the ground motion spectrum and cannot be interpreted in terms of change of the soil-structure system.",Human
"The wave function was proposed for description of quantum phenomena on the atomic level. But now it is well known that quantum phenomena are observed not only on atomic level and the wave function is used for description of macroscopic quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity. The essence of the wave function on level elementary particles was and is the subject of heated argument among founders of quantum mechanics and other physicists. This essence seems more clear in superconductor. But impossibility of probabilistic interpretation of wave function in this case results to obvious contradiction of quantum principles with some fundamental principles of physics.",Human
"We present an effective theory for the Bloch functions of a two-dimensional square lattice near a quadratic degeneracy point. The degeneracy is protected by the symmetries of the crystal, and breaking these symmetries can either open a bandgap or split the degeneracy into a pair of linear degeneracies that are continuable to Dirac points. A degeneracy of this type occurs between the second and third TM bands of a photonic crystal formed by a square lattice of dielectric rods. We show that the theory agrees with numerically computed photonic bandstructures, and discuss the resulting insight into the reflection-free edge modes induced by parity breaking.",Human
"We show the formation of bright and dark slow optical solitons based on intersubband transitions in a semiconductor quantum well (SQW). Using the coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell approach, we provide both analytical and numerical results. Such a nonlinear optical process may be used for the control technology of optical delay lines and optical buffers in the SQW solid-state system. With appropriate parameters, we also show the generation of a large cross-phase modulation (XPM). Since the the intersubband energy level can be easily tuned by an external bias voltage, the present investigation may open the possibility for electrically controlled phase modulator in the solid-state system.",Human
"A new algorithm for extracting de Haas-van Alphen frequencies and effective masses from calculated band energies is presented. The algorithm creates an interpolated k-space ""super cell,"" which is broken into slices perpendicular to the desired magnetic field direction. Fermi surface orbits are located within each slice, and de Haas-van Alphen frequencies and effective masses are calculated. Orbits are then matched across slices, and extremal orbits determined. This technique has been successful in locating extremal orbits not previously noticed in the complicated topology of existing UPt3 band-structure data; these new orbits agree with experimental de Haas-van Alphen measurements on this material, and solidify the case for a fully-itinerant model of UPt3.",Human
A theory describing above-threshold ionization of atoms and ions in a strong electromagnetic field is presented. It is based on the widely known strong field approximation and incorporates the Coulomb interaction between the photoelectron and the nucleus using the method of complex classical trajectories. A central result of the theory is the Coulomb-corrected ionization amplitude whose evaluation requires little extra numerical effort. By comparing our predictions with the results of ab initio numerical solutions for two examples we show that the new theory provides a significant improvement of the Coulomb-free strong field approximation. For the case of above-threshold ionization in elliptically polarized fields a comparison with available experimental data is also presented.,Human
"This paper proposes a radial dependent dispersive finite-difference time-domain method for the modelling of electromagnetic cloaking structures. The permittivity and permeability of the cloak are mapped to the Drude dispersion model and taken into account in dispersive FDTD simulations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that under ideal conditions, objects placed inside the cloak are `invisible' to external electromagnetic fields. However for the simplified cloak based on linear transformations, the back scattering has a similar level to the case of a PEC cylinder without any cloak, rendering the object still being `visible'. It is also demonstrated numerically that the simplified cloak based on high-order transformations can indeed improve the cloaking performance.",Human
"In recent years, two important techniques for geometric numerical discretization have been developed. In computational electromagnetics, spatial discretization has been improved by the use of mixed finite elements and discrete differential forms. Simultaneously, the dynamical systems and mechanics communities have developed structure-preserving time integrators, notably variational integrators that are constructed from a Lagrangian action principle. Here, we discuss how to combine these two frameworks to develop variational spacetime integrators for Maxwell's equations. Extending our previous work, which first introduced this variational perspective for Maxwell's equations without sources, we also show here how to incorporate free sources of charge and current.",Human
"Stochastic Resonance (SR) and Coherence Resonance (CR) have been studied experimentally in the discharge plasma close to a homoclinic bifurcation. For the SR phenomena, it is observed that a superimposed subthreshold periodic signal can be recovered via stochastic modulations of the discharge voltage. Furthermore, it is realized that even in the absence of a subthreshold deterministic signal, the system dynamics can be recovered and optimized using noise. This effect is defined as CR in the literature. In the present experiments, induction of SR and CR are quantified using the Absolute Mean Difference (AMD) and Normalized Variance (NV) techniques respectively. AMD is a new statistical tool to quantify regularity in the stochastic resonance and is independent of lag.",Human
"We extend the theory for laser cooling in a near-resonant optical lattice to include multiple excited hyperfine states. Simulations are performed treating the external degrees of freedom of the atom, i.e., position and momentum, classically, while the internal atomic states are treated quantum mechanically, allowing for arbitrary superpositions. Whereas theoretical treatments including only a single excited hyperfine state predict that the temperature should be a function of lattice depth only, except close to resonance, experiments have shown that the minimum temperature achieved depends also on the detuning from resonance of the lattice light. Our results resolve this discrepancy.",Human
We consider two-point non-self-adjoint boundary eigenvalue problems for linear matrix differential operators. The coefficient matrices in the differential expressions and the matrix boundary conditions are assumed to depend analytically on the complex spectral parameter and on the vector of real physical parameters. We study perturbations of semi-simple multiple eigenvalues as well as perturbations of non-derogatory eigenvalues under small variations of the parameters. Explicit formulae describing the bifurcation of the eigenvalues are derived. Application to the problem of excitation of unstable modes in rotating continua such as spherically symmetric MHD alpha2-dynamo and circular string demonstrates the efficiency and applicability of the theory.,Human
"Applying a modified version of the Gledzer-Ohkitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model, the signatures of so-called two-dimensionalization effect of three-dimensional incompressible, homogeneous, isotropic fully developed unforced turbulence have been studied and reproduced. Within the framework of shell models we have obtained the following results: (i) progressive steepening of the energy spectrum with increased strength of the rotation, and, (ii) depletion in the energy flux of the forward forward cascade, sometimes leading to an inverse cascade. The presence of extended self-similarity and self-similar PDFs for longitudinal velocity differences are also presented for the rotating 3D turbulence case.",Human
This paper discusses a simple theoretical throw model for frontal vehicle-pedestrian collisions. The model is based on the simple assumption that pedestrian movement after impact can be approximated by movement of a mass point. Two methods of reconstruction of vehicle-pedestrian collision are discussed: one knowing only the throw distance and the other when also impact to ground contact distance is known. The model is verified by field data available in the literature and by comportment with full scale numerical simulation.   This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to error in spreadsheet program which results in misleading results in verification section of the article.,Human
"We consider navigation or search schemes on networks which have a degree distribution of the form $P(k) \propto \exp(-k^\gamma)$. In addition, the linking probability is taken to be dependent on social distances and is governed by a parameter $\lambda$. The searches are realistic in the sense that not all search chains can be completed. An estimate of $\mu=\rho/s_d$, where $\rho$ is the success rate and $s_d$ the dynamic path length, shows that for a network of $N$ nodes, $\mu \propto N^{-\delta}$ in general. Dynamic small world effect, i.e., $\delta \simeq 0$ is shown to exist in a restricted region of the $\lambda-\gamma$ plane.",Human
"Modeling of headway/spacing between two consecutive vehicles has many applications in traffic flow theory and transport practice. Most known approaches only study the vehicles running on freeways. In this paper, we propose a model to explain the spacing distribution of queuing vehicles in front of a signalized junction based on random-matrix theory. We show that the recently measured spacing distribution data well fit the spacing distribution of a Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE). These results are also compared with the spacing distribution observed for car parking problem. Why vehicle-stationary-queuing and vehicle-parking have different spacing distributions (GSE vs GUE) seems to lie in the difference of driving patterns.",Human
"To provide a more accurate description of the driving behaviors in vehicle queues, a namely Markov-Gap cellular automata model is proposed in this paper. It views the variation of the gap between two consequent vehicles as a Markov process whose stationary distribution corresponds to the observed distribution of practical gaps. The multiformity of this Markov process provides the model enough flexibility to describe various driving behaviors. Two examples are given to show how to specialize it for different scenarios: usually mentioned flows on freeways and start-up flows at signalized intersections. The agreement between the empirical observations and the simulation results suggests the soundness of this new approach.",Human
"The letter considers non-isothermal fluid flows and revises simplifications of basic hydrodynamic equations for such flows arriving eventually to a generalization of the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation valid for arbitrary equation of state including both non-ideal gases as well as liquids. The proposed approach is based on a suggested general definition of potential temperature. Special attention is put on the energy conservation principle, and it is shown that the proposed approximation exactly preserves the total mechanical energy by approximate equations of motion. The principal importance for any turbulent boundary layer model to respect the conservation laws is emphasized explicitly.",Human
"We investigate the magnetic properties of nano-holes (NHs) patterned in graphene using first principles calculations. We show that superlattices consisting of a periodic array of NHs form a new family of 2D crystalline ""bulk"" magnets whose collective magnetic behavior is governed by inter-NH spin-spin interaction. They exhibit long-range magnetic order well above room temperature. Furthermore, magnetic semiconductors can be made by doping magnetic NHs into semiconducting NH superlattices. Our findings offer a new material system for fundamental studies of spin-spin interaction and magnetic ordering in low dimensions, and open up the exciting opportunities of making engineered magnetic materials for storage media and spintronics applications.",Human
"The dynamics of Vlasov kinetic moments is shown to be Lie-Poisson on the dual Lie algebra of symmetric contravariant tensor fields. The corresponding Lie bracket is identified with the symmetric Schouten bracket and the moment Lie algebra is related with a bundle of bosonic Fock spaces, where creation and annihilation operators are used to construct the cold plasma closure. Kinetic moments are also shown to define a momentum map, which is infinitesimally equivariant. This momentum map is the dual of a Lie algebra homomorphism, defined through the Schouten bracket. Finally the moment Lie-Poisson bracket is extended to anisotropic interactions.",Human
"Single crystals of pure and Cd2+ doped potassium sulfate were grown from aqueous solutions by the slow evaporation technique. From nutrient solutions with a CdSO4 concentration of 4wt.% crystals containing 0.014wt.% dopant concentration could be obtained. The X-ray diffraction patterns of powdered crystals confirmed their crystal structures for both cases. Thermal analysis of pure crystals shows that the alpha-beta phase transformation peak around 580 deg C is superimposed with spurious effects, while for Cd2+ doped crystals this is not the case. The thermal hysteresis of the phase transition is 8 K for undoped K2SO4 and is reduced to 3.5 K for K2SO4:Cd2+. Compared to undoped crystals, the optical transmittance of Cd2+ doped crystals is higher.",Human
"We derive a sufficient condition for the existence of index-guided modes in a very general class of dielectric waveguides, including photonic-crystal fibers (arbitrary periodic claddings, such as ``holey fibers''), anisotropic materials, and waveguides with periodicity along the propagation direction. This condition provides a rigorous guarantee of cutoff-free index-guided modes in any such structure where the core is formed by increasing the index of refraction (e.g. removing a hole). It also provides a weaker guarantee of guidance in cases where the refractive index is increased ``on average'' (precisely defined). The proof is based on a simple variational method, inspired by analogous proofs of localization for two-dimensional attractive potentials in quantum mechanics.",Human
"We propose a scheme in which entanglement can be transferred from atoms (discrete variables) to entangled states of cavity fields (continuous variables). The cavities play the role of a kind of quantum memory for entanglement, in such a way that it is possible to retrieve it back to the atoms. In our method, two three level atoms in a lambda configuration, previously entangled, are set to interact with single mode cavity fields prepared in coherent states. During the process, one e-bit of entanglement may be deposited in the cavities in an efficient way. We also show that the stored entanglement may be transferred back to flying atoms.",Human
"A compact, strictly all-fiber, picosecond pulse source based on ytterbium (Yb) doped fiber is described. Stable solitary mode-locking is obtained in a fiber-oscillator utilizing a carefully designed chirped fiber-Bragg-grating (C-FBG) for both dispersion control and spectral filtering. Self-starting is assured through the use of a fiber-coupled semiconductor-saturable-absorber-mirror (SESAM). The oscillator's 50MHz 3.8ps pulse-train output at 1064nm wavelength is amplified to 1.2W average power by an Yb doped fiber-amplifier, yielding 6.45ps parabolic pulses. Numerical simulations of the fiber oscillator design based on the modified nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE), agree well with the experimental results.",Human
"This paper reviews the scientific support for a ballistic pressure wave radiating outward from a penetrating projectile and causing injury and incapacitation. This phenomenon is known colloquially as ""hydrostatic shock."" The idea apparently originates with Col. Frank Chamberlin, a World War II trauma surgeon and wound ballistics researcher. The paper reviews claims that hydrostatic shock is a myth and considers supporting evidence through parallels with blast, describing the physics of the pressure wave, evidence for remote cerebral effects, and remote effects in the spine and other internal organs. Finally, the review considers the levels of energy transfer required for the phenomenon to be readily observed.",Human
"This paper presents a summary of seven distinct chains of evidence, which, taken together, provide compelling support for the theory that a ballistic pressure wave radiating outward from the penetrating projectile can contribute to wounding and incapacitating effects of handgun bullets. These chains of evidence include the fluid percussion model of traumatic brain injury, observations of remote ballistic pressure wave injury in animal models, observations of rapid incapacitation highly correlated with pressure magnitude in animal models, epidemiological data from human shootings showing that the probability of incapacitation increases with peak pressure magnitude, case studies in humans showing remote pressure wave damage in the brain and spinal cord, and observations of blast waves causing remote brain injury.",Human
"We propose a global symmetry-breaking mechanism based on an extension of the vibronic (cooperative Jahn-Teller) effects (comprising electron-phonon superpartners) to generalize them into fermion-boson superpartners. Examples of superpairs are constructed by combining phonons, photons, pi-mesons, etc. with electrons, holes, nucleons, etc. in condensed and nuclear matter. The obtained symmetry-breaking mechanism operating amidst the superpartner pairs may be just what is needed to justify the status of supersymmetry as a broken-symmetry phenomenon. Following the extended vibronic mixing of fermion states by the appropriate heavy boson superpartner, the latter propagates along a helical path away from the mixing site.",Human
"Recently in the authors' country Japan, the unpopularity of natural science among children has been a serious problem. Especially, physics is unpopular because physics requires mathematics. One of the reasons of this problem is that teachers themselves do not like physics. We focus our attention on the ``teachers in embryo'', namely the undergraduate students in a course for school teachers. We conducted a questionnaire and a quiz on the undergraduate students in the first grade of the Department of Science Education, Ibaraki University. We report the result of the questionnaire and the quiz, and also make suggestions to improve the present situation.",Human
"The nonlinear turbulent interactions between acoustic gravity waves are investigated using two dimensional nonlinear fluid simulations. The acoustic gravity waves consist of velocity and density perturbations and propagate across the density gradients in the vertical direction in the Earth's atmosphere. We find that the coupled two component model exhibits generation of large scale velocity potential flows along the vertical direction, while the density perturbations relax towards an isotropic random distribution. The characteristic turbulent spectrum associated with the system has a Kolmogorov-like feature and tends to relax towards a $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum, where $k$ is a typical wavenumber. The cross field diffusion associated with the velocity potential grows linearly and saturates in the nonlinear phase.",Human
"A linear theory of whistler wave is developed wihtin the paradigm of a two dimensional incompressible electron magnetohydrodynamics model. Exact analytic wave solutions are obtained for a small amplitude whistler wave that exhibit magnetic field topological structures consistent with the observations and our simulations in linear regime. In agreement with experiment, we find that the parallel group velocity of the wave is large compared to its perpendicular counterpart. Numerical simulations of collisional interactions demonstrate that the wave magnetic field either coalesces or repels depending upon the polarity of the associated current. In the nonlinear regime, our simulations demonstrate that the evolution of wave magnetic field is governed essentially by the nonlinear Hall force.",Human
"``The plasma approximation'' is, in the words of Pauli, ``not even wrong,'' as it expresses a disbelief in the symmetries of the underlying gauge field theory. The electrostatic field in question is divergenceful yet has no sources or sinks, thus breaking Lorentz covariance explicitly, and has no place in a self-consistent theory. Utilizing it leads to inconsistencies in the equation of motion and prevents a proper, field-theoretic treatment of condensed matter in the plasma state. By exposing the fallacy of replacing one of the field equations with one of the Bianchi identities, the applicability of Gauss' law to plasma physics is assured.",Human
"The mass symmetry between the two species in electron-positron (pair) plasmas has interesting consequences for collisionless magnetic reconnection because the Hall term, which plays a crucial role in supporting fast reconnection in electron-proton plasmas, vanishes. We perform kinetic simulations of pair reconnection in systems of various sizes, show that it remains fast, and identify the reason why this occurs. For sufficiently large systems a Weibel-like temperature anisotropy instability develops in the outflow from the X-point that causes the current layer to broaden and form a Petschek-like open outflow. We discuss the parameter regimes in which pair reconnection should be fast and the implications for astrophysical pair plasmas.",Human
"Web sites where users create and rate content as well as form networks with other users display long-tailed distributions in many aspects of behavior. Using behavior on one such community site, Essembly, we propose and evaluate plausible mechanisms to explain these behaviors. Unlike purely descriptive models, these mechanisms rely on user behaviors based on information available locally to each user. For Essembly, we find the long-tails arise from large differences among user activity rates and qualities of the rated content, as well as the extensive variability in the time users devote to the site. We show that the models not only explain overall behavior but also allow estimating the quality of content from their early behaviors.",Human
"The generation of muon-antimuon pairs is calculated in the collision of an ultrarelativistic bare ion with an intense x-ray laser beam. The reaction proceeds nonlinearly via absorption of two laser photons. By systematic study throughout the nuclear chart we show that the interplay between the nuclear charge and size, along with the possibility of nuclear excitation leads to saturation of the total production rates for high-Z ions, in contrast to the usual Z^2 scaling for pointlike projectiles. The process is experimentally accessible by combining present-day ion accelerators with near-future laser sources and in principle allows for the measurement of nuclear form factors.",Human
"The big bang hypothesis is widely accepted despite numerous physics conflicts. It rests upon two experimental supports, galactic red shift and the cosmic microwave background. Both are produced by dark matter, shown here to be hydrogen dominated aggregates with a few percent of helium nodules. Scattering from these non-radiating intergalactic masses produce a red shift that normally correlates with distance. Warmed by our galaxy to an Eigenvalue of 2.735 K, drawn near the Earth, these bodies, kept cold by ablation, resonance radiate the Planckian microwave signal. Several tests are proposed that will distinguish between this model and the big bang.",Human
"In this paper we describe a method for evolving the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (PGPE) for a Bose gas in a harmonic oscillator potential. The central difficulty in solving this equation is the requirement that the classical field is restricted to a small set of prescribed modes that constitute the low energy classical region of the system. We present a scheme, using a Hermite-polynomial based spectral representation, that precisely implements this mode restriction and allows an efficient and accurate solution of the PGPE. We show equilibrium and non-equilibrium results from the application of the PGPE to an anisotropic trapped three-dimensional Bose gas.",Human
"We have performed full-relativistic density functional theory calculations to study the geometry and binding energy of different isomers of free platinum clusters Pt$_{n}$ ($n=4-6$) within the spin multiplicities from singlet to nonet. The spin-orbit coupling effect has been discussed for the minimum-energy structures, relative stabilities, vibrational frequencies, magnetic moments, and the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular-orbital gaps. It is found in contrast to some of the previous calculations that 3-dimentional configurations are still lowest energy structures of these clusters, although spin-orbit effect makes some planar or quasi-planar geometries more stable than some other 3-dimentional isomers.",Human
"Typical arguments against scientific misconduct generally fail to support current policies on research fraud: they may not prove wrong what is usually considered research misconduct and they tend to make wrong things that are not normally seen as scientific fraud, in particular honest errors. I also point out that sanctions are not consistent with the reasons why scientific fraud is supposed to be wrong either. Moreover honestly seeking truth should not be contrived as a moral rule -- it is instead a necessary condition for work to qualify as scientific.

"We present a new molecular dynamics algorithm for sampling the canonical distribution. In this approach the velocities of all the particles are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling. We illustrate the properties of this new method on Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its performance is excellent and largely independent on the thermostat parameter also with regard to the dynamic properties.",Human
Evolutionary games are studied where the teaching activity of players can evolve in time. Initially all players following either the cooperative or defecting strategy are distributed on a square lattice. The rate of strategy adoption is determined by the payoff difference and a teaching activity characterizing the donor's capability to enforce its strategy on the opponent. Each successful strategy adoption process is accompanied with an increase in the donor's teaching activity. By applying an optimum value of the increment this simple mechanism spontaneously creates relevant inhomogeneities in the teaching activities that support the maintenance of cooperation for both the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game.,Human
"As shown by Ganan-Calvo and co-workers, a free liquid jet can be compressed in iameter through gas-dynamic forces exerted by a co-flowing gas, obviating the need for a solid nozzle to form a microscopic liquid jet and thereby alleviating the clogging problems that plague conventional droplet sources of small diameter. We describe in this paper a novel form of droplet beam source based on this principle. The source is miniature, robust, dependable, easily fabricated, and eminently suitable for delivery of microscopic liquid droplets, including hydrated biological samples, into vacuum for analysis using vacuum instrumentation. Monodisperse, single file droplet streams are generated by triggering the device with a piezoelectric actuator. The device is essentially immune to clogging.",Human
"It is widely agreed that exams must be fair; yet what this exactly means is not made clear. One may mean fairness of treatment, but this merely propagates the fairness or unfairness of pre-existing rules. Fairness of opportunity on the other hand necessarily leads to identical grades for everyone, which clearly makes it inapplicable. Neither view is helpful to make decisions on competing claims: fairness of treatment ignores the problem and fairness of opportunity holds all claims to be equally valid. To escape this deadlock one needs an external criterion to replace fairness viewed as student-student comparison.

"Till the late nineties the accepted cosmological model was that of a Universe that had originated in the Big Bang and was now decelerating under the influence of as yet undetected dark matter, so that it would come to a halt and eventually collapse. In 1997 however, the author had put forward a contra model wherein the Universe was driven by dark energy, essentially the quantum zero point field, and was accelerating with a small cosmological constant. There were other deductions too, all in total agreement with observation. All this got confirmation in 1998 and subsequent observations have reconfirmed the findings.",Human
"We have developed a time-dependent three-dimensional model of isotropic, adiabatic, and compressible magnetohydrodynamic plasma to understand nonlinear cascades of density fluctuations in local interstellar medium. Our simulations, describing evolution of initial supersonic, super Alfv\'enic plasma modes, indicate that nonlinear interactions lead to damping of plasma motion. During the process, turbulent cascades are governed predominantly by the Alfv\'enic modes and velocity field fluctuations evolve towards a state charachterized by near incompressibility. Consequently, density field is advected passively by the velocity field. Our findings thus demonstrate that the observed density fluctuations in the interstellar medium are the structures passively convected by the background velocity field.",Human
The study of dynamo action in astrophysical objects classically involves two timescales: the slow diffusive one and the fast advective one. We investigate the possibility of field amplification on an intermediate timescale associated with time dependent modulations of the flow. We consider a simple steady configuration for which dynamo action is not realised. We study the effect of time dependent perturbations of the flow. We show that some vanishing low frequency perturbations can yield exponential growth of the magnetic field on the typical time scale of oscillation. The dynamo mechanism relies here on a parametric instability associated with transient amplification by shear flows. Consequences on natural dynamos are discussed.,Human
"We report on the experimental demonstration of a tunable monolithic optical frequency comb generator. The device is based on the four-wave mixing in a crystalline calcium fluoride whispering gallery mode resonator. The frequency spacing of the comb is given by an integer number of the free spectral range of the resonator. We select the desired number by tuning the pumping laser frequency with respect to the corresponding resonator mode. We also observe interacting optical combs and high-frequency hyperparametric oscillation, depending on the experimental conditions. A potential application of the comb for generating narrowband frequency microwave signals is demonstrated.",Human
"We measure and theoretically determine the effect of molecular rotational splitting on Zeeman relaxation rates in collisions of cold Triplet-Sigma molecules with helium atoms in a magnetic field. All four stable isotopomers of the imidogen (NH) molecule are magnetically trapped and studied in collisions with 3He and 4He. The 4He data support the predicted inverse square dependence of the collision induced Zeeman relaxation rate coefficient on the molecular rotational constant B. The measured 3He rate coefficients are much larger than 4He and depend less strongly on B, and the theoretical analysis indicates they are strongly affected by a shape resonance. The results demonstrate the influence of molecular structure on collisional energy transfer at low temperatures.",Human
"A method is presented for determining the initial conditions of classical orbits from the quantum spectra of the diamagnetic hydrogen atom. Each classical trajectory which is closed at the nucleus produces a sinusoidal fluctuation in the photoabsorption spectrum. The amplitude of each orbit's contribution appears in the Fourier transform of a spectrum computed at constant scaled energy. For a given initial state, closed-orbit theory gives the dependence of this recurrence amplitude on the initial angle of an orbit. By comparing the recurrence amplitudes for different initial states, the initial conditions of closed classical orbits are determined from quantum spectra.",Human
"Data series generated by complex systems exhibit fluctuations on many time scales and/or broad distributions of the values. In both equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations, the natural fluctuations are often found to follow a scaling relation over several orders of magnitude, allowing for a characterisation of the data and the generating complex system by fractal (or multifractal) scaling exponents. In addition, fractal and multifractal approaches can be used for modelling time series and deriving predictions regarding extreme events. This review article describes and exemplifies several methods originating from Statistical Physics and Applied Mathematics, which have been used for fractal and multifractal time series analysis.",Human
"This chapter reviews the mechanisms by which sensors gather information from the physical world and transform it into the electronic signals that are used in today's information and control systems. It introduces a new methodology for describing sensing mechanisms based on the process of information flow and applies it to the broad spectrum of sensors, instruments and data input devices in current use. We identify four distinct elemental transduction processes: energy conversion, energy dispersion, energy modulation and modulation of a material property. We posit that these four mechanisms form a complete set for describing information transduction in sensing systems.",Human
"We measure the expansion of an ultracold plasma across the field lines of a uniform magnetic field. We image the ion distribution by extracting the ions with a high voltage pulse onto a position-sensitive detector. Early in the lifetime of the plasma ($< 20$ $\mu$s), the size of the image is dominated by the time-of-flight Coulomb explosion of the dense ion cloud. For later times, we measure the 2-D Gaussian width of the ion image, obtaining the transverse expansion velocity as a function of magnetic field (up to 70 G). We observe that the expansion velocity scales as B$^{-1/2}$, explained by a nonlinear ambipolar diffusion model with anisotropic diffusion in two different directions.",Human
"Dynamin is a ubiquitous GTPase that tubulates lipid bilayers and is implicated in many membrane severing processes in eukaryotic cells. Setting the grounds for a better understanding of this biological function, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics description of the conformational change of large dynamin-membrane tubes taking into account GTP consumption as a free energy source. On observable time scales, dissipation is dominated by an effective dynamin/membrane friction and the deformation field of the tube has a simple diffusive behavior, which could be tested experimentally. A more involved, semi-microscopic model yields complete predictions for the dynamics of the tube and possibly accounts for contradictory experimental results concerning its change of conformation as well as for plectonemic supercoiling.",Human
We investigate nuclear-resonant electron scattering as occurring in the two-step process of nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) followed by internal conversion. The nuclear excitation and decay are treated by a phenomenological collective model in which nuclear states and transition probabilities are described by experimental parameters. We present capture rates and resonant strengths for a number of heavy ion collision systems considering various scenarios for the resonant electron scattering process. The results show that for certain cases resonant electron scattering can have significantly larger resonance strengths than NEEC followed by the radiative decay of the nucleus. We discuss the impact of our findings on the possible experimental observation of NEEC.,Human
"We predict that two electron beams can develop an instability when passing through a slab of left-handed media (LHM). This instability, which is inherent only for LHM, originates from the backward Cherenkov radiation and results in a self-modulation of the beams and radiation of electromagnetic waves. These waves leave the sample via the rear surface of the slab (the beam injection plane) and form two shifted bright circles centered at the beams. A simulated spectrum of radiation has well-separated lines on top of a broad continuous spectrum, which indicates dynamical chaos in the system. The radiation intensity and its spectrum can be controlled either by the beams' current or by the distance between the two beams.",Human
"{\it Transcription} is the process whereby RNA molecules are polymerized by molecular machines, called RNA polymerase (RNAP), using the corresponding DNA as the template. Recent {\it in-vivo} experiments with single cells have established that transcription takes place in ""bursts"" or ""pulses"". In this letter we present a model that captures not only the mechano-chemistry of individual RNAPs and their steric interactions but also the switching of the gene between the ON and OFF states. This model accounts for the statistical properties of the transcriptional bursts. It also shows how the quantitative features of the distributions of these bursts can be tuned by controlling the appropriate steps of operation of the RNAP machines.",Human
"The temperatures in different zones in the world do not show significant changes due to El-Nino except when measured in a restricted area in the Pacific Ocean. We find, in contrast, that the dynamics of a climate network based on the same temperature records in various geographical zones in the world is significantly influenced by El-Nino. During El-Nino many links of the network are broken, and the number of surviving links comprises a specific and sensitive measure for El-Nino events. While during non El-Nino periods these links which represent correlations between temperatures in different sites are more stable, fast fluctuations of the correlations observed during El-Nino periods cause the links to break.",Human
"We describe RAGE, the ``Radiation Adaptive Grid Eulerian'' radiation-hydrodynamics code, including its data structures, its parallelization strategy and performance, its hydrodynamic algorithm(s), its (gray) radiation diffusion algorithm, and some of the considerable amount of verification and validation efforts. The hydrodynamics is a basic Godunov solver, to which we have made significant improvements to increase the advection algorithm's robustness and to converge stiffnesses in the equation of state. Similarly, the radiation transport is a basic gray diffusion, but our treatment of the radiation-material coupling, wherein we converge nonlinearities in a novel manner to allow larger timesteps and more robust behavior, can be applied to any multi-group transport algorithm.",Human
"In 2007 an international conference engaged a reflection on the present conditions for sciences and scientific practice, to initiate a dialogue between science, philosophy, epistemology and sociology. Starting from many examples taken from the history of sciences and the present status of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics, I analyze various issues such as the possible limits of theoretical and technological advances, the paradox of non-verifiability in string theory, incompleteness, the role of imagination in scientific research along with educational aspects, the epistemological value of the Ockham's razor principle for constraining theories, and our undersanding of man's place in Creation.",Human
"We present the key results from a comprehensive study of the refraction and focusing properties of a two-dimensional dodecagonal photonic ``quasicrystal'' (PQC), carried out via both full-wave numerical simulations and microwave measurements on a slab made of alumina rods inserted in a parallel-plate waveguide. We observe anomalous refraction and focusing in several frequency regions, confirming some recently published results. However, our interpretation, based on numerical and experimental evidence, differs substantially from the one in terms of ``effective negative refractive-index'' that was originally proposed. Instead, our study highlights the critical role played by short-range interactions associated with local order and symmetry.",Human
"At the exit surface of a photonic crystal, the intensity of the diffracted wave can be periodically modulated, showing a maximum in the ""positive"" (forward diffracted) or in the ""negative"" (diffracted) direction, depending on the slab thickness. This thickness dependence is a direct result of the so-called Pendellosung phenomenon, consisting of the periodic exchange inside the crystal of the energy between direct and diffracted beams. We report the experimental observation of this effect in the microwave region at about 14 GHz by irradiating 2D photonic crystal slabs of different thickness and detecting the intensity distribution of the electromagnetic field at the exit surface and inside the crystal itself.",Human
"When moving from native to light activated bacteriorhodopsin, modification of charge transport consisting of an increase of conductance is correlated to the protein conformational change. A theoretical model based on a map of the protein tertiary structure into a resistor network is implemented to account for a sequential tunneling mechanism of charge transfer through neighbouring amino acids. The model is validated by comparison with current-voltage experiments. The predictability of the model is further tested on bovine rhodopsin, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) also sensitive to light. In this case, results show an opposite behaviour with a decrease of conductance in the presence of light.",Human
"In the present discussion Background Independent framework of Quantum Mechanics and its possible implications in the studies of gravity and Physics at short distance are addressed. The expression of the metric of quantum state space $g_{\mu\nu}$ which is intrinsically a quantized quantity, is identified in terms of Compton wavelength as: $[<\partial_\mu\psi\mid\partial_\nu\psi> - <\partial_\mu\psi\mid\psi> <\psi\mid\partial_\nu\psi>] = 1 / \lambdabar_C^2 (=m_0^2c^2 / \hbar^2})$. The discussion also sheds light on the notion of neighborhood in quantum evolution, and various constraints on the possibilities of smallness of distance in the quantum mechanical limits.",Human
"It is proposed to levitate a conducting sphere in a high pressure Taylor flow and to charge it up to gigavolt potentials, either mechanically as in a Van de Graaff electrostatic generator, or inductively by a rising magnetic field. If the Taylor flow is sufficiently fast, it should overcome the electric pressure and breakdown by stepped leader formation, leading to the maximum attainable voltage by the Paschen law. Discharging the electrostatically stored energy can be done by controlled breakdown. With gigajoule energies stored and released in about 10^-8 sec, this implies and electric pulse power of the order 10^17 Watt, opening the prospect of large driver energies for thermonuclear ignition.",Human
"Pt deposited onto a Ge(001) surface gives rise to the spontaneous formation of atomic nanowires on a mixed Pt-Ge surface after high temperature annealing. We study possible structures of the mixed surface and the nanowires by total energy (density functional theory) calculations. Experimental scanning tunneling microscopy images are compared to the calculated local densities of states. On the basis of this comparison and the stability of the structures, we conclude that the formation of nanowires is driven by an increased concentration of Pt atoms in the Ge surface layers. Surprisingly, the atomic nanowires consist of Ge instead of Pt atoms.",Human
"Bose-Einstein condensate of rarified atomic gases is considered as the state formed by exchange of virtual photons, resonant to the lowest levels of atoms; such representation corresponds to the Einstein opinion about an inter-influence of condensable particles. Considered interactions directly lead to the QED structure of nonlinear potential in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Linear momenta that correspond to the thermal energy of condensable atoms are connected to near field of particles and therefore leave atoms immovable. The estimations of these effects do not contradict the observed data; the general quantum principles predict possibility of stimulating of BEC formation by resonant irradiation. All this requires the spectroscopic investigation of BEC on different steps of formation.",Human
"We report the first observation of the dependence of the coherent-backscattering (CBS) enhanced cone with the frequency of the backscattered photon. The experiment is performed on a diffusing liquid suspension and the Doppler broadening of light is induced by the Brownian motion of the scatterers. Heterodyne detection on a CCD camera is used to measure the complex field (i.e., the hologram) of the light that is backscattered at a given frequency. The analysis of the holograms yield the frequency and the propagation direction of the backscattered photons. We observe that the angular CBS cone becomes more narrow in the tail of the Brownian spectrum. The experimental results are in good agreement with a simple theoretical model.",Human
Multipolar plasmon oscillation frequencies and corresponding damping rates for nanospheres formed of the simplest free-electron metals are studied. The possibility of controlling plasmon features by choosing the size and dielectric properties of the sphere surroundings is discussed. Optical properties of the studied metals are described within the Drude-Sommerfeld model of the dielectric function with effective parameters acounting for the contribution of conduction electrons and of interband transitions. No approximation is made in respect of the size of a particle; plasmon size characteristics are described rigorously. The results of our experiment on sodium nanodroplets [1] are compared with the oscillation frequency size dependence of dipole and quadrupole plasmon.,Human
"We study the two dimensional (2D) stochastic Navier Stokes (SNS) equations in the inertial limit of weak forcing and dissipation. The stationary measure is concentrated close to steady solutions of the 2D Euler equation. For such inertial flows, we prove that bifurcations in the flow topology occur either by changing the domain shape, the nonlinearity of the vorticity-stream function relation, or the energy. Associated to this, we observe in SNS bistable behavior with random changes from dipoles to unidirectional flows. The theoretical explanation being very general, we infer the existence of similar phenomena in experiments and in models of geophysical flows.",Human
"We report a new technique to determine the van der Waals coeffcients of lithium (Li) atoms based on the relativistic coupled-cluster theory. These quantities are determined using the imaginary parts of the scalar dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities, which are evaluated using the approach that we have proposed in [1]. Our procedure is fully ab initio, and avoids the sum-over-the-states method. We present the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities of many of the low-lying excited states of Li. Also, the off-diagonal dipole and quadrupole polarizabilites between some of the low-lying states of Li are calculated.",Human
"Recently, the bond lengths of the molecular components of nucleic acids and of caffeine and related molecules were shown to be sums of the appropriate covalent radii of the adjacent atoms. Thus, each atom was shown to have its specific contribution to the bond length. This enabled establishing their atomic structures for the first time. In this work, the known bond lengths for amino acids and the peptide bond are similarly shown to be sums of the atomic covalent radii. Based on this result, the atomic structures of all the twenty essential amino acids and a tripeptide have been presented.",Human
"Recently, by analyzing the measurement data of Nikuradze, it has been proposed (N. Goldenfeld, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{96}}, 044503, 2006) that the friction factor, $f$, of rough pipe flow obeys a scaling law in the turbulent regime. Here, we provide a phenomenological scaling argument to explain this law and demonstrate how intermittency modifies the scaling form, thereby relating $f$ to the intermittency exponent, $\eta$. By statistically analyzing the measurement data of $f$, we infer a satisfactory estimate for $\eta$ ($\approx 0.02$), the inclusion of which is shown to improve the data-collapse curve. This provides empirical evidence for intermittency other than the direct measurement of velocity fluctuations.",Human
"Neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet powders (Nd:YAG or (Y{1-x}Nd{x})3Al5O12, x=0.15, 0.25, or 0.30, respectively) were prepared by a sol-gel technique. By DTA measurements up to 2000 deg C eutectic and liquidus temperatures could be determined. Exothermal peaks in the second and subsequent DTA heating runs indicate that the crystallized DTA samples are not in equilibrium. The section Y3Al5O12-Nd3Al5O12 of the concentration triangle Al2O3-Nd2O3-Y2O3 is proposed on the basis of thermodynamic calculations that allows to explain the experimental results by the balance of metastable phase states in the previously crystallized DTA samples.",Human
"Rigorous electromagnetic field simulations are an essential part for scatterometry and mask pattern design. Today mainly periodic structures are considered in simulations. Non-periodic structures are typically modeled by large, artificially periodified computational domains. For systems with a large radius of influence this leads to very large computational domains to keep the error sufficiently small. In this paper we review recent advances in the rigorous simulation of isolated structures embedded into a surrounding media. We especially address the situation of a layered surrounding media (mask or wafer) with additional infinite inhomogeneities such as resist lines. Further we detail how to extract the far field information needed for the aerial image computation in the non-periodic setting.",Human
"Phase-Rectified Signal Averaging (PRSA) was shown to be a powerful tool for the study of quasi-periodic oscillations and nonlinear effects in non-stationary signals. Here we present a bivariate PRSA technique for the study of the inter-relationship between two simultaneous data recordings. Its performance is compared with traditional cross-correlation analysis, which, however, does not work well for non-stationary data and cannot distinguish the coupling directions in complex nonlinear situations. We show that bivariate PRSA allows the analysis of events in one signal at times where the other signal is in a certain phase or state; it is stable in the presence of noise and impassible to non-stationarities.",Human
"The effect of non periodic boundary conditions on decaying two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is investigated. We consider a circular domain with no-slip boundary conditions for the velocity and where the normal component of the magnetic field vanishes at the wall. Different flow regimes are obtained by starting from random initial velocity and magnetic fields with varying integral quantities. These regimes, equivalent to the ones observed by Ting, Matthaeus and Montgomery [Phys. Fluids {\bf 29}, 3261, (1986)] in periodic domains, are found to subsist in confined domains. We examine the effect of solid boundaries on the energy decay and alignment properties. The final states are characterized by functional relationships between velocity and magnetic field.",Human
"In a range of physical systems, the first instability in Rayleigh-Bernard convection between nearly thermally insulating horizontal plates is large scale. This holds for thermal convection of fluids saturating porous media. Large-scale thermal convection in a horizontal layer is governed by remarkably similar equations both in the presence of a porous matrix and without it, with only one additional term for the latter case, which, however, vanishes under certain conditions (e.g., two-dimensional flows or infinite Prandtl number). We provide a rigorous derivation of long-wavelength equations for a porous layer with inhomogeneous heating and possible pumping.",Human
"We explore the extended framework of the generalized quantum mechanics and discuss various aspects of neighborhood in the construction of space in search of origin of cosmological constant. We propose to expand definition of the volume of the phase space in eight dimensions with an overall constraint in the form of uncertainty relation as: $(\Delta p_{x}\Delta p_{y}\Delta p_{z}\Delta E)(\Delta x\Delta y\Delta z\Delta t)\sim h^{4}$. We argue that the phase space volume in the eight dimensions is an appropriate representation that it should be, and the relation $(\Delta \Lambda)(\Delta V)\sim h$ again brings it down to the reduced phase space.",Human
"We describe the electronic control of extraordinary terahertz transmission through subwavelength metal hole arrays fabricated on doped semiconductor substrates. The hybrid metal-semiconductor forms a Schottky diode structure, where the active depletion region modifies the substrate conductivity in real-time by applying an external voltage bias. This enables effective control of the resonance enhanced terahertz transmission. Our proof of principle device achieves an intensity modulation depth of 52% by changing the voltage bias between 0 and 16 volts. Further optimization may result in improvement of device performance and practical applications. This approach can be also translated to the other optical frequency ranges.",Human
In this work we present new second order semi-discrete central schemes for systems of hyperbolic conservation laws on curvilinear grids. Our methods generalise the two-dimensional central-upwind schemes developed by Kurganov and Tadmor. In these schemes we account for area and volume changes in the numerical flux functions due to the non-cartesian geometries. In case of vectorial conservation laws we introduce a general prescription of the geometrical source terms valid for various orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems. The methods are applied to the two-dimensional Euler equations of inviscid gas dynamics with and without angular momentum transport. In the latter case we introduce a new test problem to examine the detailed conservation of specific angular momentum.,Human
"A calculation of the current-quark-mass-dependence of nucleon static electromagnetic properties is necessary in order to use observational data as a means to place constraints on the variation of Nature's fundamental parameters. A Poincare' covariant Faddeev equation, which describes baryons as composites of confined-quarks and -nonpointlike-diquarks, is used to calculate this dependence The results indicate that, like observables dependent on the nucleons' magnetic moments, quantities sensitive to their magnetic and charge radii, such as the energy levels and transition frequencies in Hydrogen and Deuterium, might also provide a tool with which to place limits on the allowed variation in Nature's constants.",Human
"The mutual influence of dynamics and structure is a central issue in complex systems. In this paper we study by simulation slow evolution of network under the feedback of a local-majority-rule opinion process. If performance-enhancing local mutations have higher chances of getting integrated into its structure, the system can evolve into a highly heterogeneous small-world with a global hub (whose connectivity is proportional to the network size), strong local connection correlations and power law-like degree distribution. Networks with better dynamical performance are achieved if structural evolution occurs much slower than the network dynamics. Structural heterogeneity of many biological and social dynamical systems may also be driven by various dynamics-structure coupling mechanisms.",Human
"Conventional kinesin is a motor protein, which is able to walk along a microtubule processively. The exact mechanism of the stepping motion and force generation of kinesin is still far from clear. In this paper we argue that neck linker docking is a crucial element of this mechanism, without which the experimentally observed dwell times of the steps could not be explained under a wide range of loading forces. We also show that the experimental data impose very strict constraints on the lengths of both the neck linker and its docking section, which are compatible with the known structure of kinesin.",Human
"We investigate the crystallization rate of a one-component plasma (OCP) in the context of classical nucleation theory. From our derivation of the free energy of an arbitrary distribution of solid clusters embedded in a liquid phase, we derive the steady-state nucleation rate of an OCP as a function of the Coulomb coupling parameter. Our result for the rate is in accord with recent molecular dynamics simulations, but it is greater than that of previous analytical estimates by many orders of magnitude. Further molecular dynamics simulations of the nucleation rate of a supercooled liquid OCP for several values of the coupling parameter would clarify the physics of this process.",Human
"We address the problem of multiresolution module detection in dense weighted networks, where the modular structure is encoded in the weights rather than topology. We discuss a weighted version of the q-state Potts method, which was originally introduced by Reichardt and Bornholdt. This weighted method can be directly applied to dense networks. We discuss the dependence of the resolution of the method on its tuning parameter and network properties, using sparse and dense weighted networks with built-in modules as example cases. Finally, we apply the method to data on stock price correlations, and show that the resulting modules correspond well to known structural properties of this correlation network.",Human
"The scaling relation derived by Dorogovtsev, Goltsev, Mendes and Samukhin [Phys. Rev. E, 68 (2003) 046109] states that the exponents of the power-law connectivity distribution, gamma, and the power-law eigenvalue distribution of the adjacency matrix, delta, of a locally treelike scale-free network satisfy 2*gamma - delta = 1 in the mean field approximation. Here, it is shown that this relation holds well for the reduced simple earthquake networks (without tadpole-loops and multiple edges) constructed from the seismic data taken from California and Japan. The result is interpreted from the viewpoint of the hierarchical organization of the earthquake networks.",Human
"We analyzed the energy and momentum distributions of laser-induced high-energy photoelectrons of alkali and rare gas atoms. For the plateau electrons with energies above $4U_p$, ($U_p$ is the ponderomotive energy), in the tunneling ionization regime, we showed that they originate from the backscattering of laser-induced returning electrons. Using the differential elastic scattering cross sections between the target ion with \emph{free} electrons, we explain experimental observations of whether the plateau electron spectra is flat or steeply descending, and their dependence on species and laser intensity. This quantitative rescattering theory can be used to obtain energy and momentum distributions of plateau electrons without the need of solving the time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation, but with similar accuracy.",Human
"In order to reduce the difficulties in the experimental realizations of the cloak but still keep good performance of invisibility, we proposed a perfect cylindrical invisibility cloak with spatially invariant axial material parameters. The advantage of this kind of TE (or TM) cloak is that only rho and phi components of mu (or epsilon) are spatially variant, which makes it possible to realize perfect invisibility with two-dimensional (2D) magnetic (or electric) metamaterials. The effects of perturbations of the parameters on the performance of this cloak are quantitatively analyzed by scattering theory. Our work provides a simple and feasible solution to the experimental realization of cloaks with ideal parameters.",Human
The fully three dimensional governing equations in the electron magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) regime for a plasma with inhomogeneous density is obtained. These equations in the two dimensional (2-D) limit can be cast in terms of the evolution of two coupled scalar fields. The nonlinear simulations for the two dimensional case are carried out to understand the propagation of EMHD magnetic structures in the presence of inhomogeneity. A novel effect related to trapping of dipolar magnetic structures in the high density plasma region in the EMHD regime is observed. The interpretation of this phenomena as well as its relevance to the problem of hot spot generation in the context of fast ignition is presented.,Human
"We analyze the resonant transmission of light through a photonic-crystal waveguide side coupled to a Kerr nonlinear cavity, and demonstrate how to design the structure geometry for achieving bistability and all-optical switching at ultra-low powers in the slow-light regime. We show that the resonance quality factor in such structures scales inversely proportional to the group velocity of light at the resonant frequency and thus grows indefinitely in the slow-light regime. Accordingly, the power threshold required for all-optical switching in such structures scales as a square of the group velocity, rapidly vanishing in the slow-light regime.",Human
"The effect of disorder in the energetic heights and in the physical locations of fence barriers encountered by transmembrane molecules such as proteins and lipids in their motion in cell membranes is studied theoretically. The investigation takes as its starting point a recent analysis of a periodic system with constant distances between barriers and constant values of barrier heights, and employs effective medium theory to treat the disorder. The calculations make possible, in principle, the extraction of confinement parameters such as mean compartment sizes and mean intercompartmental transition rates from experimentally reported published observations. The analysis should be helpful both as an unusual application of effective medium theory and as an investigation of observed molecular movements in cell membranes.",Human
"We perform calculations for the neutron skin of nuclei and its contribution to atomic parity non-conservation (PNC) in many isotopes of Cs, Ba, Sm, Dy, Yb, Tl, Pb, Bi, Fr, Ra. Three problems are addressed: i) Neutron-skin induced errors to single-isotope PNC, ii) Possibility to measure neutron skin using atomic PNC, iii) Neutron-skin induced errors for ratios of PNC effects in different isotopes. In the latter case the correlations in the neutron skin values for different isotopes lead to cancelations of the errors; this makes the isotopic ratio method a competitive tool in a search for new physics beyond the standard model.",Human
"Ultra-cold atoms can be manipulated using microfabricated devices known as atom chips. These have significant potential for applications in sensing, metrology and quantum information processing. To date, the chips are loaded by transfer of atoms from an external, macroscopic magneto-optical trap (MOT) into microscopic traps on the chip. This transfer involves a series of steps, which complicate the experimental procedure and lead to atom losses. In this paper we present a design for integrating a MOT into a silicon wafer by combining a concave pyramidal mirror with a square wire loop. We describe how an array of such traps has been fabricated and we present magnetic, thermal and optical properties of the chip.",Human
"We present and analyze results of the relativistic coupled-cluster calculation of energies, hyperfine constants, and dipole matrix elements for the $2s$, $2p_{1/2}$, and $2p_{3/2}$ states of Li atom. The calculations are complete through the fourth order of many-body perturbation theory for energies and through the fifth order for matrix elements and subsume certain chains of diagrams in all orders. A nearly complete many-body calculation allows us to draw conclusions on the convergence pattern of the coupled-cluster method. Our analysis suggests that the high-order many-body contributions to energies and matrix elements scale proportionally and provides a quantitative ground for semi-empirical fits of {\em ab inito} matrix elements to experimental energies.",Human
Proliferating cell populations at steady state growth often exhibit broad protein distributions with exponential tails. The sources of this variation and its universality are of much theoretical interest. Here we address the problem by asymptotic analysis of the Population Balance Equation. We show that the steady state distribution tail is determined by a combination of protein production and cell division and is insensitive to other model details. Under general conditions this tail is exponential with a dependence on parameters consistent with experiment. We discuss the conditions for this effect to be dominant over other sources of variation and the relation to experiments.,Human
"We examine the effects of a linearly polarized nonresonant radiative field on the dynamics of rotationally inelastic $\text{Na}^{+} + \text{N}_2$ collisions at eV collision energies. Our treatment is based on the Fraunhofer model of matter wave scattering and its recent extension to collisions in electric fields [arXiv:0804.3318v1]. The nonresonant radiative field changes the effective shape of the target molecule by aligning it in the space-fixed frame. This markedly alters the differential and integral scattering cross sections. As the cross sections can be evaluated for a polarization of the radiative field collinear or perpendicular to the relative velocity vector, the model also offers predictions about steric asymmetry of the collisions.",Human
"We present a low-noise, high modulation-bandwidth design for a laser current driver with excellent long term stability. The driver improves upon the commonly-used Hall-Libbrecht design. The current driver can be operated remotely by way of a micro-processing unit, which controls the current set point digitally. This allows precise repeatability and improved accuracy and stability. It also allows the driver to be placed near the laser for reduced noise and for lower phase lag when using the modulation input. We present the theory of operation for our driver in detail, and give a thorough characterization of its stability, noise, set point accuracy and repeatability, temperature dependence, transient response, and modulation bandwidth.",Human
"Here we provide a detailed analysis, along with some extensions and additonal investigations, of a recently proposed self-organised model for the evolution of complex networks. Vertices of the network are characterised by a fitness variable evolving through an extremal dynamics process, as in the Bak-Sneppen model representing a prototype of Self-Organized Criticality. The network topology is in turn shaped by the fitness variable itself, as in the fitness network model. The system self-organizes to a nontrivial state, characterized by a power-law decay of dynamical and topological quantities above a critical threshold. The interplay between topology and dynamics in the system is the key ingredient leading to an unexpected behaviour of these quantities.",Human
"A MEMS based tribometer has been developed that can be read out with nanometer and nano-Newton resolution, approaching the resolution and sensitivity of a friction force microscope (FFM). It can be used to study friction of MEMS device sidewall surfaces. We find repeatable but irregular stick-slip behavior related to the surface roughness or surface modification (wear), depending on the normal force between the sliding surfaces. In addition, we show that normal force modulation can decrease the apparent friction even though the average normal force remains the same. This may be a technologically viable way to reduce friction and wear in microscopic contacts.",Human
"Light propagation in all-dielectric rod-type metamaterials is studied theoretically. The electric and magnetic dipole moments of the rods are derived analytically in the long-wavelength limit. The effective permittivity and permeability of a square lattice of rods are calculated by homogenizing the corresponding array of dipoles. The role of dipole resonances in the optical properties of the rod array is interpreted. This structure is found to exhibit a true left-handed behavior, confirming previous experiments [L. Peng \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{98}, 157403 (2007)]. A scaling analysis shows that this effect holds at optical frequencies and can be obtained by using rods made, for example, of silicon.",Human
"We assume a triple geometric structure for the electromagnetic nuclear interaction. This nuclear electromagnetism is used to calculate the binding energies of the alpha particle and the A=3 isobar nuclides. The approximation for the resultant wave equation which lead to the deuteron binding energy from the modified Mathieu equation for the radial eigenvalue equation also establishes proton-electron-proton magnetic bonds in these nuclides and determines their binding energies. Completely theoretical calculations give 28.5 Mev., 7.64 Mev. and 8.42 Mev. for the binding energies of the alpha particle, the helium 3 isotope and tritium respectively. These values admit correction factors due to the approximations made.",Human
"Measurements of atmospheric winds in the mesoscale range (10-500 km) reveal remarkably universal spectra with the $k^{-5/3}$ power law. Despite initial expectations of the inverse energy cascade, as in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, measurements of the third velocity moment in atmosphere, suggested a direct energy cascade. Here we propose a possible solution to this controversy by accounting for the presence of a large-scale coherent flow, or a spectral condensate. We present new experimental laboratory data and show that the presence of a large-scale shear flow modifies the third-order velocity moment in spectrally condensed 2D turbulence, making it, in some conditions, similar to that observed in the atmosphere.",Human
"Within a MHD approach we find magnetic reconnection to progress in two entirely different ways. The first is well-known: the laminar Sweet-Parker process. But a second, completely different and chaotic reconnection process is possible. This regime has properties of immediate practical relevance: i) it is much faster, developing on scales of the order of the Alfv\'en time, and ii) the areas of reconnection become distributed chaotically over a macroscopic region. The onset of the faster process is the formation of closed circulation patterns where the jets going out of the reconnection regions turn around and forces their way back in, carrying along copious amounts of magnetic flux.",Human
"Using path integral technique, we show exactly that for a semiflexible biopolymer in constant extension ensemble, no matter how long the polymer and how large the external force, the effects of short range correlations in the sequence-dependent spontaneous curvatures and torsions can be incorporated into a model with well-defined mean spontaneous curvature and torsion as well as a renormalized persistence length. Moreover, for a long biopolymer with large mean persistence length, the sequence-dependent persistence lengths can be replaced by their mean. However, for a short biopolymer or for a biopolymer with small persistence lengths, inhomogeneity in persistence lengths tends to make physical observables very sensitive to details and therefore less predictable.",Human
"It is well known that electro-hydrodynamical effects in freely suspended liquid films can flow the liquid. Here we report a purely electrically driven rotation in water and some other liquid suspended films with full control on the velocity and the chirality of the rotating vortices. The device, which is called ``film motor'', consists of a quasi two-dimensional electrolysis cell in an external in-plane electric field, crossing the mean electrolysis current density. If either the external field or the electrolysis voltage exceeds some threshold (while the other one is not zero), the liquid film begins to rotate. The device works perfectly with both DC and AC fields.",Human
"To achieve propulsion at low Reynolds number, a swimmer must deform in a way that is not invariant under time-reversal symmetry; this result is known as the scallop theorem. We show here that there is no many-scallop theorem. We demonstrate that two active particles undergoing reciprocal deformations can swim collectively; moreover, polar particles also experience effective long-range interactions. These results are derived for a minimal dimers model, and generalized to more complex geometries on the basis of symmetry and scaling arguments. We explain how such cooperative locomotion can be realized experimentally by shaking a collection of soft particles with a homogeneous external field.",Human
"We solve the dynamics of large spherical Minority Games (MG) in the presence of non-negligible time dependent external contributions to the overall market bid. The latter represent the actions of market regulators, or other major natural or political events that impact on the market. In contrast to non-spherical MGs, the spherical formulation allows one to derive closed dynamical order parameter equations in explicit form and work out the market's response to such events fully analytically. We focus on a comparison between the response to stationary versus oscillating market interventions, and reveal profound and partially unexpected differences in terms of transition lines and the volatility.",Human
"Being able to accurately model and predict the dynamics of dispersed inclusions transported by a turbulent flow, remains a challenge with important scientific, environmental and economical issues. One critical and difficult point is to correctly describe the dynamics of particles over a wide range of sizes and densities. Our measurements show that acceleration statistics of particles dispersed in a turbulent flow do exhibit specific size and density effects but that they preserve an extremely robust turbulent signature with lognormal fluctuations, regardless of particles size and density. This has important consequences in terms of modelling of the turbulent transport of dispersed inclusions.",Human
"We identify different types of the photonic band gaps (PBGs) of two dimensional magnetic photonic crystals (MPCs) consisting of arrays of magnetic cylinders and study the different tunability (by an external static magnetic field) of these PBGs. One type of the band gaps comes from infinitely degenerate flat bands and is closely related to those in the study of plasmonics. In addition, such PBGs are magnetically tunable and robust against position disorder. We calcualte the transmission of the PBG's and found excellent agreement with the results of the photonic band structure calculation. Positional disorder of the lattice structure affects the different types of PBGs differently.",Human
"We turn `the' Church-Turing Hypothesis from an ambiguous source of sensational speculations into a (collection of) sound and well-defined scientific problem(s):   Examining recent controversies, and causes for misunderstanding, concerning the state of the Church-Turing Hypothesis (CTH), suggests to study the CTH relative to an arbitrary but specific physical theory--rather than vaguely referring to ``nature'' in general. To this end we combine (and compare) physical structuralism with (models of computation in) complexity theory. The benefit of this formal framework is illustrated by reporting on some previous, and giving one new, example result(s) of computability and complexity in computational physics.",Human
"The possibility of neutron and neutrino detection using water Cerenkov detectors doped with gadolinium holds the promise of constructing very large high-efficiency detectors with wide-ranging application in basic science and national security. This study addressed a major concern regarding the feasibility of such detectors: the transparency of the doped water to the ultraviolet Cerenkov light. We report on experiments conducted using a 19-meter water transparency measuring instrument and associated materials test tank. Sensitive measurements of the transparency of water doped with 0.2% GdCl3 at 337nm, 400nm and 420nm were made using this instrument. These measurements indicate that GdCl3 is not an appropriate dopant in stainless steel constructed water Cerenkov detectors.",Human
"We present a geometrical representation of sum frequency generation process in the undepleted pump approximation. The analogy of such dynamics with the known optical Bloch equations is discussed. We use this analogy to present a novel technique for the achievement of both high efficiency and large bandwidth in a sum frequency conversion processes using adiabatic inversion scheme, adapted from NMR and light-matter interaction. The adiabatic constraints are derived in this context. Last, this adiabatic frequency conversion scheme is realized experimentally by a proper design of adiabatic aperiodically poled KTP device, using quasi phased matched method. In the experiments we achieved high efficiency signal to idler conversion over a bandwidth of 140nm.",Human
"Two decades after the invention of chirped pulse amplification the physical mechanism of collisionless absorption of intense laser radiation in overdense matter is still not sufficiently well understood. We show that anharmonic resonance in the self-generated plasma potential of the single plasma layers (cold plasma model) or of the individual electrons (warm plasma), respectively, constitutes the leading physical mechanism of collisionless absorption in an overdense plasma. Analogously to collisions, resonance provides for the finite phase shift of the free electron current relative to the driving laser field which is compulsory for energy transfer from the laser beam to any medium. An efficient new scenario of wave breaking is also indicated.",Human
"Recently, an interesting phenomenon of spatial localization of optical modes along periodic ray trajectories near avoided resonance crossings has been observed [J. Wiersig, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 253901 (2006)]. For the case of a microdisk cavity with elliptical cross section we use the Husimi function to analyse this localization in phase space. Moreover, we present a semiclassical explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the Goos-Haenchen shift which works very well even deep in the wave regime. This semiclassical correction to the ray dynamics modifies the phase space structure such that modes can localize either on stable islands or along unstable periodic ray trajectories.",Human
"The scaling of the longitudinal velocity structure functions, $S_q(r) = < | \delta u (r) |^q > \sim r^{\zeta_q}$, is analyzed up to order $q=8$ in a decaying rotating turbulence experiment from a large Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) dataset. The exponent of the second-order structure function, $\zeta_2$, increases throughout the self-similar decay regime, up to the Ekman time scale. The normalized higher-order exponents, $\zeta_q / \zeta_2$, are close to those of the intermittent non-rotating case at small times, but show a marked departure at larger times, on a time scale $\Omega^{-1}$ ($\Omega$ is the rotation rate), although a strictly non-intermittent linear law $\zeta_q / \zeta_2 = q/2$ is not reached.",Human
"Recent advances in photon detectors have resulted in high-density imaging arrays that offer many performance and cost advantages. In particular, the excellent transit time spread of certain devices show promise to provide tangible benefits in applications such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Meanwhile, high-density, high-performance readout techniques have not kept on pace for exploiting these developments. Photodetector readout for next generation high event rate particle identification and time-resolved PET requires a highly-integrated, low-power, and cost-effective readout technique. We propose fast waveform sampling as a method that meets these criteria and demonstrate that sub-10ps resolution can be obtained for an existing device.",Human
"The BiPo project is dedicated to the measurement of extremely low radioactive contaminations of SuperNEMO beta-beta source foils (208Tl < 2 microBq/kg and 214Bi < 10 microBq/kg). A modular BiPo1 prototype with its 20 modules and its shielding test facility is running in the Modane Underground Laboratory since February, 2008. The goal of this prototype is to study the backgrounds and particularly the surface contamination of plastic scintillators. After 2 months, a preliminary upper limit on the sensitivity of a 10 m2 BiPo detector in 208Tl contamination of selenium source foils can be extrapolated to: A(208Tl) < 7.5 microBq/kg (90 % C.L.).",Human
"This paper presents a comparative analysis of complexes made of one Rare Gas (Rg) atom and molecular hydrogen, for all five stable Rg atoms. In particular, the vibrational band origins have been calculated, as well as the structural properties of the associated wavefunctions. The study is extended to cold Rg-H$_2$ scattering. The molecular systems are studied variationally using a very simple, yet effective, trial wavefunction. A large number of Potential Energy Surfaces available from the literature is considered. A comparative analysis shows that differences of up to two orders of magnitude exist for the zero energy elastic cross sections of the five complexes. Corrections to the model have also been considered, showing no significant effect.",Human
"A photon-number-resolving detector based on a four-element superconducting nanowire single photon detector is demonstrated to have sub-30-ps resolution in measuring the arrival time of individual photons. This detector can be used to characterize the photon statistics of non-pulsed light sources and to mitigate dead-time effects in high-speed photon counting applications. Furthermore, a 25% system detection efficiency at 1550 nm was demonstrated, making the detector useful for both low-flux source characterization and high-speed photon-counting and quantum communication applications. The design, fabrication and testing of this detector are described, and a comparison between the measured and theoretical performance is presented.",Human
"We describe the so-called ""Lambda-Zeeman method"" to investigate individual hyperfine transitions between Zeeman sublevels of atoms in an external magnetic field of 0.1 mT - 0.25 T. Atoms are confined in a nanocell with thickness L = Lambda, where Lambda is the resonant wavelength (794 nm or 780 nm for D1 or D2 line of Rb). Narrow resonances in the transmission spectrum of the nanocell are split into several components in a magnetic field; their frequency positions and probabilities depend on the B-field. Possible applications are described, such as magnetometers with nanometric spatial resolution and tunable atomic frequency references.",Human
"The collisional drift wave instability is reexamined taking into account the ion response in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines, which appears due to friction with electrons and which can not be omitted in view of the momentum conservation. A modified instability threshold is obtained. In plasmas with dominant electron collisions with neutrals, the instability threshold is shifted towards higher frequencies, compared to the case of dominant electron collisions with ions. The difference between the two cases vanishes when the ion sound response is negligible, i.e., when the instability threshold disappears, and both ions and neutrals react to the electron friction in the same manner.",Human
"We have observed the propagation of an approximately 35 ns long light pulse with a negative group velocity through a laser-cooled 85Rb atomic medium. The anomalous dispersion results from linear atom-light interaction, and is unrelated to long-lived ground state coherences often associated with fast light in atomic media. The observed negative group velocity (-c/360) in the Rb magneto-optical trap for a pulse attenuated by less than 50% is in good agreement with the value of dispersion measured independently by an RF heterodyne method. The spectral region of anomalous dispersion is between 15 and 40 MHz, which is an order of magnitude wider than that typically associated with ground-state coherences.",Human
"We introduce a global quantity $\delta$ that characterizes turbulent fluctuations in inhomogeneous anisotropic flows. This time-dependent quantity is based on spatial averages of global velocity fields rather than classical temporal averages of local velocities. $\delta(t)$ provides a useful quantitative characterization of any turbulent flow through generally only two parameters, its time average $\bar \delta$ and its variance $\delta_2$. Properties of $\bar \delta$ and $\delta_2$ are experimentally studied in the typical case of the von K\'arm\'an flow and used to characterize the scale by scale energy budget as a function of the forcing mode as well as the transition between two flow topologies.",Human
"In this paper we propose a look at the capital risk problem inspired by deterministic, known from classical mechanics, problem of juggling. We propose capital equivalents to the Newton's laws of motion and on this basis we determine the most secure form of credit repayment with regard to maximisation of profit. Then we extend the Newton's laws to models in linear spaces of arbitrary dimension with the help of matrix rates of return. The matrix rates describe the evolution of multidimensional capital and they are sensitive to both quantitative changes of individual elements and flows between them. This allows us for simultaneous analysis of evolution of complex capital in both continuous and discrete time models.",Human
"Silicon nanowires have been surface functionalized with the enzyme urease for biosensor applications to detect and quantify urea concentration. The device is nanofabricated from a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer with a top down lithography approach. The differential conductance of silicon nanowires can be tuned for optimum performance using the source drain bias voltage, and is sensitive to urea at low concentration. The experimental results show a linear relationship between surface potential change and urea concentration in the range of 0.1 to 0.68 mM. The sensitivity of our devices shows high reproducibility with time and different measurement conditions. The nanowire urea biosensor offers the possibility of high quality, reusable enzyme sensor array integration with silicon based circuits.",Human
"We show that a characteristic two photon lineshape asymmetry arises in coherent population trapping (CPT) and three photon (N) resonances because both resonances are simultaneously induced by modulation sidebands in the interrogating laser light. The N resonance is a three-photon resonance in which a two-photon Raman excitation is combined with a resonant optical pumping field. This joint CPT and N resonance can be the dominant source of lineshape distortion, with direct relevance for the operation of miniaturized atomic frequency standards. We present the results of both an experimental study and theoretical treatment of the asymmetry of the joint CPT and N resonance under conditions typical to the operation of an N resonance clock.",Human
"This contribution compares several different approaches allowing one to derive macroscopic traffic equation directly from microscopic car-following models. While it is shown that some conventional approaches lead to theoretical problems, it is proposed to use a smooth particle hydrodynamic approach and to avoid gradient expansions. The derivation circumvents approximations and, therefore, demonstrates the large range of validity of macroscopic traffic equations, without the need of averaging over many vehicles. It also gives an expression for the ``traffic pressure'', which generalizes previously used formulas. Furthermore, the method avoids theoretical inconsistencies of macroscopic traffic models, which have been criticized in the past by Daganzo and others.",Human
"The correction to the wave function of the ground state in a hydrogen-like atom due to an external homogenous magnetic field is found exactly in the parameter $Z\alpha$. The $j=1/2$ projection of the correction to the wave function of the $ns_{1/2}$ state due to the external homogeneous magnetic field is found for arbitrary $n$. The $j=3/2$ projection of the correction to the wave function of the $ns_{1/2}$ state due to the nuclear magnetic moment is also found for arbitrary $n$. Using these results, we have calculated the shielding of the nuclear magnetic moment by the $ns_{1/2}$ electron.",Human
"The effects of quadratic order terms in the dispersion matrix near a mode conversion are considered. It is shown that including the corrections due to these quadratic terms gives a better matching between the local solution in the mode conversion region, and the far-field WKB solutions for the incoming and outgoing waves. This matching is demonstrated by comparison of the asymptotic solution with a numerical solution for a simple one-dimensional conversion. This procedure for obtaining the corrections due to quadratic order terms can be extended to arbitrary order and, in principle, an outline for performing such an extension is given.",Human
"We study the effect of permeabilizing electric fields applied to two different types of giant unilamellar vesicles, the first formed from EggPC lipids and the second formed from DOPC lipids. Experiments on vesicles of both lipid types show a decrease in vesicle radius which is interpreted as being due to lipid loss during the permeabilization process. We show that the decrease in size can be qualitatively explained as a loss of lipid area which is proportional to the area of the vesicle which is permeabilized. Three possible mechanisms responsible for lipid loss were directly observed: pore formation, vesicle formation and tubule formation.",Human
"We have studied transportation network, namely a road network of the Moscow region and airline network of the Russian Federation. We have constructed corresponding networks and studied degree distribution and length distribution for these networks, as well as the dependences on the average clustering coefficients and the nearest neighbours average degree as a function of the vertex degree. In conclusion we discuss degree and length distributions in the framework of the nonextensive statistics, using the maximum entropy approach and the model with additive and multiplicative noise. We present a procedure of fitting the results of the data processing to the q-type distribution which allows the fractal dimension definition of the networks under study.",Human
"We investigate the collision cascade that is generated by a single moving incident particle on a static hard-sphere gas. We argue that the number of moving particles at time t grows as t^{xi} and the number collisions up to time t grows as t^{eta}, with xi=2d/(d+2) and eta=2(d+1)/(d+2) and d the spatial dimension. These growth laws are the same as those from a hydrodynamic theory for the shock wave emanating from an explosion. Our predictions are verified by molecular dynamics simulations in d=1 and 2. For a particle incident on a static gas in a half-space, the resulting backsplatter ultimately contains almost all the initial energy.",Human
"We report the enhanced transmission of electromagnetic waves through a single subwavelength aperture by making use of the resonance behavior of a split ring resonator (SRR) at microwave frequencies. By placing a single SRR at the near-field of the aperture, strongly localized electromagnetic fields are effectively coupled to the aperture with a radius that is twenty times smaller than the resonance wavelength. We obtained 740-fold transmission enhancement by exciting the electric resonance of SRR. A different coupling mechanism, through the magnetic resonance of SRR, is also verified to yield enhanced transmission. Good agreement is obtained between the microwave measurements and numerical simulations.",Human
"A small set of final prototypes of the ATLAS Inner Detector silicon tracker (Pixel and SCT) were used to take data during the 2004 Combined Test Beam. Data were collected from runs with beams of different flavour (electrons, pions, muons and photons) with a momentum range of 2 to 180 GeV/c. Four independent methods were used to align the silicon modules. The corrections obtained were validated using the known momenta of the beam particles and were shown to yield consistent results among the different alignment approaches. From the residual distributions, it is concluded that the precision attained in the alignment of the silicon modules is of the order of 5 micrometers in their most precise coordinate.",Human
"Existing models of network growth typically have one or two parameters or strategies which are fixed for all times. We introduce a general framework where feedback on the current state of a network is used to dynamically alter the values of such parameters. A specific model is analyzed where limited resources are shared amongst arriving nodes, all vying to connect close to the root. We show that tunable feedback leads to growth of larger, more efficient networks. Exact results show that linear scaling of resources with system size yields crossover to a trivial condensed state, which can be considerably delayed with sublinear scaling.",Human
"We discuss aspects of antihydrogen studies, that relate to particle physics ideas and techniques, within the context of the ALPHA experiment at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator facility. We review the fundamental physics motivations for antihydrogen studies, and their potential physics reach. We argue that initial spectroscopy measurements, once antihydrogen is trapped, could provide competitive tests of CPT, possibly probing physics at the Planck Scale. We discuss some of the particle detection techniques used in ALPHA. Preliminary results from commissioning studies of a partial system of the ALPHA Si vertex detector are presented, the results of which highlight the power of annihilation vertex detection capability in antihydrogen studies.",Human
"We explore the dependence of the double ionization of the He atom on the frequency of a strong laser field while keeping the ponderomotive energy constant. As we increase the frequency we find that the remarkable ""finger-like"" structure for high momenta recently found for $\omega=0.055$ a.u. \cite{Staudte, Rudenko} persists for higher frequencies. At the same time, at $\omega=0.187$ a.u. a new X-shape structure emerges for small momenta that prevails in the correlated momenta distribution. The role of this structure as a signature of the frequency dependence of non-sequential double ionization is discussed.",Human
"Dielectronic recombination (DR) of few-electron ions has evolved into a sensitive spectroscopic tool for highly charged ions. This is due to technological advances in electron-beam preparation and ion-beam cooling techniques at heavy-ion storage rings. Recent experiments prove unambiguously that DR collision spectroscopy has become sensitive to 2nd order QED and to nuclear effects. This review discusses the most recent developments in high-resolution spectroscopy of low-energy DR resonances, experimental studies of KLL DR of very heavy hydrogenlike ions, isotope shift measurements of DR resonances, and the experimental determination of hyperfine induced decay rates in divalent ions utilizing DR.",Human
"We present the plane-symmetric solitonlike solutions of magnetostatic equilibria by solving the nonlinear Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation numerically. The solutions have solitonlike and periodic structures in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, and $z$ is the direction of plane symmetry. Although such solutions are unstable against the numerical iteration, we give the procedure to realize the sufficient convergence. Our result provides the definite answer for the existence of the solitonlike solutions that was questioned in recent years. The method developed in this paper will make it possible to study the axisymmetric solitonlike solutions of the nonlinear GS equation, which could model astrophysical jets with knotty structures.",Human
"Unlike conventional lasers, diffusive random lasers (DRLs) have no resonator to trap light and no high-Q resonances to support lasing. Due to this lack of sharp resonances the DRL has presented a challenge to conventional laser theory. We present a theory able to treat the DRL rigorously, and provide results on the lasing spectra, internal fields and output intensities of DRLs. Typically DRLs are highly multimode lasers, emitting light at a number of wavelengths. We show that the modal interactions through the gain medium in such lasers are extremely strong and lead to a uniformly spaced frequency spectrum, in agreement with recent experimental observations.",Human
"Significant systematic errors in high-precision Penning trap mass spectrometry can result from electric and magnetic field imperfections. An experimental procedure to minimize these uncertainties is presented for the on-line Penning trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP, located at ISOLDE/CERN. The deviations from the ideal magnetic and electric fields are probed by measuring the cyclotron frequency and the reduced cyclotron frequency, respectively, of stored ions as a function of the time between the ejection of ions from the preparation trap and their capture in the precision trap, which influences the energy of their axial motion. The correction parameters are adjusted to minimize the frequency shifts.",Human
"An extension to the P3M algorithm for electrostatic interactions is presented, that allows to efficiently compute dipolar interactions in periodic boundary conditions. Theoretical estimates for the root-mean square error of the forces, torques and the energy are derived. The applicability of the estimates is tested and confirmed in several numerical examples. A comparison of the computational performance of the new algorithm to state-of-the-art dipolar Ewald summation methods shows a performance crossover from the Ewald method to the dipolar P3M method for as few as 300 dipolar particles. In larger systems, the new algorithm represents a substantial improvement in performance with respect to the dipolar standard Ewald method.",Human
"We report on a program of geodetic measurements between 1994 and 2007 which used the Very Long Baseline Array and up to 10 globally distributed antennas. One of the goals of this program was to monitor positions of the array at a 1 millimeter level of accuracy and to tie the VLBA into the International Terrestrial Reference Frame. We describe the analysis of these data and report several interesting geophysical results including measured station displacements due to crustal motion, earthquakes, and antenna tilt. In terms of both formal errors and observed scatter, these sessions are among the very best geodetic VLBI experiments.",Human
"Based on the Lorenz model derived from the equations of hydrodynamics of nebula, we discuss the formation of binary stars by the qualitative analysis theory of nonlinear equation. Here the two wings in the Lorenz model form just the binary stars, whose Roche surface is result of evolution under certain condition. The nonlinear interaction plays a crucial role, and is necessary condition of the formation of binary stars and of multiple stars. While the linear equations form only a single star. Moreover, the Lorenz model may be obtained from synergetics yet, and some dynamical equations of the order parameter can also form the binary star system.",Human
A clinical study was performed comparing the efficacy of multimedia learning modules with traditional textbooks for the first few topics of a calculus based introductory electricity and magnetism course. Students were randomly assigned to three different groups experiencing different presentations of the material; one group received the multimedia learning module presentations and the other two received the presentations via written text. All students were then tested on their learning immediately following the presentations as well as two weeks later. The students receiving the multimedia learning modules performed significantly better than the students experiencing the text-based presentations on both tests.,Human
"In this paper we present an empirical study of the worldwide maritime transportation network (WMN) in which the nodes are ports and links are container liners connecting the ports. Using the different representation of network topology namely the space $L$ and $P$, we study the statistical properties of WMN including degree distribution, degree correlations, weight distribution, strength distribution, average shortest path length, line length distribution and centrality measures. We find that WMN is a small-world network with power law behavior. Important nodes are identified based on different centrality measures. Through analyzing weighted cluster coefficient and weighted average nearest neighbors degree, we reveal the hierarchy structure and ""rich-club"" phenomenon in the network.",Human
"An expression for the mutual coherence function (MCF) of an electromagnetic beam wave propagating through atmospheric turbulence is derived within the confines of the Rytov approximation. It is shown that both the first and second Rytov approximations are required. The Rytov MCF is then compared to that which issues from the parabolic equation method of strong fluctuation theory. The agreement is found to be quite good in the weak fluctuation case. However, an instability is observed for the special case of beam wave intensities. The source of the instabilities is identified to be the characteristic way beam wave amplitudes are treated within the Rytov method.",Human
"We develop a diagrammatic perturbation treatment to calculate the zero-temperature equation of state of the dilute gas mixture of a single spin component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and a normal Fermi gas of indistinguishable (single spin) fermion particles. We find that the mean-field description breaks down near the mechanical instability related to the phase separation phenomenon. Our analysis shows that the instability is caused by the competition of the usual short-range and fermion-mediated boson-boson interactions, which result in a boson compressibility that diverges. In the low BEC-density limit, we show that the diagrammatic analysis simplifies, we sum part of the higher order diagrams, and we discuss the effects of other higher-order contributions.",Human
"We show that a binary-staircase optical element can be engineered to exhibit an effective negative index of refraction, thereby expanding the range of optical properties theoretically available for future optoelectronic devices. The mechanism for achieving a negative-index lens is based on exploiting the periodicity of the surface corrugation. By designing and nanofabricating a plano-concave binary-staircase lens in the InP/InGaAsP platform, we have experimentally demonstrated at 1.55 microns that such negative-index concave lenses can focus plane waves. The beam propagation in the lens was studied experimentally and was in excellent agreement with the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations.",Human
"The introduction of intermediate states in the dynamics of the voter model modifies the ordering process and restores an effective surface tension. The logarithmic coarsening of the conventional voter model in two dimensions is eliminated in favour of an algebraic decay of the density of interfaces with time, compatible with Model A dynamics at low temperatures. This phenomenon is addressed by deriving Langevin equations for the dynamics of appropriately defined continuous fields. These equations are analyzed using field theoretical arguments and by means of a recently proposed numerical technique for the integration of stochastic equations with multiplicative noise. We find good agreement with lattice simulations of the microscopic model.",Human
"A method to derive stationary solutions of the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system is explored. In the non-relativistic case, a method using the Hermite polynomial series to describe the deviation from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is found to be successful in deriving a few stationary solutions including two dimensional one. Instead of the Hermite polynomial series, two special orthogonal polynomial series, which are appropriate to expand the deviation from the Maxwell-J\""uttner distribution, are introduced in this paper. By applying this method, a new two-dimensional equilibrium is derived, which may provide an initial setup for investigations of three-dimensional relativistic collisionless reconnection of magnetic fields.",Human
"The fluid theory of plasmas is extended to include the properties of electron spin. The linear theory of waves in a magnetized plasma is presented, and it is shown that the spin effects causes a change of the magnetic permeability. Furthemore, by changing the direction of the external magnetic field, the magnetic permability may become negative. This leads to instabilities in the long wavelength regimes. If these can be controlled, however, the spin plasma becomes a metamaterial for a broad range of frequencies, i.e. above the ion cyclotron frequency but below the electron cyclotron frequency. The consequences of our results are discussed.",Human
We present a compact and transportable inertial sensor for precision sensing of rotations and accelerations. The sensor consists of a dual Mach-Zehnder-type atom interferometer operated with laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb. Raman processes are employed to coherently manipulate the matter waves. We describe and characterize the experimental apparatus. A method for passing from a compact geometry to an extended interferometer with three independent atom-light interaction zones is proposed and investigated. The extended geometry will enhance the sensitivity by more than two orders of magnitude which is necessary to achieve sensitivities better than $10^{-8} $rad/s/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$.,Human
"CaF2(111) single crystal surfaces have been irradiated with swift heavy ions under oblique angles resulting in chains of nanosized hillocks. In order to characterize these nanodots with respect to their conductivity we have applied non-contact atomic force microscopy using a magnetic tip. Measurements in UHV as well as under ambient conditions reveal a clearly enhanced electromagnetic interaction between the magnetic tip and the nanodots. The dissipated energy per cycle is comparable to the value found for metals, indicating that the interaction of the ion with the target material leads to the creation of metallic Ca nanodots on the surface.",Human
"The modern notion of a black hole singularity is considered with reference to the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity. A brief derivation of both the original and the modern line elements is given. The argument is put forward that the singularity occurring within the Schwarzschild line element that has been associated with the radius of the black hole event horizon is, in fact, merely a mathematical occurrence and does not exist physically. The real aim here, however, is to attempt to open up the whole problem, draw some conclusions, but finally to urge everyone to consider the points raised with no preconceived opinions and then come to their own final conclusion.",Human
"We determine the Lorentz transformations and the kinematic content and dynamical framework of special relativity as purely an extension of Galileo's thoughts. No reference to light is ever required: The theories of relativity are logically independent of any properties of light. The thoughts of Galileo are fully realized in a system of Lorentz transformations with a parameter 1/c^2, some undetermined, universal constant of nature; and are realizable in no other. Isotropy of space plays a deep and pivotal role in all of this, since here three-dimensional space appears at first blush, and persists until the conclusion: Relativity can never correctly be fully developed in just one spatial dimension.",Human
"The extreme ultraviolet (XUV) emission from dense plasmas generated with sub-10-fs laser pulses with varying peak intensities up to 3*10^16 W/cm^2 is investigated for different target materials. K shell spectra are obtained from low Z targets (carbon and boron nitride). In the spectra a series limit for the hydrogen and helium like resonance lines is observed indicating that the plasma is at high density and pressure ionization has removed the higher levels. In addition, L shell spectra from titanium targets were obtained. Basic features of the K and L shell spectra are reproduced with computer simulations. The calculations include hydrodynamic simulation of the plasma expansion and collisional radiative calculations of the XUV emission.",Human
"We have studied the Steiner tree problem using six-pin soap films in detail. We extend the existing method of experimental realisation of Steiner trees in $n$-terminal problem through soap films to observe new non-minimal Steiner trees. We also produced spanning tree configurations for the first time by our method. Experimentally, by varying the pin diameter, we have achieved these new stable soap film configurations. A new algorithm is presented for creating these Steiner trees theoretically.   Exact lengths of these Steiner tree configurations are calculated using a geometrical method. An exact two-parameter empirical formula is proposed for estimating the lengths of these soap film configurations in six-pin soap film problem.",Human
"In a previous comment (arXiv:0806.1341v1) we criticized purely technical aspects of arXiv:0712.1645 but pointed out that many other inconsistencies were readily apparent. In view of the imminent posting of another version of arXiv:0712.1645, still containing these issues, we would like to offer with this additional note a critical guide to the methodology followed by the TEXONO collaboration, in their effort to extract dark matter limits from a spectral region completely dominated by electronic noise. We find that systematics have been neglected through a combination of erroneous assumptions and failure to explore all of their possible sources.",Human
"Si nanocrystals (Si-NC) in a-SiOx<Er> were created by high temperature annealing. Si-NC samples have large emission in a broadband region, 700nm to 1000nm. Annealing temperature, annealing time, substrate type, and erbium concentration is studied to allow emission at 1550 nm forsamples with erbium. Emission in the C-Band region is largely reduced by the presence of Si-NC. This reduction may be due to less efficient energy transfer processes from the nanocrystals than from the amorphous matrix to the Er3+ ions, perhaps due to the formation of more centro-symmetric Er3+ sites at the nanocrystal surfaces or to very different optimal erbium concentrations between amorphous and crystallized samples.",Human
"We develop a projection imaging technique to study ultracold plasma dynamics. We image the charged particle spatial distributions by extraction with a high-voltage pulse onto a position-sensitive detector. Measuring the 2D width of the ion image at later times (the ion image size in the first 20 $\mu$s is dominated by the Coulomb explosion of the dense ion cloud), we extract the plasma expansion velocity. These velocities at different initial electron temperatures match earlier results obtained by measuring the plasma oscillation frequency. The electron image size slowly decreases during the plasma lifetime because of the strong Coulomb force of the ion cloud on the electrons, electron loss and Coulomb explosion effects.",Human
"We present two models of continuous opinion dynamics under bounded confidence which are representable as nonnegative discrete dynamical systems, namely the Hegselmann-Krause model (Hegselmann and Krause, Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 5(3), 2002) and the Deffuant-Weisbuch model (Deffuant et al, Advances in Complex Systems, 3, 2000). We fully characterize the set of fixed points for both models. They are identical. Further on, we present reformulations of both models on the more general level of densities of agents in the opinion space as interactive Markov chains. We also characterize the sets of fixed points as identical in both models.",Human
"We report on normal stress field measurements at the multicontact interface between a rough elastomeric film and a smooth glass sphere under normal load, using an original MEMS-based stress sensing device. These measurements are compared to Finite Elements Method calculations with boundary conditions obeying locally Amontons' rigid-plastic-like friction law with a uniform friction coefficient. In dry contact conditions, significant deviations are observed which decrease with increasing load. In lubricated conditions, the measured profile recovers almost perfectly the predicted profile. These results are interpreted as a consequence of the finite compliance of the multicontact interface, a mechanism which is not taken into account in Amontons' law.",Human
"The limit cycle of the van der Pol oscillator, $\ddot{x}+ \epsilon (x^2-1) \dot{x} + x =0$, is studied in the plane $(x,\dot{x})$ by applying the homotopy analysis method. A recursive set of formulas that approximate the amplitude and form of this limit cycle for the whole range of the parameter $\epsilon$ is obtained. These formulas generate the amplitude with an error less than 0.1%. To our knowledge, this is the first time where an analytical approximation of the amplitude of the van der Pol limit cycle, with validity from the weakly up to the strongly nonlinear regime, is given.",Human
"We study an extension of Axelrod's model for social influence, in which cultural drift is represented as random perturbations, while mass media are introduced by means of an external field. In this scenario, we investigate how the modular structure of social networks affects the propagation of mass media messages across the society. The community structure of social networks is represented by coupled random networks, in which two random graphs are connected by intercommunity links. Considering inhomogeneous mass media fields, we study the conditions for successful message spreading and find a novel phase diagram in the multidimensional parameter space. These findings show that social modularity effects are of paramount importance in order to design successful, cost-effective advertising campaigns.",Human
"We study the effect of advection and small diffusion on passive tracers. The advecting velocity field is assumed to have mean zero and to possess time-periodic stream lines. Using a canonical transform to action-angle variables followed by a Lie-transform, we derive an averaged equation describing the effective motion of the tracers. An estimate for the time validity of the first-order approximation is established. For particular cases of a regularized vortical flow we present explicit formulas for the coefficients of the averaged equation both at first and at second order. Numerical simulations indicate that the validity of the above first-order estimate extends to the second order.",Human
We evaluate the realization of a novel geometry of a guided atom interferometer based on a high temperature superconducting microstructure. The interferometer type structure is obtained with a guiding potential realized by two current carrying superconducting wires in combination with a closed superconducting loop sustaining a persistent current. We present the layout and realization of our superconducting atom chip. By employing simulations we discuss the critical parameters of the interferometer guide in particular near the splitting regions of the matter waves. Based on measurements of the relevant chip properties we discuss the application of a compact and reliable on-chip atom interferometer.,Human
"We stabilize an ultraviolet diode laser system at 369.5 nm to the optical absorption signal from Yb+ ions in a hollow-cathode discharge lamp. The error signal for stabilization is obtained by Zeeman spectroscopy of the 3 GHz-wide absorption feature. The frequency stability is independently measured by comparison against the fluorescence signal from a laser-cooled crystal of 174Yb+ ions in a linear Paul trap. We measure a frequency fluctuation of 1.7 MHz RMS over 1000 s, and a frequency drift of 20 MHz over 7 days. Our method is suitable for use in quantum information processing experiments with trapped ion crystals.",Human
"We reformulate the problem of modularity maximization over the set of partitions of a network as a conic optimization problem over the completely positive cone, converting it from a combinatorial optimization problem to a convex continuous one. A semidefinite relaxation of this conic program then allows to compute upper bounds on the maximum modularity of the network. Based on the solution of the corresponding semidefinite program, we design a randomized algorithm generating partitions of the network with suboptimal modularities. We apply this algorithm to several benchmark networks, demonstrating that it is competitive in accuracy with the best algorithms previously known. We use our method to provide the first proof of optimality of a partition for a real-world network.",Human
"The elastic scattering amplitudes of indistinguishable, bosonic, strongly-polar molecules possess universal properties at the coldest temperatures due to wave propagation in the long-range dipole-dipole field. Universal scattering cross sections and anisotropic threshold angular distributions, independent of molecular species, result from careful tuning of the dipole moment with an applied electric field. Three distinct families of threshold resonances also occur for specific field strengths, and can be both qualitatively and quantitatively predicted using elementary adiabatic and semi-classical techniques. The temperatures and densities of heteronuclear molecular gases required to observe these univeral characteristics are predicted. PACS numbers: 34.50.Cx, 31.15.ap, 33.15.-e, 34.20.-b",Human
We demonstrate experimentally an optical system for under-sampling several bandwidth limited signals with carrier frequencies that are not known apriori that can be located anywhere within a very broad frequency region between 0-18 GHz. The system is based on under-sampling asynchronously at three different sampling rates. The pulses required for the under-sampling are generated by a combination of an electrical comb generator and an electro-absorption modulator. To reduce loss and improve performance the implementation of the optical system is based on a wavelength division multiplexing technique. An accurate reconstruction of both the phase and the amplitude of the signals was obtained when two chirped signals generated simultaneously were sampled.,Human
"Interference is one of the most fundamental features which characterizes quantum systems. Here we provide an exhaustive analysis of the interfere dynamics associated with wave-packet superpositions from both the standard quantum-mechanical perspective and the Bohmian one.   From this analysis, clear and insightful pictures of the physics involved in this kind of processes are obtained, which are of general validity (i.e., regardless of the type of wave packets considered) in the understanding of more complex cases where interference is crucial (e.g., scattering problems, slit diffraction, quantum control scenarios or, even, multipartite interactions). In particular, we show how problems involving wave-packet interference can be mapped onto problems of wave packets scattered off potential barriers.",Human
"We analyze the dynamics of a paramagnetic, dipolar molecule in a generic ""magneto-electrostatic'' trap where both magnetic and electric fields may be present. The potential energy that governs the dynamics of the molecules is found using a reduced molecular model that incorporates the main features of the system. We discuss the shape of the trapping potentials for different field geometries, as well as the possibility of nonadiabatic transitions to untrapped states, i.e., the analog of Majorana transitions in a quadrupole magnetic atomic trap. Maximizing the lifetime of molecules in a trap is of great concern in current experiments, and we assess the effect of nonadiabatic transitions on obtainable trap lifetimes.",Human
"We present a new algorithm for vibrational control in deuterium molecules that is feasible with current experimental technology. A pump mechanism is used to create a coherent superposition of the D2+ vibrations. A short, intense infrared control pulse is applied after a chosen delay time to create selective interferences. A `chessboard' pattern of states can be realized in which a set of even- or odd-numbered vibrational states can be selectively annihilated or enhanced. A technique is proposed for experimental realization and observation of this effect using 5 fs pulses of 790 nm radiation, with intermediate intensity (5e13 W/cm2)",Human
"Carbon-rich meteorites, carbonaceous chondrites, contain many biologically relevant organic molecules and delivered prebiotic material to the young Earth. We present compound-specific carbon isotope data indicating that measured purine and pyrimidine compounds are indigenous components of the Murchison meteorite. Carbon isotope ratios for uracil and xanthine of delta13C=+44.5per mil and +37.7per mil, respectively, indicate a non-terrestrial origin for these compounds. These new results demonstrate that organic compounds, which are components of the genetic code in modern biochemistry, were already present in the early solar system and may have played a key role in life's origin.",Human
"TeV scale lepton-hadron and photon-hadron colliders are necessary both to clarify fundamental aspects of strong interactions and for adequate interpretation of the LHC data. Today, there are two realistic proposals for the post-HERA era, namely, QCD Explorer (QCD-E) and Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC). Both QCD-E and LHeC can operate as eA colliders, whereas gamma-p and gamma-A options are unique for QCD-E. Another advantage of QCD-E is the possibility to increase the center of mass energy by lengthening of electron linac. In this presentation main parameters of the QCD-E nucleus options are discussed.",Human
"We present a method which delivers a continuous, high-density beam of slow and internally cold polar molecules. In our source, warm molecules are first cooled by collisions with a cryogenic helium buffer gas. Cold molecules are then extracted by means of an electrostatic quadrupole guide. For ND$_3$ the source produces fluxes up to $(7 \pm ^{7}_{4}) \times 10^{10}$ molecules/s with peak densities up to $(1.0 \pm ^{1.0}_{0.6}) \times 10^9$ molecules/cm$^3$. For H$_2$CO the population of rovibrational states is monitored by depletion spectroscopy, resulting in single-state populations up to $(82 \pm 10)%$.",Human
"In this manuscript, we analytically and numerically study statistical properties of an heteroskedastic process based on the celebrated ARCH generator of random variables whose variance is defined by a memory of $q_{m}$-exponencial, form ($e_{q_{m}=1}^{x}=e^{x}$). Specifically, we inspect the self-correlation function of squared random variables as well as the kurtosis. In addition, by numerical procedures, we infer the stationary probability density function of both of the heteroskedastic random variables and the variance, the multiscaling properties, the first-passage times distribution, and the dependence degree. Finally, we introduce an asymmetric variance version of the model that enables us to reproduce the so-called leverage effect in financial markets.",Human
"We report on the first results of a sensitive search for scalar coupling of photons to a light neutral boson in the mass range of approximately 1.0 milli-electron volts and coupling strength greater than 10$^-6$ GeV$^-1$ using optical photons. This was a photon regeneration experiment using the ""light shining through a wall"" technique in which laser light was passed through a strong magnetic field upstream of an optical beam dump; regenerated laser light was then searched for downstream of a second magnetic field region optically shielded from the former. Our results show no evidence for scalar coupling in this region of parameter space.",Human
"We report the observation of above-threshold dissociation of a multielectron molecular system, Na$_2^+$. The process is due to continuum-continuum transitions in a field-dressed molecular continuum. Three well resolved fragmentation channels with different kinetic energy release patterns have been detected, of which, two are associated with ordinary photodissociation via light-induced potentials into Na(3s) + Na$^+$ and Na(3p) + Na$^+$, and one with continuum-continuum transitions and above-threshold dissociation into Na(3p) + Na$^+$. We show that when we dress this molecule with a field whose intensity is ~3 x 10$^{12}$ W/cm$^2$, above-threshold dissociation prevails over other processes, such as field-ionization followed by Coulomb explosion.",Human
"Coherent Synchrotron Radiation can severely limit the performance of accelerators designed for high brightness and short bunch length. Examples include light sources based on ERLs or FELs, and bunch compressors for linear colliders. In order to better simulate Coherent Synchrotron Radiation, the established 1-dimensional formalism is extended to work at lower energies, at shorter bunch lengths, and for an arbitrary configuration of multiple bends. Wide vacuum chambers are simulated by means of vertical image charges. This formalism has been implemented in the general beam dynamics code ""Bmad"" and its results are here compared to analytical approximations, to numerical solutions of the Maxwell equations, and to the simulation code ""elegant"".",Human
"Cells swimming in confined environments are attracted by surfaces. We measure the steady-state distribution of smooth-swimming bacteria (Escherichia coli) between two glass plates. In agreement with earlier studies, we find a strong increase of the cell concentration at the boundaries. We demonstrate theoretically that hydrodynamic interactions of the swimming cells with solid surfaces lead to their re-orientation in the direction parallel to the surfaces, as well as their attraction by the closest wall. A model is derived for the steady-state distribution of swimming cells, which compares favorably with our measurements. We exploit our data to estimate the flagellar propulsive force in swimming E. coli.",Human
"We present, solve and numerically simulate a simple model that describes the consequences of increased longevity on fertility rates, population growth and the distribution of wealth in developed societies. We look at the consequences of the repeated use of life extension techniques and show that they represent a novel commodity whose introduction will profoundly influence key aspects of economy and society in general. In particular, we uncover two phases within our simplified model, labeled as 'mortal' and 'immortal'. Within the life extension scenario it is possible to have sustainable economic growth in a population of stable size, as a result of dynamical equilibrium between the two phases.",Human
"The impact of a drop onto a liquid layer and the subsequent splash has important implications for diverse physical processes such as air-sea gas transfer, cooling, and combustion. In the {\it crown splash} parameter regime, the splash pattern is highly regular. We focus on this case as a model for the mechanism that leads to secondary droplets, and thus explain the drop size distribution resulting from the splash. We show that the mean number of secondary droplets is determined by the most unstable wavelength of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Variations from this mean are governed by the width of the spectrum. Our results for the crown splash will provide the basis for understanding more complicated splashes.",Human
"Courses on undergraduate quantum mechanics usually focus on solutions of the Schr\""odinger equation for several simple one-dimensional examples. When the notion of a Hilbert space is introduced only academic examples are used, such as the matrix representation of Dirac's raising and lowering operators or the angular momentum operators. We introduce some of the same one-dimensional examples as matrix diagonalization problems, with a basis that consists of the infinite set of square well eigenfunctions. Undergraduate students are well equipped to handle such problems in familiar contexts. We pay special attention to the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. This paper should equip students to obtain the low lying bound states of any one-dimensional short range potential.",Human
"We present experimental results on turbulence generated in thin fluid layers in the presence of a large-scale coherent flow, or a spectral condensate. It is shown that the condensate modifies the third-order velocity moment in a much wider interval of scales than the second one. The modification may include the change of sign of the third moment in the inverse cascade. This observation may help resolve a controversy on the energy flux in mesoscale atmospheric turbulence (10-500 km): to recover a correct energy flux from the third velocity moment one needs first to subtract the coherent flow. We find that the condensate also increases the velocity flatness.",Human
"We analyse the recent rapid growth of 'binge' drinking in the UK. This means the consumption of large amounts of alcohol, especially by young people, leading to serious anti-social and criminal behaviour in urban centres. We show how a simple agent-based model, based on binary choice with externalities, combined with a small amount of survey data can explain the phenomenon. We show that the increase in binge drinking is a fashion-related phenomenon, with imitative behaviour spreading across socila networks The results show that a small world network, rather than a random or scale free, offers the best description of the key aspects of the data",Human
"In forced polymer translocation, the average translocation time, $\tau$, scales with respect to pore force, $f$, and polymer length, $N$, as $\tau \sim f^{-1} N^{\beta}$. We demonstrate that an artifact in Metropolis Monte Carlo method resulting in breakage of the force scaling with large $f$ may be responsible for some of the controversies between different computationally obtained results and also between computational and experimental results. Using Langevin dynamics simulations we show that the scaling exponent $\beta \le 1 + \nu$ is not universal, but depends on $f$. Moreover, we show that forced translocation can be described by a relatively simple force balance argument and $\beta$ to arise solely from the initial polymer configuration.",Human
"A new type of simplified cloaks with matched exterior boundaries is proposed. The cloak uses non-magnetic material for the TM polarization and can function with a relatively thin thickness. It is shown that the $zero^{th}$ order scattering of such cloak is dominant among all cylindrical scattering terms. A gap is added at the cloak's inner surface to eliminate the zero-th order scattering, through the mechanism of scattering resonance. The reduction in scattering is relatively smooth, indicating that the proposed scattering reduction method has good tolerance to perturbations. Numerical simulations also confirm that the proposed structure has very low scattering.",Human
We propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a coherent microwave photonic receiver operating at 35 GHz carrier frequency. The device is based on a lithium niobate or lithium tantalate optical whispering gallery mode resonator coupled to a microwave strip line resonator. Microwave local oscillator is fed into the microwave resonator along with the microwave signal. We show that the sensitivity of this receiver significantly exceeds the sensitivity of the incoherent quadratic receiver based on the same technology. The coherent receiver can possess a dynamic range in excess of 100 dB in 5 MHz band if a low noise laser is utilized.,Human
"In this paper, we introduce the experiment based on a sensitive torsion pendulum for measuring and calibrating small forces at nanonewton scale. The force standard for calibration is the universal gravitation between four masses separated by known distances. It is realized by two test masses suspended as the part of torsion pendulum and two source masses on a rotation table. Two force generation mechanisms, optical force from radiation pressure and electrostatic force by capacitive actuation unit, are designed and will be calibrated by the gravitation force. We present our recent results of radiation pressure measurements, and describe the design of capacitive displacement sensing/actuating unit.",Human
We measure the photoionization cross-section of vibrationally excited levels in the S2 state of azulene by femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. At the wavelengths studied (349-265 nm in the pump) the transient signals exhibit two distinct and well-defined behaviours: (i) Short-term (on the order of a picosecond) polarization dependent transients and (ii) longer (10 ps - 1 ns) time-scale decays. This letter focuses on the short time transient. In contrast to an earlier study by Diau et al.22 [J. Chem. Phys. 110 (1999) 9785.] we unambiguously assign the fast initial decay signal to rotational dephasing of the initial alignment created by the pump transition.,Human
"It has been shown recently that chemical bond lengths, in general, like those in the components of nucleic acids, caffeine related compounds, all essential amino acids, methane, benzene, graphene and fullerene are sums of the radii of adjacent atoms constituting the bond. Earlier, the crystal ionic distances in all alkali halides and lengths of many partially ionic bonds were also accounted for by the additivity of ionic as well as covalent radii. Here, the atomic structures of riboflavin and its reduced form are presented based on the additivity of the same set of atomic radii as for other biological molecules.",Human
"Using first-principles density functional calculations, we have studied the structural stability of stoichiometric as well as non-stoichiometric CdS nanoclusters at ambient pressure with diameters ranging up to about 2.5 nm. Our study reveals that the relative stability of the two available structures for CdS, namely zinc blende and wurtzite, depends sensitively on the details like surface geometry and/or surface chemistry. The associated band gap also exhibits non-monotonic behavior as a function of cluster size. Our findings may shed light on reports of experimentally observed structures and associated electronic structures of CdS nanoclusters found in the literature.",Human
"Microwave bandpass filters constructed from materials exhibiting some nonlinearity, such as superconductors, will generate intermodulation distortion (IMD) when subjected to signals at more than one frequency. In commercial applications of superconductive receive filters, it is possible for IMD to be generated when a weak receive signal mixes with very strong out-of-band signals, such as those coming from the transmitter. A measurement procedure was developed and data were taken on several different types of superconducting bandpass filters, all developed for commercial application. It was found that in certain interference situations, the 3-tone mixing can produce a spur that is noticeable by the receiver, but that there are simple preventative design solutions.",Human
"We introduce a novel class of spatial complex variable function Gaussian (CVF-Gaussian) beam, which is the product of an arbitrary analytic complex variable function and a Gaussian function, in strongly nonlocal nonlinear media (SNNM). The CVF-Gaussian beam rotates generally during propagation. By choosing the input power of the beam, we can obtain the CVF-Gaussian breather or the CVF-Gaussian soliton. We reveal that stable CVF-Gaussian beam can exist in SNNM with different forms, including rotating dipole, and rotating elliptic donut. A distribution factor which is the parameter for the description of the transverse distribution of the CVF-Gaussian beam is discussed.",Human
"We study atom-ion scattering in the ultracold regime. To this aim, an analytical model based on the multichannel quantum defect formalism is developed and compared to close-coupled numerical calculations. We investigate the occurrence of magnetic Feshbach resonances focusing on the specific 40Ca+ - Na system. The presence of several resonances at experimentally accessible magnetic fields should allow the atom-ion interaction to be precisely tuned. A fully quantum-mechanical study of charge exchange processes shows that charge-exchange rates should remain small even in the presence of resonance effects. Most of our results can be cast in a system-independent form and are important for the realization of the charge-neutral ultracold systems.",Human
"A series of phenomena pertaining to economics, quantum physics, language, literary criticism, and especially architecture is studied from the standpoint of synergetics (the study of self-organizing complex systems). It turns out that a whole series of concrete formulas describing these phenomena is identical in these different situations. This is the case of formulas relating to the Bose-Einstein distribution of particles and the distribution of words from a frequency dictionary. This also allows to apply a ""quantized"" from of the Zipf law to the problem of the authorship of 'Quiet Flows the Don' and to the""blending in"" of new architectural structures in an existing environment.",Human
"Reciprocal movement cannot be used for locomotion at low-Reynolds number in an infinite fluid or near a rigid surface. Here we show that this limitation is relaxed for a body performing reciprocal motions near a deformable interface. Using physical arguments and scaling relationships, we show that the nonlinearities arising from reciprocal flow-induced interfacial deformation rectify the periodic motion of the swimmer, leading to locomotion. Such a strategy can be used to move toward, away from, and parallel to any deformable interface as long as the length scales involved are smaller than intrinsic scales, which we identify. A macro-scale experiment of flapping motion near a free surface illustrates this new result.",Human
"The search of the correct equation of motion for a classical charged particle under the action of its electromagnetic (EM) self-field, the so-called \textit{radiation-reaction equation of motion}, remains elusive to date. In this paper we intend to point out why this is so. The discussion is based on the direct construction of the EM self-potentials produced by a charged spherical particle under the action of an external EM force. In particular we intend to analyze basic features of the LAD (Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac) and the LL (Landau-Lifschitz) equations. Both are shown to lead to incorrect or incomplete results.",Human
"A characterisation of scintillating fibres with silicon photomultiplier read-out was performed in view of their possible application in fibre tracking detector systems. Such a concept is being considered for the Kaos spectrometer at the Mainz Microtron MAMI and as a time-of-flight start detector for the hypernuclear physics programme at the PANDA experiment of the FAIR project. Results on particle detection effciency and time resolution are discussed. In summary, the silicon devices are very suitable for the detection of the low light yield from scintillating fibres insofar a trigger scheme is found to cope with the noise rate characteristics.",Human
"We present angular distributions of photoelectrons of atomic model systems excited by intense linearly polarized laser pulses in the VUV- and XUV-regime. We solve the multi-dimensional time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation for one particle on large spatial grids and investigate the direction dependence of the ionized electrons for isotropic s-states as well as p-states. Although the ponderomotive potential is small compared to the binding energy of the initially bound electron and the photon energy of the exciting laser field, richly structured photoelectron angular distributions are found which sensitively depend on the laser frequency and intensity as well as on the number of absorbed photons. The occuring shapes are explained in terms of scattering mechanisms.",Human
"Benzene is a hexagonal molecule of six carbon atoms, each of which is bound to six hydrogen atoms. The equality of all six CC bond lengths, despite the alternating double and single bonds, and the surplus (resonance) energy, led to the suggestion of two resonanting structures. Here, the new atomic structure shows that the bond length equality is due to three carbon atoms with double bond radii bound to three other carbon atoms with resonance bond radii (as in graphene). Consequently, there are two kinds of CH bonds of slightly different lengths. The bond energies account for the resonance energy.",Human
"We present numerical simulations of circular Couette flow in axisymmetric and fully three-dimensional geometry of a cylindrical annulus inspired by Princeton MRI liquid gallium experiment. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved with the spectral element code Nek5000 incorporating realistic horizontal boundary conditions of differentially rotating rings. We investigate the effect of changing rotation rates (Reynolds number) and of the horizontal boundary conditions on flow structure, Ekman circulation and associated transport of angular momentum through the onset of unsteadiness and three-dimensionality. A mechanism for the explanation of the dependence of the Ekman flows and circulation on horizontal boundary conditions is proposed.",Human
"In this paper, we discuss the equation of state for nonlinear spinor gases in the context of cosmology. The mean energy momentum tensor is similar to that of the prefect fluid, but an additional function of state $W$ is introduced to describe the nonlinear potential. The equation of state $w(a)\lesssim -1$ in the early universe is calculated, which provides a natural explanation for the negative pressure of dark matter and dark energy. $W$ may be also the main origin of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. So the nonlinear spinor gases may be a candidate for dark matter and dark energy.",Human
"The resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations as usually defined in the quasineutral approximation refer to a system of 14 scalar equations in 14 scalar variables, hence are determined to be complete and soluble. These equations are a combination of Navier-Stokes and a subset of Maxwell's. However, one of the vector equations is actually an identity when viewed from the potential formulation of electrodynamics, hence does not determine any degrees of freedom. Only by reinstating Gauss's law does the system of equations become closed, allowing for the determination of both the current and mass flow velocity from the equations of motion. Results of a typical analysis of the proposed electromagnetic hydrodynamic model including the magnetization force are presented.",Human
"The inclusion of plasma magnetization in the equations of stationary equilibrium is derived, and its effect on the determination of axisymmetric equilibrium calculated. A factor of 2 on the pressure gradient arises in the equilibrium equation from the force felt by the dipole moment density. The algebraic and differential equation formulations are compared both with and without consideration of magnetization, revealing the effects of both magnetization and magnetic field variation on the equilibrium, which become more pronounced for high pressures in a weak external field. The equivalence of the magnetized equilibrium equation with the standard equilibrium equation in the limit of vanishing magnetization is demonstrated.",Human
"Variations in the electrostatic surface potential between the proof mass and electrode housing in the space-based gravitational wave mission LISA is one of the largest contributors of noise at frequencies below a few mHz. Torsion balances provide an ideal testbed for investigating these effects in conditions emulative of LISA. Our apparatus consists of a Au coated Cu plate brought near a Au coated Si plate pendulum suspended from a thin W wire. We have measured a white noise level of $30, \uVhz$ above approximately 0.1, mHz, rising at lower frequencies, for the surface potential variations between these two closely spaced metals.",Human
"A method is proposed for producing monoergetic, high-quality ion beams in vacuum, via direct acceleration by the electromagnetic field of two counterpropagating, variable-frequency lasers: ions are trapped and accelerated by a beat-wave structure with variable phase velocity, allowing for fine control over the energy and the charge of the beam via tuning of the frequency variation. The physical mechanism is described with a one-dimensional theory, providing the general conditions for trapping and scaling laws for the relevant features of the ion beam. Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations, in which hydrogen gas is considered as an ion source, confirm the validity and the robustness of the method.",Human
We observe high-resolution diffraction patterns of a thermal-energy helium-atom beam reflected from a microstructured surface grating at grazing incidence. The grating consists of 10-$\mu$m-wide Cr strips patterned on a quartz substrate and has a periodicity of 20 $\mu$m. Fully-resolved diffraction peaks up to the $7^{\rm th}$ order are observed at grazing angles up to 20 mrad. With changes in de Broglie wavelength or grazing angle the relative diffraction intensities show significant variations which shed light on the nature of the atom-surface interaction potential. The observations are explained in terms of quantum reflection at the long-range attractive Casimir-van der Waals potential.,Human
"Technology-Enhanced Formative Assessment (TEFA) is a pedagogy for teaching with classroom response technology. Teacher Learning of TEFA is a five-year research project studying teacher change, in the context of an intensive professional development program designed to help science and mathematics teachers learn TEFA. First, we provide an overview of the project's participating teachers, its intervention (consisting of the technology, the pedagogy, and the professional development program), and its research design. Then, we present narratives describing the unfolding change process experienced by four teachers. Afterward, we present some preliminary findings of the research, describe a ""model for the co-evolution of teacher and pedagogy"" that we are developing, and identify general implications for professional development.",Human
"The two-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation is used to describe the propagation of an intense laser beam through a medium with Kerr nonlinearity. The coupled two-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equations are used to describe interaction of electromagnetic waves with different polarizations in nonlinear optics. In this paper, we solve the above equations by imposing a quadratic condition on the related argument functions and using their symmetry transformations. More complete families of exact solutions of such type are obtained. Many known interesting solutions, such soliton ones, turn out to be special cases of our solutions.",Human
We investigate the effect of exciton coupling on the optical absorption spectrum of polymer molecules under conditions of strong inhomogeneous broadening. We demonstrate that the dependence of the maximum in the rescaled absorption spectrum on the number of monomers is determined by the average monomer excitation energies and their resonant coupling and insensitive to the inhomogeneous broadening. Thus the absorption spectrum can be used to determine optical interactions between monomers. The results are applied to the absorption spectra of poly-A poly-T DNA hairpins and used to interpret the dependence of the absorption spectrum on the number of monomers. We also discuss exciton localization in these hairpins.,Human
"A common goal in an experimental physics analysis is to extract information from a reaction with multi-dimensional kinematics. The preferred method for such a task is typically the unbinned maximum likelihood method. In fits using this method, the likelihood is a goodness-of-fit quantity in that it effectively discriminates between available hypotheses; however, it does not provide any information as to how well the best hypothesis describes the data.   In this paper, we present an {\em ad-hoc} procedure for obtaining chi**2/n.d.f. values from unbinned maximum likelihood fits. This method does not require binning the data, making it very applicable to multi-dimensional problems.",Human
"A monolithic pixel sensor in deep-submicron Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) CMOS technology has been designed, manufactured and characterised. This technology is of significant interest for applications in particle tracking and imaging. The prototype chip features pixels of 10 micron pitch arrayed in two analog sections and one digital section with a comparator and a latch integrated in each pixel. The prototype response has been tested with infrared lasers and with the 1.35 GeV electron beam extracted from the injection booster at the LBNL Advanced Light Source. Results from irradiation tests with low energy protons and neutrons performed at the LBNL 88-inch Cyclotron are also presented.",Human
"The behavior of small samples in very short and intense hard x-ray pulses is studied by molecular dynamics type calculations. The main emphasis is put on the effect of various tamper layers about the sample. This is discussed from the point of view of structural imaging of single particles, including not only the distortion of the structure but also the background conditions. A detailed picture is given about the Coulomb explosion, with explanation of the tampering mechanism. It is shown that a thin water layer is efficient in slowing down the distortion of the atomic structure, but it gives a significant contribution to the background.",Human
"Self-arrangement of individuals into spatial patterns often accompanies and promotes species diversity in ecological systems. Here, we investigate pattern formation arising from cyclic dominance of three species, operating near a bifurcation point. In its vicinity, an Eckhaus instability occurs, leading to convectively unstable ""blurred"" patterns. At the bifurcation point, stochastic effects dominate and induce counterintuitive effects on diversity: Large patterns, emerging for medium values of individuals' mobility, lead to rapid species extinction, while small patterns (low mobility) promote diversity, and high mobilities render spatial structures irrelevant. We provide a quantitative analysis of these phenomena, employing a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.",Human
"We analyze a systematic algorithm for the exact computation of the current cumulants in stochastic nonequilibrium systems, recently discussed in the framework of full counting statistics for mesoscopic systems. This method is based on identifying the current cumulants from a Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation expansion for the generating function. Here it is derived from a simple path-distribution identity and extended to the joint statistics of multiple currents. For a possible thermodynamical interpretation, we compare this approach to a generalized Onsager-Machlup formalism. We present calculations for a boundary driven Kawasaki dynamics on a one-dimensional chain, both for attractive and repulsive particle interactions.",Human
"The concepts of primary and reciprocal experiments and base and travelling frames in special relativity are concisely described and applied to several different space-time experiments. These include Einstein's train/embankment thought experiment and a related thought experiment, due to Sartori, involving two trains in parallel motion with different speeds. Spatially separated clocks which are synchronised in their common proper frame are shown to be so in all inertial frames and their spatial separation to be Lorentz invariant. The interpretions given by Einstein and Sartori of their experiments, as well as those given by the present author in previous papers, are shown to be erroneous.",Human
"The complex theoretical and experimental investigation of plasma kinetics of the electric discharge in the mixture of air and ethanol-water vapors is carried out. The discharge was burning in the cavity, formed by air jets pumping between electrodes, placed in aqueous ethanol solution. It is found out that the hydrogen yield from the discharge is maximal in the case when ethanol and water in the solution are in equal amounts. It is shown that the hydrogen production increases with the discharge power and reaches the saturation at high value. The concentrations of the main stable gas-phase components, measured experimentally and calculated numerically, agree well in the most cases.",Human
"In this paper various extensions of the design strategy of transformation media are proposed. We show that it is possible to assign different transformed spaces to the field strength tensor (electric field and magnetic induction) and to the excitation tensor (displacement field and magnetic field), resp. In this way, several limitations of standard transformation media can be overcome. In particular it is possible to provide a geometric interpretation of non-reciprocal as well as indefinite materials. We show that these transformations can be complemented by a continuous version of electric-magnetic duality and comment on the relation to the complementary approach of field-transforming metamaterials.",Human
"The properties of a special class of correlated many-body wave functions, named rotating vortex clusters (RVCs), that preserve the total angular momentum of a small cloud of trapped rotating bosons are investigated. They have lower energy and provide a superior description for the formation of vortices compared to the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) states that break the rotational symmetry. The GP vortex states are shown to be wave packets composed of such RVC states. Our results suggest that, for a small number of bosons, the physics is different from that of ideal Bose-Einstein condensates which characterize larger assemblies",Human
"We demonstrate a 10-GHz bandwidth digitizer with 7-effective bits of resolution and 52dB SFDR, using photonic time stretch technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of the same bandwidth, with at least an order of magnitude higher SNR than previously achieved. This is made possible by correction of distortion due to time warps, and non-linearities due to wavelength dependent bias variation in the Mach-Zehnder modulator. We also demonstrate concatenation of 30 wavelength interleaved time segments with high fidelity on the path to achieving continuous time operation.",Human
"The Green Nagdhi equations are frequently used as a model of the wave-like behaviour of the free surface of a fluid, or the interface between two homogeneous fluids of differing densities. Here we show that their multilayer extension arises naturally from a framework based on the Euler Poincare theory under an ansatz of columnar motion. The framework also extends to the travelling wave solutions of the equations. We present numerical solutions of the travelling wave problem in a number of flow regimes. We find that the free surface and multilayer waves can exhibit intriguing differences compared to the results of single layer or rigid lid models.",Human
"CCCP, a CCD Controller for Counting Photons, is presented. This new controller uses a totally new clocking architecture and allows to drive the CCD in a novel way. Its design is optimized for the driving of EMCCDs at up to 20MHz of pixel rate and fast vertical transfer. Using this controller, the dominant source of noise of EMCCDs at low flux level and high frame rate, the Clock Induced Charges, were reduced to 0.001 - 0.0018 electron/pixel/frame (depending of the electron multiplying gain), making efficient photon counting possible. CCCP will be deployed in 2009 on the ESO NTT through the 3D-NTT1 project and on the SOAR through the BTFI project.",Human
"Excitable membranes are an important type of nonlinear dynamical system and their study can be used to provide a connection between physical and biological circuits. We discuss two models of excitable membranes important in cardiac and neural tissues. One model is based on the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations and the other is based on a three-transistor excitable circuit. We construct a circuit that simulates reentrant tachycardia and its treatment by surgical ablation. This project is appropriate for advanced undergraduates as a laboratory capstone project, or as a senior thesis or honors project, and can also be a collaborative project, with one student responsible for the computational predictions and another for the circuit construction and measurements.",Human
"Evolution of belief systems has always been in focus of cognitive research. In this paper we delineate a new model describing belief systems as a network of statements considered true. Testing the model a small number of parameters enabled us to reproduce a variety of well-known mechanisms ranging from opinion changes to development of psychological problems. The self-organizing opinion structure showed a scale-free degree distribution. The novelty of our work lies in applying a convenient set of definitions allowing us to depict opinion network dynamics in a highly favorable way, which resulted in a scale-free belief network. As an additional benefit, we listed several conjectural consequences in a number of areas related to thinking and reasoning.",Human
"The characteristic properties of two-phase Ar avalanche detectors, including those obtained with CsI photocathode, are further studied. Such detectors are relevant in the field of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark matter search experiments. The detectors investigated comprised a 1 cm thick liquid Ar layer followed by a triple-GEM multiplier. In these detectors, typical gains reaching 10000 were obtained with good reproducibility and a stable operation for at least one day was demonstrated. Amplitude and pulse-shape characteristics are presented under irradiation with X-rays, gamma-rays and neutrons from different radioactive sources. The detection of both primary scintillation and ionization signals at higher gains, at a deposited energy of 60 keV, has been demonstrated.",Human
"We study the evolution of a reactive field advected by a one-dimensional compressible velocity field and subject to an ignition-type nonlinearity. In the limit of small molecular diffusivity the problem can be described by a spatially discretized system, and this allows for an efficient numerical simulation. If the initial field profile is supported in a region of size l < lc one has quenching, i.e., flame extinction, where lc is a characteristic length-scale depending on the system parameters (reacting time, molecular diffusivity and velocity field). We derive an expression for lc in terms of these parameters and relate our results to those obtained by other authors for different flow settings.",Human
"Radiometric data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecrafts have revealed an unexplained constant acceleration of a_A = (8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^(-10) m s^(-2) towards the Sun, also known as the Pioneer anomaly. Different groups have analyzed the Pioneer data and have got the same results, which rules out computer programming and handling errors. Attempts to explain this phenomenon arguing intrinsic causes on-board the spacecrafts failed or have lead to inconclusive results. Therefore, the Pioneer anomalous acceleration has motivated the interest of researchers to find out explanations that could bring insight upon the forces acting in the outer Solar Systems or a hint to discover new natural laws.",Human
"The purpose of this paper is to calculate the two-photon decay rate corresponding to the two-photon transitions nS->1S and nD->1S in hydrogenlike ions with a low nuclear charge number Z (for principal quantum numbers n = 2,...,8. Numerical results are obtained within a nonrelativistic framework, and the results are found to scale approximately as (Z alpha)^6/n^3, where alpha is the fine-structure constant. We also attempt to clarify a number of subtle issues regarding the treatment of the coherent, quasi-simultaneous emission of the two photons as opposed to one-photon cascades. In particular, the gauge invariance of the decay rate is shown explicitly.",Human
"Factors that contribute to the temperature dependence of a resonant frequency in a low-expansion optical cavity are discussed, including deformation at the cavity ends due to different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the spacer, optically-contacted mirror substrate and coating. A model of the temperature dependence is presented that incorporates finite-element-analysis of the cavity ends. A measurement of frequency versus temperature of a cavity mode is used along with the model to deduce a spacers CTE versus temperature profile. The measured profile correlates very well with a separate experiment utilizing a temporary surface-mounted Fabry-Perot cavity fabricated on the outside of the spacer with hydroxy-catalysis bonding.",Human
"For many complex networks present in nature only a single instance, usually of large size, is available. Any measurement made on this single instance cannot be repeated on different realizations. In order to detect significant patterns in a real--world network it is therefore crucial to compare the measured results with a null model counterpart. Here we focus on dense and weighted networks, proposing a suitable null model and studying the behaviour of the degree correlations as measured by the rich-club coefficient. Our method solves an existing problem with the randomization of dense unweighted graphs, and at the same time represents a generalization of the rich--club coefficient to weighted networks which is complementary to other recently proposed ones.",Human
"Exciton effects are studied in single-wall boron-nitride nanotubes. The Coulomb interaction dependence of the band gap, the optical gap, and the binding energy of excitons are discussed. The optical gap of the (5,0) nanotube is about 6eV at the onsite interaction U=2t with the hopping integral t=1.1eV. The binding energy of the exciton is 0.50eV for these parameters. This energy agrees well with that of other theoretical investigations. We find that the energy gap and the binding energy are almost independent of the geometries of nanotubes. This novel property is in contrast with that of the carbon nanotubes which show metallic and semiconducting properties depending on the chiralities.",Human
"The evolution of vocabulary in academic publishing is characterized via keyword frequencies recorded the ISI Web of Science citations database. In four distinct case-studies, evolutionary analysis of keyword frequency change through time is compared to a model of random copying used as the null hypothesis, such that selection may be identified against it. The case studies from the physical sciences indicate greater selection in keyword choice than in the social sciences. Similar evolutionary analyses can be applied to a wide range of phenomena; wherever the popularity of multiple items through time has been recorded, as with web searches, or sales of popular music and books, for example.",Human
"We report exact expressions for atomic forces in the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method when using nonlocal pseudopotentials. We present approximate schemes for estimating these expressions in both mixed and pure DMC calculations, including the pseudopotential Pulay term which has not previously been calculated and the Pulay nodal term which has not been calculated for real systems in pure DMC simulations. Harmonic vibrational frequencies and equilibrium bond lengths are derived from the DMC forces and compared with those obtained from DMC potential energy curves. Results for four small molecules show that the equilibrium bond lengths obtained from our best force and energy calculations differ by less than 0.002 Angstrom.",Human
"We report the production and benchmarking of several refinements of the power method that enable the computation of multiple extremal eigenpairs of very large matrices. In these refinements we used an observation by Booth that has made possible the calculation of up to the 10$^{th}$ eigenpair for simple test problems simulating the transport of neutrons in the steady state of a nuclear reactor. Here, we summarize our techniques and efforts to-date on determining mainly just the two largest or two smallest eigenpairs. To illustrate the effectiveness of the techniques, we determined the two extremal eigenpairs of a cyclic matrix, the transfer matrix of the two-dimensional Ising model, and the Hamiltonian matrix of the one-dimensional Hubbard model.",Human
"In this paper, we define energy-momentum density as a product of the complex vector electromagnetic field and its complex conjugate. We derive an equation for the spacetime derivative of the energy-momentum density. We show that the scalar and vector parts of this equation are the differential conservation laws for energy and momentum, and the imaginary vector part is a relation for the curl of the Poynting vector. We can show that the spacetime derivative of this energy-momentum equation is a wave equation. Our formalism is Dirac-Pauli-Hestenes algebra in the framework of Clifford (Geometric) algebra Cl_{4,0}.",Human
"We present a measurement of the hyperfine splitting of the 6S$_{1/2}$ excited level of rubidium using two photon absorption spectroscopy in a glass cell. The values we obtain for the magnetic dipole constant A are 239.18(03) MHz and 807.66(08) MHz for $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb, respectively. The combination of the magnetic moments of the two isotopes and our measurements show a hyperfine anomaly in this atomic excited state. The observed hyperfine anomaly difference has a value of $_{87}\delta_{85}=-0.0036(2)$ due to the finite distribution of nuclear magnetization, the Bohr-Weisskopf effect.",Human
"We present a scheme to establish non-classical correlations in the motion of two macroscopically separated massive particles without resorting to entanglement in their internal degrees of freedom. It is based on the dissociation of a diatomic molecule with two temporally separated Feshbach pulses generating a motional state of two counter-propagating atoms that is capable of violating a Bell inequality by means of correlated single particle interferometry. We evaluate the influence of dispersion on the Bell correlation, showing it to be important but manageable in a proposed experimental setup. The latter employs a molecular BEC of fermionic Lithium atoms, uses laser-guided atom interferometry, and seems to be within the reach of present-day technology.",Human
"The influence of nano-metal films on the Goos-Haenchen shift (GHS) is investigated. The films deposited at the total reflecting surface of a perspex prism/air have a sheet resistance varying between Z = 25 and 3 000 Ohm. A resonance-like enhancement of the shift and of the absorption is found for TE polarized waves, when the sheet resistance approaches the value of the vacuum impedance. For TM waves the influence of the metal films on the GHS is comparatively weak. The experiments are carried out with microwaves. Keywords: Goos-Haenchen shift; nano-metallic films, microwaves PACS: 42.25.Bs, 42.25.Gy, 42.50.-p, 73.40.Gk",Human
"We report the observation of quantized translational and rotational motion of molecular hydrogen inside the cages of C60. Narrow infrared absorption lines at the temperature of 6K correspond to vibrational excitations in combination with translational and rotational excitations and show well resolved splittings due to the coupling between translational and rotational modes of the endohedral H2 molecule. A theoretical model shows that H2 inside C60 is a three-dimensional quantum rotor moving in a nearly spherical potential. The theory provides both the frequencies and the intensities of the observed infrared transitions. Good agreement with the experimental results is obtained by fitting a small number of empirical parameters to describe the confining potential, as well as the ortho to para ratio.",Human
"We have investigated the formation of helium droplets in two physical situations. In the first one, droplets are atomised from superfluid or normal liquid by a fast helium vapour flow. In the second, droplets of normal liquid are formed inside porous glasses during the process of helium condensation. The context, aims, and results of these experiments are reviewed, with focus on the specificity of light scattering by helium. In particular, we discuss how, for different reasons, the closeness to unity of the index of refraction of helium allows in both cases to minimise the problem of multiple scattering and obtain results which it would not be possible to get using other fluids.",Human
"The continuous-discrete filtering problem requires the solution of a partial differential equation known as the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov forward equation (FPKfe). In this paper, it is pointed out that for a state model with an affine, linear drift and state-independent diffusion matrix the fundamental solution can be obtained using only linear algebra techniques. In particular, no differential equations need to be solved. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the size of the time step size, or on the measurement model. Also discussed are important computational aspects that are crucial for potential real-time implementation for higher-dimensional problems. The solution is universal in the sense that the initial distribution may be arbitrary.",Human
"When used with coherent light, optical imaging systems, even diffraction-limited, are inherently unable to reproduce both the amplitude and the phase of a two-dimensional field distribution because their impulse response function varies slowly from point to point (a property known as non-isoplanatism). For sufficiently small objects, this usually results in a phase distortion and has no impact on the measured intensity. Here, we show that the intensity distribution can also be dramatically distorted when objects of large extension or of special shapes are imaged. We illustrate the problem using two simple examples: the pinhole camera and the aberration-free thin lens. The effects predicted by our theorical analysis are also confirmed by experimental observations.",Human
"Networks in nature possess a remarkable amount of structure. Via a series of data-driven discoveries, the cutting edge of network science has recently progressed from positing that the random graphs of mathematical graph theory might accurately describe real networks to the current viewpoint that networks in nature are highly complex and structured entities. The identification of high order structures in networks unveils insights into their functional organization. Recently, Clauset, Moore, and Newman, introduced a new algorithm that identifies such heterogeneities in complex networks by utilizing the hierarchy that necessarily organizes the many levels of structure. Here, we anchor their algorithm in a general community detection framework and discuss the future of community detection.",Human
"Despite the importance of urban traffic flows, there are only a few theoretical approaches to determine fundamental relationships between macroscopic traffic variables such as the traffic density, the utilization, the average velocity, and the travel time. In the past, empirical measurements have primarily been described by fit curves. Here, we derive expected fundamental relationships from a model of traffic flows at intersections, which suggest that the recently measured fundamental diagrams for urban flows can be systematically understood. In particular, this allows one to derive the average travel time and the average vehicle speed as a function of the utilization and/or the average number of delayed vehicles.",Human
"We investigate the energy levels of heteronuclear alkali metal dimers in levels correlating with the lowest rotational level of the ground electronic state, which are important in efforts to produce ground-state ultracold molecules. We use density-functional theory to calculate nuclear quadrupole and magnetic coupling constants for RbK and RbCs and explore the hyperfine structure in the presence of electric and magnetic fields. For nonrotating states, the zero-field splittings are dominated by the electron-mediated part of the nuclear spin-spin coupling. They are a few kHz for RbK isotopologs and a few tens of kHz for RbCs isotopologs.",Human
"We studied complex lasing pattern formations in a thin-slice solid-state laser with wide-aperture laser-diode end-pumping. Radial and rectangular vortex arrays were found to be formed in a controlled fashion with symmetric and asymmetric pump beam profiles, respectively. Most of these vortices exhibited single-frequency oscillations arising from a spontaneous process of transverse mode locking of nearly degenerate modes assisted by the laser nonlinearity. Single-frequency rectangular array beams consisting of a large number of vortices, e.g., closely packed 36 or 46 vortex pixels, were generated, originating from Ince-Gaussian modes excited by the asymmetric pumping.",Human
The electronic and structural properties of zigzag and armchair single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) with a single vacancy or two vacancies located at various distances have been obtained within the frame of the Density Function Theory (DFT) and a Molecular Dynamics method. It is found that the vacancy defects interact at long ranges in armchair SWCNTs unlike the short-range interaction in zigzag SWCNTs. The density of states for different vacancy densities shows that the local energy gap shrinks with the vacancy density increase. This and other results of the investigation provide insight into understanding the relation between the local deformation of a defective nanotube and its measurable electronic properties.,Human
The magnetic field of the permanent magnet electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source SWISSCASE located at the University of Bern has been numerically simulated and experimentally investigated. For the first time the magnetized volume qualified for electron cyclotron resonance at 10.88 GHz and 388.6 mT has been analyzed in highly detailed 3D simulations with unprecedented resolution. The observed pattern of carbon coatings on the source correlates strongly with the electron and ion distribution in the ECR plasma of SWISSCASE. Under certain plasma conditions the ion distribution is tightly bound to the electron distribution and can considerably simplify the numerical calculations in ECR related applications such as ECR ion engines and ECR ion implanters.,Human
"Inviscid flow within an evaporating sessile drop is analyzed. The field equation, E^2(Psi)=0, is solved for the stream function. The exact analytical solution is obtained for arbitrary contact angle and distribution of evaporative flux along the free boundary. Specific results and computations are presented for evaporation corresponding to both uniform flux and purely diffusive gas phase transport into an infinite ambient. Wetting and non-wetting contact angles are considered with flow patterns in each case being illustrated. The limiting behaviors of small contact angle and droplets of hemispherical shape are treated. All of the above categories are considered for the cases of droplets whose contact lines are either pinned or free to move during evaporation.",Human
"We empirically study the genealogical trees of ten families for about five centuries in Korea. Although each family tree contains only the paternal part, the family names of women married to the family have been recorded, which allows us to estimate roughly the family name distributions for the past five hundred years. Revealed is the fact that the unique Korean family name distribution, characterized by a logarithmic form of the cumulative distribution and an exponentially decaying rank-size plot often called the Zipf plot, has remained unchanged for a long time. We discuss the implications of our results within a recently suggested theoretical model and compare them with observations in other countries in which power-law forms are abundantly found.",Human
"The model describing market dynamics after a large financial crash is considered in terms of the stochastic differential equation of Ito. Physically, the model presents an overdamped Brownian particle moving in the nonstationary one-dimensional potential $U$ under the influence of the variable noise intensity, depending on the particle position $x$. Based on the empirical data the approximate estimation of the Kramers-Moyal coefficients $D_{1,2}$ allow to predicate quite definitely the behavior of the potential introduced by $D_1 = - \partial U /\partial x$ and the volatility $\sim \sqrt{D_2}$. It has been shown that the presented model describes well enough the best known empirical facts relative to the large financial crash of October 1987. \",Human
The article presents an alternative approach to the definition of vector electrodynamic potential and its properties. It is shown that generally it has vortical and potential components. The system of differential equations of generalized electrodynamics (the macroscopical theory) is written down; and on the basis of these equations the mechanism of occurrence of the electromagnetic waves spreading in the direction of vector (longitudinal E-waves) is explained. It is demonstrated that the new macroscopical theory is in accordance with quantum electrodynamics. The author investigates the issue of physical pithiness of longitudinal electromagnetic E-waves and specifies the references to the experimental researches confirming the new theory.,Human
"SuperNEMO is a next-generation double beta decay experiment based on the successful tracking plus calorimetry design approach of the NEMO3 experiment currently running in the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM). SuperNEMO can study a range of isotopes, the baseline isotopes are 82Se and possibly 150Nd. The total isotope mass will be 100-200 kg. A sensitivity to neutrinoless double beta decay half-life greater than 10e26 years can be reached which gives access to Majorana neutrino masses of 50-100 meV. One of the main challenges of the SuperNEMO R&D is the development of the calorimeter with an unprecedented energy resolution of 4% FWHM at 3 MeV (Qbb value of 82Se).",Human
"Myosin V was the first discovered processive motor from the myosin family. It has therefore been subject of a number of mechanical, kinetic, optical and structural studies and now belongs to the best characterised motor proteins. This effort has been accompanied by a number of different theoretical models. In this article we give an overview of them and discuss what they have in common and where the open questions are. The latter include the existence of sub-steps, the process that limits the run length, the nature of backward steps, the flexibility of the lever arm and the state of the lead head.",Human
"A dynamical system description of the transition process in shear flows with no linear instability starts with a knowledge of exact coherent solutions, among them travelling waves (TWs) and relative periodic orbits (RPOs). We describe a numerical method to find such solutions in pipe flow and apply it in the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation from a TW which looks to be especially relevant for transition. The dominant structural feature of the RPO solution is the presence of weakly modulated streaks. This RPO, like the TW from which it bifurcates, sits on the laminar-turbulent boundary separating initial conditions which lead to turbulence from those which immediately relaminarise.",Human
"A Bragg resonator uses dielectric plates within a metallic cavity to confine the energy within a central free space region. The importance of the permittivity is shown with a better Q-factor possible using higher permittivity materials of larger intrinsic dielectric losses. This is because the electric energy in the reflectors decreases proportionally to the square root of permittivity and the coupling to the metallic losses decrease linearly. In a sapphire resonator with a single reflector pair a Q-factor of 2.34x10^5 is obtained, which may be improved on by up to a factor of 2 using higher permittivity materials.",Human
We propose a multi-scale approach to understanding physics related to the ion/proton-beam cancer therapy and calculation of the probability of the DNA damage as a result of irradiation of patients with energetic (up to 430 MeV/u) ions. This approach is inclusive with respect to different scales starting from the long scale defined by the ion stopping followed by a smaller scale defined by secondary electrons and radicals ending with the shortest scale defined by interactions of secondaries with the DNA. We present calculations of the probabilities of single and double strand breaks of the DNA and suggest a way of further elaboration of such calculations.,Human
"Strong incompressible three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is investigated by means of high resolution direct numerical simulations. The simulations show that the configuration space is characterized by regions of positive and negative cross-helicity, corresponding to highly aligned or anti-aligned velocity and magnetic field fluctuations, even when the average cross-helicity is zero. To elucidate the role of cross-helicity, the spectra and structure of turbulence are obtained in imbalanced regions where cross-helicity is non-zero. When averaged over regions of positive and negative cross-helicity, the result is consistent with the simulations of balanced turbulence. An analytical explanation for the obtained results is proposed.",Human
"We present a mathematical approach that simplifies the theoretical treatment of electromagnetic localization in random media and leads to closed form analytical solutions. Starting with the assumption that the dielectric permittivity of the medium has delta-correlated spatial fluctuations, and using the Ito lemma, we derive a linear stochastic differential equation for a one dimensional random medium. The equation leads to localized wave solutions. The localized wave solutions have a localization length that scales inversely with the square of the frequency of the wave in the low frequency regime, whereas in the high frequency regime, this length varies inversely with the frequency to the power of two thirds.",Human
"Cell is the structural and functional unit of life. This Resource Letter serves as a guide to the literature on nano-machines which drive not only intracellular movements, but also motility of the cell. These machines are usually proteins or macromolecular assemblies which require appropriate fuel for their operations. Although, traditionally, these machines were subjects of investigation in biology and biochemistry, increasing use of the concepts and techniques of physics in recent years have contributed to the quantitative understanding of the fundamental principles underlying their operational mechanisms. The possibility of exploiting these principles for the design and control of artificial nano-machines has opened up a new frontier in the bottom-up approach to nano-technology.",Human
"A scheme for fast, compact, and controllable acceleration of heavy particles in vacuum has been recently proposed [F. Peano et al., New J. Phys. 10 033028 (2008)], wherein two counterpropagating laser beams with variable frequencies drive a beat-wave structure with variable phase velocity, leading to particle trapping and acceleration. The technique allows for fine control over the energy distribution and the total charge of the accelerated beam, to be obtained via tuning of the frequency variation. Here, the theoretical bases of the acceleration scheme are described, and the possibility of applications to ultrafast muon acceleration and to the prompt extraction of cold-muon beams is discussed.",Human
"In 1983, Thornhill showed that Planck's energy distribution for a black-body radiation field could be derived for a gas-like aether with Maxwellian statistics. Further, it was shown that the frequency of electromagnetic waves correlates with the energy per unit mass of the particles, not with their energy, thus differing from Planck's quantum hypothesis. He pointed out that de Broglie, in a paper of 1922, was on the way to achieving this result but did not pursue the matter to its logical conclusion. Here a translation of de Broglie's paper is presented to draw attention to this point. Some brief additional comments are included also.",Human
"A hybrid Car-Parrinello QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation has been carried out for the Watson-Crick base pair of 9-ethyl-8-phenyladenine and 1-cyclohexyluracil in deuterochloroform solution at room temperature. The resulting trajectory is analyzed putting emphasis on the N-H$...$N Hydrogen bond geometry. Using an empirical correlation between the $\NN$-distance and the fundamental NH-stretching frequency, the time-dependence of this energy gap along the trajectory is obtained. From the gap-correlation function we determine the infrared absorption spectrum using lineshape theory in combination with a multimode oscillator model. The obtained average transition frequency and the width of the spectrum is in reasonable agreement with recent experimental data.",Human
"Nadel's Paradox states that it is not possible to take into account simultaneously cultural and relational dimensions of social structure. By means of a simple computational model, the authors explore a dynamic perspective of the concept of social cohesion that enables the integration of both structural and cultural dimensions in the same analysis. The design of the model reproduces a causal path from the level of conflict suffered by a population to variations on its social cohesiveness, observed both from a structural and cognitive viewpoint. Submitted to sudden variations on its environmental conflict level, the model is able to reproduce certain characteristics previously observed in real populations under situations of emergency or crisis.",Human
"The light yield of a water-based Cherenkov detector can be significantly improved by adding a wavelength shifter. Wavelength shifter (WLS) molecules absorb ultraviolet photons and re-emit them at longer wavelengths where typical photomultiplier tubes are more sensitive. In this study, several wavelength shifter compounds are tested for possible deployment in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO). Test results on optical properties and chemical compatibility for a few WLS candidates are reported; together with timing and gain measurements. A Monte Carlo simulation of the SNO detector response is used to estimate the total light gain with WLS. Finally, a cosmic ray Cherenkov detector was built to investigate the optical properties of WLS.",Human
"We perform precision measurements of the branching ratios of the 4P3/2 level decay of a single 40Ca+ ion suspended in a linear Paul trap. High precision is achieved by a novel technique based on monitoring the population transfer when repeatedly pumping the ion between different internal states. The branching fractions into the 4S1/2, 3D5/2 and 3D3/2 levels are found to be 0.9347(3), 0.0587(2) and 0.00661(4), respectively. For the branching ratio A(P3/2-S1/2)/\sum_J A(P3/2-D_J)=14.31(5), we find a forty-fold improvement in accuracy as compared to the best previous measurement.",Human
"Classical electrodynamics can be divided into two parts. In the first one, with the use of a plenty of directed quantities, namely multivectors and differential forms, no scalar product is necessary. It is called premetric electrodynamics. In this part, principal laws of the theory can be tackled, among them the two observer-independent Maxwell's equations. The second part concerns specific media and requires establishing of a scalar product and, consequently a metric. We present an axiomatic approach to electrodynamics in which the metric enters as late as possible. Also a line of research is mentioned in which the notion of non-inertial observer is studied and its influence on observer- dependent Maxwell equations.",Human
"Individual spinors in a SU(2) spin network are described by their relations to the background spin network. A 'covariant' formulation of these relations yields the de Sitter group SO(3,2) as the fundamental symmetry group. Locally this symmetry group is approximated by the Poincare group, which leaves invariant (certain) clusters of spinors. The calculated masses of these clusters reproduce the lepton spectrum. Corrections to the approximate Poincare group, based on the exact SO(3,2) symmetry, deliver interaction terms, identical to those of the standard model. In addition, gravitation is obtained. The calculation of the fine-structure constant reproduces Wyler's formula.",Human
"We calculated the contribution of Coulomb energy to the spacing between the ground and first excited state of $^{229}$Th nucleus as a function of the deformation parameter $\delta$. We show that despite the fact that the odd particle is a neutron, the change in Coulomb energy between these two states can reach several hundreds KeV.This means that the effect of the variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$ may be enhanced   $\Delta U_C/E \sim 10^4$ times in the $E=$7.6 eV ""nuclear clock"" transition between the ground and first excited states in the $^{229}$Th nucleus.",Human
"Ultracold LiCs molecules in the absolute ground state X$^1\Sigma^+$, v""=0, J""=0 are formed via a single photo-association step starting from laser-cooled atoms. The selective production of v""=0, J""=2 molecules with a 50-fold higher rate is also demonstrated. The rotational and vibrational state of the ground state molecules is determined in a setup combining depletion spectroscopy with resonant-enhanced multi-photon ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy. Using the determined production rate of up to 5x10^3 molecules/s, we describe a simple scheme which can provide large samples of externally and internally cold dipolar molecules.",Human
"Traditional derivation of the material time derivative of volume, surface, and line integrals relies upon the notion of a referential configuration of continuum. Such a notion, however, is artificial and, probably, somewhat misleading in cases of liquids, gases, plastic flow of solids etc. It is, consequently, desirable to separate the formal calculation of the material time derivative of time-dependent integrals from any physics that can be related with them. Such a separation is targeted in the present letter where no referential continuum configuration or other physical notion is involved. The material time derivative of volume, surface, and line integrals is presented as a purely mathematical manipulation.",Human
"This text describes a generalization of the analytic signal (Gabor, 1946) approach for the definition of instantaneous amplitude and phase to the case of multivariate signals. It was originally written as an appendix for another paper, where the determination of the locally dominant oscillatory direction (the instantaneous amplitude) described here is used as a preprocessing step for another kind of data analysis. The text is reproduced in a 'standalone' form because the procedure might prove useful in other contexts too, especially for the purpose of phase synchronization analysis (Rosenblum et al., 1996) between two (or more) multivariate sets of time series (Pascual-Marqui, 2007).",Human
"Roy P. Kerr has discovered his celebrated metric 45 years ago, yet the problem to find a generalization of the Schwarzschild metric for a rotating mass was faced much earlier. Lense and Thirring, Bach, Andress, Akeley, Lewis, van Stockum and others have tried to solve it or to find an approximative solution at least. In particular Achilles Papapetrou, from 1952 to 1961 in Berlin, was interested in an exact solution. He directed the author in the late autumn of 1959 to work on the problem. Why did these pre-Kerr attempts fail? Comments based on personal reminiscences and old notes.",Human
"In this article, we develop a classical electrodynamic theory to study the optical nonlinearities of metallic nanoparticles. The quasi-free electrons inside the metal are approximated as a classical Coulomb-interacting electron gas, and their motion under the excitation of an external electromagnetic field is described by the plasma equations. This theory is further tailored to study second-harmonic generation. Through detailed experiment-theory comparisons, we validate this classical theory as well as the associated numerical algorithm. It is demonstrated that our theory not only provides qualitative agreement with experiments, it also reproduces the overall strength of the experimentally observed second-harmonic signals.",Human
"We report on light-shift tomography of a cloud of 87 Rb atoms in a far-detuned optical-dipole trap at 1565 nm. Our method is based on standard absorption imaging, but takes advantage of the strong light-shift of the excited state of the imaging transition, which is due to a quasi-resonance of the trapping laser with a higher excited level. We use this method to (i) map the equipotentials of a crossed optical-dipole trap, and (ii) study the thermalisation of an atomic cloud by following the evolution of the potential-energy of atoms during the free-evaporation process.",Human
"The scattering of light and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) by finite arrays of either holes or dimples in a metal film is treated theoretically. A modal expansion formalism, capable of handling real metals with up to thousands of indentations, is presented. Computations based on this method demonstrate that a single hole scatters a significant fraction of incoming light into SPPs. It is also observed that holes and dimples scatter SPPs into light with similar efficiencies, provided the depth of the dimple is larger than its radius. Finally, it is shown that in arrays the normalized-to-area emittances in the out-of-plane and SPP channels present different dependences with the number of holes.",Human
"SIDE (Super Ifu Deployable Experiment) is proposed as second-generation, common-user instrument for the GTC. It will be a low and intermediate resolution fiber fed spectrograph, highly efficient in multi-object and 3D spectroscopy. The low resolution part (R = 1500, 4000) is called Dual VIS-NIR because it will observe in the VIS and NIR bands (0.4 ~V 1.7 microns) simultaneously. Because of the large number of fibers, a set of ~10 identical spectrographs is needed, each with a mirror collimator, a dichroic and two refractive cameras. The cameras are optimized for 0.4 - 0.95 microns (VIS) and 0.95 - 1.7 microns (NIR) respectively.",Human
"In this paper, we are interested in the transition between regimes here either visco-thermal or multiple scattering effects dominate for the propagation of acoustic waves through a 2D regular square array of rigid cylinders embedded in air. An extension of the numerical method using Schl\""omilch series is performed in order to account for visco-thermal losses. Comparison withexperimental data and results from classical homogenization theory allows to study the transition between a low frequency limit (where viscous and thermal effects dominate) and a high frequency regime (where multiple scattering effects become predominant). For this particular geometry, a large frequency domain where visco-thermal and multiple scattering effects coexist is found.",Human
"An important aspect that must be considered when studying opinion formation phenomena is the different social attitude of the agents taking part in the process. Different kinds of interconnections and of interacting behaviours should be associated to the agents depending on their opinion: radicals tend to self-segregate but, on the other hand, have a stronger capacity to convince neutral agents. Other important questions arise when the official media strongly promotes one position. The different perception that each agent has of the official information can lead, in case of monopolistic and aggressive media, to a reaction effect in the population that starts to create massive antagonist clusters.",Human
"We address the estimation of the loss parameter of a bosonic channel probed by arbitrary signals. Unlike the optimal Gaussian probes, which can attain the ultimate bound on precision asymptotically either for very small or very large losses, we prove that Fock states at any fixed photon number saturate the bound unconditionally for any value of the loss. In the relevant regime of low-energy probes, we demonstrate that superpositions of the first low-lying Fock states yield an absolute improvement over any Gaussian probe. Such few-photon states can be recast quite generally as truncations of de-Gaussified photon-subtracted states.",Human
The recent new structure of benzene shows that it consists of three C atoms of radii as in graphite alternating with three C atoms with double bond radii. This is different from the hypothetical cyclohexatriene (Kekule structure) involving alternate double and single bonds. It was shown that the difference in the bond energy sum of the atomic structure of benzene from that of the Kekule structure is the energy (erroneously) assumed to be due to resonance. Here it is shown that the present structure of benzene also explains the energy of hydrogenation into cyclohexane and its difference from that of cyclohexatriene.,Human
"We analyze second-order $M1$-$M1$ and $M1$-$E2$ effects to the hyperfine structure (HFS) of the lowest energy $P$ states of alkali-metal atoms arising from the coupling of the two ($J=1/2,3/2$) fine-structure levels through the hyperfine interaction. We find these effects to be especially sizable in Li, leading to a $9\sigma$ correction to the most accurate reported experimental value of the $A(P_{1/2})$ HFS constant of $^7$Li [D. Das and V. Natarajan, J. Phys. B \textbf{41}, 035001 (2008)]. For the remaining alkali-metal systems, the results tabulated within may be referenced as higher precision is sought in experimental determination of the HFS constants.",Human
"The coordinate transformation method is applied to bounded domains to design metamaterial devices for steering spatially confined electromagnetic fields. Both waveguide and free-space beam applications are considered as these are analogous within the present approach. In particular, we describe devices that bend the propagation direction and squeeze confined electromagnetic fields. Two approaches in non-magnetic realization of these structures are examined. The first is based on using a reduced set of material parameters, and the second on finding non-magnetic transformation media. It is shown that transverse-magnetic fields can be bent or squeezed to an arbitrary extent and without reflection using only dielectric structures.",Human
"The fast spinning B-star Regulus has recently been found to be orbited by a fainter companion in a close circular path with orbital period P_b = 40.11(2) d. Being its equatorial radius R_e 32% larger than the polar one R_p, Regulus possesses a remarkable quadrupole mass moment Q. We investigate the effects of Q on the orbital period P_b of its companion in order to see if they are measurable, given the present-day level of accuracy in measuring P_b. Conversely, we will look for deviations from the third Kepler law, attributed to the quadrupole mass moment Q of Regulus, to constrain the ratio \gamma=m/M of the system's masses.",Human
"We propose a model of evolutionary snowdrift game with $N$-person interactions and study the effects of multi-person interactions on the emergence of cooperation. An exact $N$-th-order equation for the equilibrium density of cooperators $x^*$ is derived for a well-mixed population using the approach of replicator dynamics. The results show that the extent of cooperation drops with increasing cost-to-benefit ratio and the number $N$ of interaction persons in a group, with $x^{*}\sim1/N$ for large $N$. An algorithm for numerical simulations is constructed for the model. The simulation results are in good agreements with theoretical results of the replicator dynamics.",Human
"In December 1907, Minkowski expressed the Maxwell equations in the very beautiful and compact 4-dimensional form: lor f=-s, lor F^*=0. Here `lor', an abbreviation of Lorentz, represents the 4-dimensional differential operator. We study Minkowski's derivation and show how these equations generalize to their modern premetric form in the framework of tensor and exterior calculus (valid also in general relativity). After mentioning some applications of premetric electrodynamics, we turn to Minkowski's discovery of the energy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field. We discuss how he arrived at it and how its premetric formulation looks like.",Human
"In this paper, I study the diffusion of new terms, called neologism, in social networks. I consider it as an example of information dynamics on networks and I hope that solving this problem can help us to understand and describe the information dynamics problem. To do so I develop a phenomenological model for the diffusion mechanism. I find an analytical relationship between number of people in the society who has learned the term and time taken. The Network parameters are imported in this analytical solution. I also present some simulation for this mechanism for several sample and some real networks which confirms the analytical results. In addition, I study the effects of network topology on diffusion process.",Human
We apply the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm to the financial time sires analysis of the stochastic volatility (SV) model for the first time. The HMC algorithm is used for the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) update of volatility variables of the SV model in the Bayesian inference. We compute parameters of the SV model from the artificial financial data and compare the results from the HMC algorithm with those from the Metropolis algorithm. We find that the HMC decorrelates the volatility variables faster than the Metropolis algorithm. We also make an empirical analysis based on the Yen/Dollar exchange rates.,Human
"Complex systems research is becomingly increasingly data-driven, particularly in the social and biological domains. Many of the systems from which sample data are collected feature structural heterogeneity at the mesoscopic scale (i.e. communities) and limited inter-community diffusion. Here we show that the interplay between these two features can yield a significant bias in the global characteristics inferred from the data. We present a general framework to quantify this bias, and derive an explicit corrective factor for a wide class of systems. Applying our analysis to a recent high-profile survey of conflict mortality in Iraq suggests a significant overestimate of deaths.",Human
"A comprehensive modeling and simulation study of the first-order isotropic/smectic-A transition is presented and applied to phase diagram computation and two-dimensional spherulite growth. An approach based on nonlinear optimization, that incorporates experimental data (from 12CB, dodecyl-cyanobiphenyl), is used to determine physically realistic model parameters. These parameters are then used in conjunction with an optimized phase diagram computation method. Additionally, a time-dependent formulation is presented and applied to the study of two-dimensional smectic-A spherulite growth. These results show the growth kinematics and defect dynamics of nanoscale smectic-A spherulite growth in an isotropic phase with an initially radial layer configuration.",Human
The drying dynamics in three dimensional porous media are studied with confocal microscopy. We observe abrupt air invasions in size from single particle to hundreds of particles. We show that these result from the strong flow from menisci in large pores to menisci in small pores during drying. This flow causes air invasions to start in large menisci and subsequently spread throughout the entire system. We measure the size and structure of the air invasions and show that they are in accord with invasion percolation. By varying the particle size and contact angle we unambiguously demonstrate that capillary pressure dominates the drying process.,Human
"Present routes to produce magnetic organic-based materials adopt a common strategy: the use of magnetic species (atoms, polyradicals, etc.) as building blocks. We explore an alternative approach which consists of selective hydrogenation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Self-Consistent-Field (SCF) (Hartree-Fock and DFT) and multi-configurational (CISD and MCSCF) calculations on coronene and corannulene, both hexa-hydrogenated, show that the formation of stable high spin species is possible. The spin of the ground states is discussed in terms of the Hund rule and Lieb's theorem for bipartite lattices (alternant hydrocarbons in this case). This proposal opens a new door to magnetism in the organic world.",Human
"Dispersive Fourier transformation is a powerful technique in which the spectrum of an optical pulse is mapped into a time-domain waveform using chromatic dispersion. It replaces a diffraction grating and detector array with a dispersive fiber and single photodetector. This simplifies the system and, more importantly, enables fast real-time measurements. Here we describe a novel ultrafast barcode reader and displacement sensor that employs internally-amplified dispersive Fourier transformation. This technique amplifies and simultaneously maps the spectrally encoded barcode into a temporal waveform. It achieves a record acquisition speed of 25 MHz -- four orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art.",Human
"In the present paper, the connection between surface order-disorder phase transitions and the percolating properties of the adsorbed phase has been studied. For this purpose, four lattice-gas models in presence of repulsive interactions have been considered. Namely, monomers on honeycomb, square and triangular lattices, and dimers (particles occupying two adjacent adsorption sites) on square substrates. By using Monte Carlo simulation and finite-size scaling analysis, we obtain the percolation threshold $\theta_c$ of the adlayer, which presents an interesting dependence with $w/k_BT$ (being $w$, $k_B$ and $T$, the lateral interaction energy, the Boltzmann's constant and temperature, respectively). For each geometry and adsorbate size, a phase diagram separating a percolating and a non-percolating region is determined.",Human
"Nowadays, scaling methods for general large-scale complex networks have been developed. We proposed a new scaling scheme called ""two-site scaling"". This scheme was applied iteratively to various networks, and we observed how the degree distribution of the network changes by two-site scaling. In particular, networks constructed by the BA algorithm behave differently from the networks observed in the nature. In addition, an iterative scaling scheme can define a new renormalizing method. We investigated the possibility of defining the Wilsonian renormalization group method on general complex networks and its application to the analysis of the dynamics of complex networks.",Human
"The alignment of tracking detectors is crucial for the physics programme at the LHC, especially for precision measurements like the W mass. The alignment of the ATLAS silicon tracking detectors with a total of 5832 modules poses an unprecedented challenge. In this poster, two track-based alignment algorithms at ATLAS will be covered: the Global chi^2 Algorithm based on chi^2 minimisation, and the Robust Alignment Algorithm based on centering residual distributions. On a time scale of minutes and hours, the geometry of the silicon tracking detectors can be monitored with the Frequency Scanning Interferometry system. An overview of this system will also be given.",Human
"We define a minimal model of traffic flows in complex networks containing the most relevant features of real routing schemes, i.e. a trade--off strategy between topological-based and traffic-based routing. The resulting collective behavior, obtained analytically for the ensemble of uncorrelated networks, is physically very rich and reproduces results recently observed in traffic simulations on scale-free networks. We find that traffic control is useless in homogeneous graphs but may improves global performance in inhomogeneous networks, enlarging the free-flow region in parameter space. Traffic control also introduces non-linear effects and, beyond a critical strength, may trigger the appearance of a congested phase in a discontinuous manner.",Human
"In analyzing synthetic earthquake catalogs created by a two-dimensional Burridge-Knopoff model, we have found that a probability distribution of the interoccurrence times, the time intervals between successive events, can be described clearly by the superposition of the Weibull distribution and the log-Weibull distribution. In addition, the interoccurrence time statistics depend on frictional properties and stiffness of a fault and exhibit the Weibull - log Weibull transition, which states that the distribution function changes from the log-Weibull regime to the Weibull regime when the threshold of magnitude is increased. We reinforce a new insight into this model; the model can be recognized as a mechanical model providing a framework of the Weibull - log Weibull transition.",Human
"We point out that by comparing the total mass (in gravitational units) of the earth-moon system, as determined by lunar laser ranging, with the sum of the lunar mass as independently determined by its gravitational action on satellites or asteroids, and the earth mass, as determined by the LAGEOS geodetic survey satellite, one can get a direct measure of the mass of earth-bound dark matter lying between the radius of the moon's orbit and the geodetic satellite orbit. Current data show that the mass of such earth-bound dark matter must be less than $4 \times 10^{-9}$ of the earth's mass.",Human
"Optics-less cutaneous (skin) vision is not rare among living organisms, though its mechanisms and capabilities have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper demonstrates, using methods from statistical parameter estimation theory and numerical simulations, that an array of bare sensors with a natural cosine-law angular sensitivity arranged on a flat or curved surface has the ability to perform imaging tasks without any optics at all. The working principle of this type of optics-less sensor and the model developed here for determining sensor performance may be used to shed light upon possible mechanisms and capabilities of cutaneous vision in nature.",Human
"A new family of radiation sensors is introduced which do not require any optics. The sensors consist of arrays of elementary sub-sensors with natural cosine-law or similar angular sensitivity supplemented with a signal processing unit that computes optimal statistical estimations of source parameters. We show, both theoretically and by computer simulation, that such sensors are capable of accurate localization and intensity estimation of a given number of radiation sources and of imaging of a given number of sources in known positions. The accuracy is found to be dependent only on the sub-sensors noise level, on the number of sub-sensors and on the spacing between radiation sources.",Human
"We demonstrate that the addition of a single carbon impurity leads to significant changes in the thermodynamic properties of Ni clusters consisting of more than a hundred atoms. The magnitude of the change induced is dependent upon the parameters of the Ni-C interaction. Hence, thermodynamic properties of Ni clusters can be effectively tuned by the addition of an impurity of a particular type. We also show that the presence of a carbon impurity considerably changes the mobility and diffusion of atoms in the Ni cluster at temperatures close to its melting point. The calculated diffusion coefficients of the carbon impurity in the Ni cluster can be used for a reliable estimate of the growth rate of carbon nanotubes.",Human
"A new analytically and numerically manageable model collision operator is developed specifically for turbulence simulations. The like-particle collision operator includes both pitch-angle scattering and energy diffusion and satisfies the physical constraints required for collision operators: it conserves particles, momentum and energy, obeys Boltzmann's H-theorem (collisions cannot decrease entropy), vanishes on a Maxwellian, and efficiently dissipates small-scale structure in the velocity space. The process of transforming this collision operator into the gyroaveraged form for use in gyrokinetic simulations is detailed. The gyroaveraged model operator is shown to have more suitable behavior at small scales in phase space than previously suggested models. A model operator for electron-ion collisions is also presented.",Human
"Lie symmetry analysis is applied to study the nonlinear rotating shallow water equations. The 9-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries admitted by the model is found. It is shown that the rotating shallow water equations are related with the classical shallow water model with the change of variables. The derived symmetries are used to generate new exact solutions of the rotating shallow equations. In particular, a new class of time-periodic solutions with quasi-closed particle trajectories is constructed and studied. The symmetry reduction method is also used to obtain some invariant solutions of the model. Examples of these solutions are presented with a brief physical interpretation.",Human
"Inspired by the recent literature on aggregation theory, we aim at relating the long range correlation of the stocks return volatility to the heterogeneity of the investors' expectations about the level of the future volatility. Based on a semi-parametric model of investors' anticipations, we make the connection between the distributional properties of the heterogeneity parameters and the auto-covariance/auto-correlation functions of the realized volatility. We report different behaviors, or change of convention, whose observation depends on the market phase under consideration. In particular, we report and justify the fact that the volatility exhibits significantly longer memory during the phases of speculative bubble than during the phase of recovery following the collapse of a speculative bubble.",Human
"We theoretically investigate the transmission of electromagnetic radiation through a metal plate with a zero-$\epsilon$ metamaterial slit, where the permittivity tends towards zero over a given bandwidth. Our analytic results demonstrate that the transmission coefficient can be substantial for a broad range of slit geometries, including subwavelength widths that are many wavelengths long. This novel resonant effect has features quite unlike the Fabry-P\'{e}rot-like resonances that have been observed in conductors with deep channels. We further reveal that these high impedance ultranarrow zero-$\epsilon$ channels can have significantly {\it greater} transmission compared to slits with no wave impedance difference across them.",Human
"The Earth's preseismic oscillating (T = 24h) electric field recorded for a short-time period of some days is analyzed in terms of its intensity vector azimuthal direction calculated at one monitoring site. The calculated azimuthal directions are compared to the concurrent seismicity observed for the same period of time. Examples are presented for proving the agreement between the electric field intensity vectors calculated azimuths and the corresponding ones referring to the EQs - monitoring site location. Finally, an example is presented on account of the use of this methodology upon three different monitoring sites for the utilization of the estimation of the epicentral area of a large future EQ at the Methoni, Greece seismogenic area.",Human
"We define and measure the ratio (R) of the vector ac-Stark effect (or light shift) in the 6S_1/2 and 5D_3/2 states of a single trapped barium ion to 0.2% accuracy at two different off-resonant wavelengths. We earlier found R = -11.494(13) at 514.531nm and now report the value at 1111.68nm, R = +0.4176(8). These observations together yield a value of the <5D||er||4F> matrix element, previously unknown in the literature. Also, comparison of our results with an ab initio calculation of dynamic polarizability would yield a new test of atomic theory and improve the understanding of atomic structure needed to interpret a proposed atomic parity violation experiment.",Human
"We show in this paper that third- and fourth-order low storage Runge-Kutta algorithms can be built specifically for quadratic nonlinear operators, at the expense of roughly doubling the time needed for evaluating the temporal derivatives. The resulting algorithms are especially well suited for computational fluid dynamics. Examples are given for the H\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonian system and, in one and two space dimensions, for the Burgers equation using both a pseudo-spectral code and a spectral element code, respectively. The scheme is also shown to be practical in three space solving the incompressible Euler equation using a fully parallelized pseudo-spectral code.",Human
"High peak power ultrafast lasers are widely used in nonlinear spectroscopy but often limit its spectral resolution because of the broad frequency bandwidth of ultrashort laser pulses. Improving the resolution by achieving spectrally narrow excitation of, or emission from, the resonant medium by means of multi-photon interferences has been the focus of many recent developments in ultrafast spectroscopy. We demonstrate an alternative approach, in which high resolution is exercised by detecting narrow spectral correlations between broadband excitation and emission optical fields. All-optical correlation analysis, easily incorporated into the traditional spectroscopic setup, enables direct, robust and simultaneous detection of multiple narrow resonances with a single femtosecond pulse.",Human
"In this paper, the mechanism of fault pressurization in rapid slip events is analyzed on the basis of a complete characterization of the thermo-poro-mechanical behavior of a clayey gouge extracted at 760m depth in Aigion fault in the active seismic zone of the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. It is shown that the thermally collapsible character of this clayey gouge can be responsible for a dramatic reduction of effective stress and a full fluidization of the material. The thickness of the 'ultra localized' zone of highly strained material is a key parameter that controls the competing phenomena of pore pressure increase leading to fluidization of the fault gouge and temperature increase leading to pore fluid vaporization.",Human
"Exchange interaction strongly influences the long-range behaviour of localised electron orbitals. It violates the oscillation theorem (creates extra nodes) and produces a power-law decay instead of the usual exponential decrease at large distances. For inner orbitals inside molecules decay is 1/r^2, for macroscopic systems cos(k_f r)/r^n, where k_f is the Fermi momentum and n=3 for 1D, n=3.5 for 2D and n=4 for 3D crystal. Slow decay increases the exchange interaction between localised spins and the under-barrier tunneling amplitude.The under-barrier transmission coefficients in solids (e.g. for point contacts) become temperature-dependent.",Human
"In this article, we present two different parallel Swendsen-Wang Cluster(SWC) algorithms using message-passing interface(MPI). One is based on Master-Slave Parallel Model(MSPM) and the other is based on Data-Parallel Model(DPM). A speedup of 24 with 40 processors and 16 with 37 processors is achieved with the DPM and MSPM respectively. The speedup of both algorithms at different temperature and system size is carefully examined both experimentally and theoretically, and a comparison of their efficiency is made. In the last section, based on these two parallel SWC algorithms, two parallel probability changing cluster(PCC) algorithms are proposed.",Human
"A constructive approach to theory of diffusion processes is proposed, which is based on application of both the symmetry analysis and method of modelling functions. An algorithm for construction of the modelling functions is suggested. This algorithm is based on the error functions expansion (ERFEX) of experimental concentration profiles. The high-accuracy analytical description of the profiles provided by ERFEX approximation allows a convenient extraction of the concentration dependence of diffusivity from experimental data and prediction of the diffusion process. Our analysis is exemplified by its employment to experimental results obtained for surface diffusion of lithium on the molybdenum (112) surface pre-covered with dysprosium. The ERFEX approximation can be directly extended to many other diffusion systems.",Human
"Self-similarity is a property of fractal structures, a concept introduced by Mandelbrot and one of the fundamental mathematical results of the 20th century. The importance of fractal geometry stems from the fact that these structures were recognized in numerous examples in Nature, from the coexistence of liquid/gas at the critical point of evaporation of water, to snowflakes, to the tortuous coastline of the Norwegian fjords, to the behavior of many complex systems such as economic data, or the complex patterns of human agglomeration. Here we review the recent advances in self-similarity of complex networks and its relation to transport, diffusion, percolations and other topological properties such us degree distribution, modularity, and degree-degree correlations.",Human
A particular discrete rhombohedral lattice consisting of four symmetrically interlaced cuboctahedral point lattices is described that is interesting because of the high degree of symmetry it exhibits. The four constituent cuboctahedral lattices are denoted by four colours and the composite lattice is referred to as a 4-colour rhombohedral lattice. Each point of the 4-colour lattice can be referenced by an integer 4-tuple containing only the positive non-zero integers (the counting numbers). The relationship between the discrete rhombohedral lattice and a discrete Cartesian lattice is explained. Some interesting aspects of the lattice and of the counting-number 4-tuple coordinate system are pointed out.,Human
"The evolution of the phase space density of particle beams in external fields is found proceeding from the continuity equation in the six-dimensional (6D) phase space (mu-space). The Robinson theorem, which includes the Liouville theorem as a special case, was proved in a more simple and consistent alternative way valid for arbitrary external fields, averaged fields of the beam (self-generated electro-magnetic fields except intrabeam scattering) and arbitrary frictional forces (linear, nonlinear). It includes particle accelerators as a special case. The limits of the applicability of the Robinson theorem in case of cooling of excited ions having a finite living time are presented.",Human
"The helical magnetorotational instability of the magnetized Taylor-Couette flow is studied numerically in a finite cylinder. A distant upstream insulating boundary is shown to stabilize the convective instability entirely while reducing the growth rate of the absolute instability. The reduction is less severe with larger height. After modeling the boundary conditions properly, the wave patterns observed in the experiment turn out to be a noise-sustained convective instability. After the source of the noise resulted from unstable Ekman and Stewartson layers is switched off, a slowly-decaying inertial oscillation is observed in the simulation. We reach the conclusion that the experiments completed to date have not yet reached the regime of absolute instability.",Human
"This paper presents a new line element based on the assumption of the variable rest mass in gravitational field, and explores some its implications. This line element is not a vacuum solution of Einstein's equations, yet it is sufficiently close to Schwarzschild's line element to be compatible with all of the experimental and observational measurements made so far to confirm the three Einstein's predictions. The theory allows radiation and fast particles to escape from all massive bodies, even from those that in Einstein's general relativity framework will be black holes. The striking feature of this line element is the non-existence of black holes.",Human

"Recommender systems use data on past user preferences to predict possible future likes and interests. A key challenge is that while the most useful individual recommendations are to be found among diverse niche objects, the most reliably accurate results are obtained by methods that recommend objects based on user or object similarity. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm specifically to address the challenge of diversity and show how it can be used to resolve this apparent dilemma when combined in an elegant hybrid with an accuracy-focused algorithm. By tuning the hybrid appropriately we are able to obtain, without relying on any semantic or context-specific information, simultaneous gains in both accuracy and diversity of recommendations.",Human
"We have studied interoccurrence time distributions by analyzing the synthetic and three natural catalogs of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC), and Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (TCWB) and revealed the universal feature of the interoccurrence time statistics, Weibull - log Weibull transition. This transition reinforces the view that the interoccurrence time statistics possess Weibull statistics and log-Weibull statistics. Here in this paper, the crossover magnitude from the superposition regime to the Weibull regime $m_c^2$ is proportional to the plate velocity. In addition, we have found the region-independent relation, $m_c^2/m_{max} = 0.54 \pm 0.004$.",Human
"We report the optical and dielectric properties in hafnium (Hf)-doped lithium niobate (LN) crystals. We investigated samples of congruent composition with various doping concentration varying from 0 to 8 mol%. The clamped and unclamped values of the electro-optic coefficient r 22 of Hf-doped LN and the corresponding dielectric permittivity as well, have been experimentally determined and compared with the results obtained in undoped congruent LN crystals. We show that the electro-optic and dielectric properties are only slightly affected by the introduction of hafnium ions, and therefore Hf-doped LN has the advantage of low photorefractive damage compared with the undoped congruent LN.",Human
We theoretically evaluate changes in the magnetic potential arising from the magnetic field near superconducting thin films. An example of an atom chip based on a three-wire configuration has been simulated in the superconducting and the normal conducting state. Inhomogeneous current densities within the superconducting wires were calculated using an energy-minimization routine based on the London theory. The Meissner effect causes changes to both trap position and oscillation frequencies at short distances from the superconducting surface. Superconducting wires produce much shallower micro traps than normal conducting wires. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the importance of taking the Meissner effect into account when designing and carrying out experiments on magnetically trapped neutral atoms near superconducting surfaces.,Human
"We show that quantum coherence of biomolecular excitons is maintained over exceedingly long times due to the constructive role of their non-Markovian protein-solvent environment. Using a numerically exact approach, we demonstrate that a slow quantum bath helps to sustain quantum entanglement of two pairs of Forster coupled excitons, in contrast to a Markovian environment. We consider the crossover from a fast to a slow bath and from weak to strong dissipation and show that a slow bath can generate robust entanglement. This persists to surprisingly high temperatures, even higher than the excitonic gap and is absent for a Markovian bath.",Human
"We report on the realization and characterization of a magnetic microtrap for ultra cold atoms near a straight superconducting Nb wire with circular cross section. The trapped atoms are used to probe the magnetic field outside the superconducting wire. The Meissner effect shortens the distance between the trap and the wire, reduces the radial magnetic-field gradients and lowers the trap depth. Measurements of the trap position reveal a complete exclusion of the magnetic field from the superconducting wire for temperatures lower than 6K. As the temperature is further increased, the magnetic field partially penetrates the superconducting wire; hence the microtrap position is shifted towards the position expected for a normal-conducting wire.",Human
"We generalize and test the recent ""ab initio"" self-consistent (AISC) time-independent semiclassical laser theory. This self-consistent formalism generates all the stationary lasing properties in the multimode regime (frequencies, thresholds, internal and external fields, output power and emission pattern) from simple inputs: the dielectric function of the passive cavity, the atomic transition frequency, and the transverse relaxation time of the lasing transition. We find that the theory gives excellent quantitative agreement with full time-dependent simulations of the Maxwell-Bloch equations after it has been generalized to drop the slowly-varying envelope approximation. The theory is infinite order in the non-linear hole-burning interaction; the widely used third order approximation is shown to fail badly.",Human
"The Beijing Electron Collider has been upgraded (BEPCII) to a two-ring collider with a design luminosity of $1 \times 10^{33}$cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at a center-of-mass energy of 3.78 GeV. It will operate between 2 and 4.6 GeV in the center of mass. With this luminosity, the BESIII detector will be able to collect, for example, 10 billion $J/\psi$ events in one year of running. This will be a unique facility in the world opening many physics opportunities. BEPCII and BESIII are both currently being commissioned, first events have been obtained, and data taking will take place in fall 2008.",Human
"Sex is considered as an evolutionary paradox, since its evolutionary advantage does not necessarily overcome the two fold cost of sharing half of one's offspring's genome with another member of the population. Here we demonstrate that sexual reproduction can be evolutionary stable even when its Darwinian fitness is twice as low when compared to the fitness of asexual mutants. We also show that more than two sexes are always evolutionary unstable. Our approach generalizes the evolutionary game theory to analyze species whose members are able to sense the sexual state of their conspecifics and to switch sexes consequently. The widespread emergence and maintenance of sex follows therefore from its co-evolution with even more widespread environmental sensing abilities.",Human
"We propose a new approach for properly analyzing stochastic time series by mapping the dynamics of time series fluctuations onto a suitable nonequilibrium surface-growth problem. In this framework, the fluctuation sampling time interval plays the role of time variable, whereas the physical time is treated as the analog of spatial variable. In this way we found that the fluctuations of many real-world time series satisfy the analog of the Family-Viscek dynamic scaling ansatz. This finding permits to use the powerful tools of kinetic roughening theory to classify, model, and forecast the fluctuations of real-world time series.",Human
"Unexplained periodic fluctuations in the decay rates of Si-32 and Ra-226 have been reported by groups at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Si-32), and at the Physikalisch-Technische-Bundesandstalt in Germany (Ra-226). We show from an analysis of the raw data in these experiments that the observed fluctuations are strongly correlated in time, not only with each other, but also with the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Some implications of these results are also discussed, including the suggestion that discrepancies in published half-life determinations for these and other nuclides may be attributable in part to differences in solar activity during the course of the various experiments, or to seasonal variations in fundamental constants.",Human
"The asymmetric time dependence and various statistical properties of polarity reversals of the Earth's magnetic field are utilized to infer some of the most essential parameters of the geodynamo, among them the effective (turbulent) magnetic diffusivity, the degree of supercriticality, and the relative strength of the periodic forcing which is believed to result from the Milankovic cycle of the Earth's orbit eccentricity. A time-stepped spherically symmetric alpha^2-dynamo model is used as the kernel of an inverse problem solver in form of a downhill simplex method which converges to solutions that yield a stunning correspondence with paleomagnetic data.",Human
"Basic peculiarities of market price fluctuations are known to be well described by a recently developed random walk model in a temporally deforming quadric potential force whose center is given by a moving average of past price traces [Physica A 370, pp91-97, 2006]. By analyzing high-frequency financial time series of exceptional events such as bubbles and crashes, we confirm the appearance of nonlinear potential force in the markets. We show statistical significance of its existence by applying the information criterion. This new time series analysis is expected to be applied widely for detecting a non-stationary symptom in random phenomena.",Human
"We apply statistical physics to study the task of resource allocation in random sparse networks with limited bandwidths for the transportation of resources along the links. Useful algorithms are obtained from recursive relations. Bottlenecks emerge when the bandwidths are small, causing an increase in the fraction of idle links. For a given total bandwidth per node, the efficiency of allocation increases with the network connectivity. In the high connectivity limit, we find a phase transition at a critical bandwidth, above which clusters of balanced nodes appear, characterised by a profile of homogenized resource allocation similar to the Maxwell's construction.",Human
"We have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) running in Matlab, called Weighted-Interaction Nestedness Estimator, WINE (Fig. 1). WINE is a Matlab application developed to perform the calculation of the new weighted nestedness estimator. This program allows the user to: open a data file, select the range of data to be analysed, and calculate the results, obtaining two graphics and three indices. The indices shown in the graphical interface are: a) weighted nestedness of the frequency matrix, b) average weighted nestedness of 100 random matrices of similar characteristics, and c) the new weighted- interaction nestedness estimator, which compares the two previous results.",Human
"We propose a general method to evaluate the material parameters for arbitrary shape transformation media. By solving the original coordinates in the transformed region via Laplace's equations, we can obtain the deformation field numerically, in turn the material properties of the devices to be designed such as cloaks, rotators or concentrators with arbitrary shape. Devices which have non-fixed outer boundaries, such as beam guider, can also be designed by the proposed method. Examples with full wave simulation are given for illustration. In the end, wave velocity and energy change in the transformation media are discussed with help of the deformation view.",Human
"The shape of a weightless spinning liquid droplet is governed by the balance between the surface tension and centrifugal forces. The axisymmetric shape for slow rotation becomes unstable to a non-axisymmetric distortion above a critical angular velocity, beyond which the droplet progresses through a series of 2-lobed shapes. Theory predicts the existence of a family of 3- and 4-lobed equilibrium shapes at higher angular velocity. We investigate the formation of a triangular-shaped magnetically levitated water droplet, driven to rotate by the Lorentz force on an ionic current within the droplet. We also study equatorial traveling waves which give the droplet 3, 4 and 5-fold symmetry.",Human
"In this Letter, we introduce a modified collaborative filtering (MCF) algorithm, which has remarkably higher accuracy than the standard collaborative filtering. In the MCF, instead of the standard Pearson coefficient, the user-user similarities are obtained by a diffusion process. Furthermore, by considering the second order similarities, we design an effective algorithm that depresses the influence of mainstream preferences. The corresponding algorithmic accuracy, measured by the ranking score, is further improved by 24.9% in the optimal case. In addition, two significant criteria of algorithmic performance, diversity and popularity, are also taken into account. Numerical results show that the algorithm based on second order similarity can outperform the MCF simultaneously in all three criteria.",Human
"In many applications sampled data are collected in irregular fashion or are partly lost or unavailable. In these cases it is required to convert irregularly sampled signals to regularly sampled ones or to restore missing data. In this paper, we address this problem in a framework of a discrete sampling theorem for band-limited discrete signals that have a limited number of non-zero transform coefficients in a certain transform domain. Conditions for the image unique recovery, from sparse samples, are formulated and then analyzed for various transforms. Applications are demonstrated on examples of image super-resolution and image reconstruction from sparse projections.",Human
"We present a new technique for pixel hit reconstruction with the CMS pixel detector. The technique is based on fitting the pixel cluster projections to templates obtained using a detailed simulation called Pixelav. Pixelav successfully describes the profiles of clusters measured in beam tests of radiation-damaged sensors. Originally developed to optimally estimate the coordinates of hits after the radiation damage, the technique has superior performance before irradiation as well, reducing the resolution tails of reconstructed track parameters and significantly reducing the light quark background of tagged b-quarks. It is the only technique currently available to simulate hits from a radiation-damaged detector.",Human
"Spatially-smoothed sources are often utilized in the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method to suppress the associated aliasing errors to levels as low as possible. In this work, the explicit conditions of the optimal source patterns for these spanning sources are presented based on the fact that the aliasing errors are mainly attributed to the high spatial-frequency parts of the time-stepped source items and subsequently demonstrated to be exactly corresponding to the normalized rows of Pascal's triangle. The outstanding performance of these optimal sources is verified by the practical 1-D, 2-D and 3-D PSTD simulations and compared with that of non-optimal sources.",Human
"By means of a time-of-flight technique, we measured the longitudinal profile of prompt $\gamma$-rays emitted by 73 MeV/u $^{13}$C ions irradiating a PMMA target. This technique allowed us to minimize the shielding against neutrons and scattered $\gamma$-rays, and to correlate prompt gamma emission to the ion path. This correlation, together with a high counting rate, paves the way toward real-time monitoring of the longitudinal dose profile during ion therapy treatments. Moreover, the time correlation between the prompt gamma detection and the transverse position of the incident ions measured by a beam monitor can provide real-time 3D control of the irradiation.",Human
We present a numerical investigation of the Brownian motion and diffusion of a dumbbell in a two-dimensional periodic potential. Its dynamics is described by a Langevin model including the hydrodynamic interaction. With increasing values of the amplitude of the potential we find along the modulated spatial directions a reduction of the diffusion constant and of the impact of the hydrodynamic interaction. For modulation amplitudes of the potential in the range of the thermal energy the dumbbell diffusion exhibits a pronounced local maximum at a wavelength of about 3/2 of the dumbbell extension. This is especially emphasized for stiff springs connecting the two beads.,Human
The breakup of high-order spatial solitons propagating in an AlGaAs slab waveguide is studied. We experimentally observe the breakup of such beams into multiple fragments and identify the mechanism of this breakup as the combined effect of two- and three-photon-absorption. We show that the multiple breakup persists even when the value of two-photon-absorption is reduced by an order of magnitude owing to the high value of three-photon-absorption of AlGaAs at the half band-gap. The experimental results extend known mechanism of soliton breakup induced by two-photon-absorption and agree well with numerical beam propagation simulations.,Human
We define a normalized impact factor suitable to assess in a simple way both the strength of scientific communities and the research influence of individuals. We define those ones with $NIF \geq 1$ as being scientific leaders since they would influence their peers at least as much as they are influenced by them. The NIF is distinguished because (a) this has a clear and universal meaning being applicable with equal efficiency to individuals belonging to scientific communities with quite different publication and citation traditions and (b) this is robust against self-citation expedient. This is eventually applied to a community derived from the list of outstanding referees recognized by the American Physical Society in 2008.,Human
"Based on the synergetic equations and its application, we propose the equations on the rule of law. From these equations we may prove mathematically that a society of the rule of law cannot lack any aspect for three types of the legislation, the administration and the judicature. Otherwise, we propose an equation of corruption, and discuss quantitatively some threshold values for a system into corruption. Moreover, from synergetics we obtain the Lorenz model, which may be a visualized two-party mechanism as a type of stable structure in democracy. A developed direction of society should be the combination from macroscopic to microscopic order, from an actual capable handling to an ideal pursuance.",Human
"We introduce solvable stochastic dealer models, which can reproduce basic empirical laws of financial markets such as the power law of price change. Starting from the simplest model that is almost equivalent to a Poisson random noise generator, the model becomes fairly realistic by adding only two effects, the self-modulation of transaction intervals and a forecasting tendency, which uses a moving average of the latest market price changes. Based on the present microscopic model of markets, we find a quantitative relation with market potential forces, which has recently been discovered in the study of market price modeling based on random walks.",Human
"We propose, solve, and discuss a simple model for a metamaterial incorporating optical gain: A single bosonic resonance is coupled to a fermionic (inverted) two-level-system resonance via local-field interactions. For given steady-state inversion, this model can be solved analytically, revealing a rich variety of (Fano) absorption/gain lineshapes. We also give an analytic expression for the fixed inversion resulting from gain pinning under steady-state conditions. Furthermore, the dynamic response of the 'lasing SPASER', i.e., its relaxation oscillations, can be obtained by simple numerical calculations within the same model. As a result, this toy model can be viewed as the near-field-optical counterpart of the usual LASER rate equations.",Human
Isolated human buccal epithelium cell were irradiated by microwaves at frequency f=35 GHz and surface power density E=30 mcW/cm2. The state of chromatin in human cells was determined by methodsof light and electron microscopy. The state of cell membranes was evaluated by the method of vital indigo carmine staining. The microwave-induced condensation of chromatin in human cells was revealed. Left side circulary polarized waves induced less effect than linearly polarized radiation. The linearly polarized electromagnetic waves induced cell membrane damage revealed by the increase of cell stainability. The data obtained are discussed in connection with the mechanisms of biologica effect of electromagnetic waves.,Human
"The global atmospheric temperature anomalies of Earth reached a maximum in 1998 which has not been exceeded during the subsequent 10 years. The global anomalies are calculated from the average of climate effects occurring in the tropical and the extratropical latitude bands. El Nino/La Nina effects in the tropical band are shown to explain the 1998 maximum while variations in the background of the global anomalies largely come from climate effects in the northern extratropics. These effects do not have the signature associated with CO2 climate forcing. However, the data show a small underlying positive trend that is consistent with CO2 climate forcing with no-feedback.",Human
"Liquid drops can be kept from touching a plane solid surface by a gas stream entering from underneath, as it is observed for water drops on a heated plate, kept aloft by a stream of water vapor. We investigate the limit of small flow rates, for which the size of the gap between the drop and the substrate becomes very small. Above a critical drop radius no stationary drops can exist, below the critical radius two solutions coexist. However, only the solution with the smaller gap width is stable, the other is unstable. We compare to experimental data and use boundary integral simulations to show that unstable drops develop a gas ""chimney"" which breaks the drop in its middle.",Human
"We introduce an elementary model of a turbulent boundary layer over a flat surface, given as a vertical random distribution of spanwise Lamb-Oseen vortex configurations placed over a non-slip boundary condition line. We are able to reproduce several important features of realistic flows, such as the viscous and logarithmic boundary sublayers, and the general behavior of the first statistical moments (turbulent intensity, skewness and flatness) of the streamwise velocity fluctuations. As an application, we advance some heuristic considerations on the boundary layer underlying kinematics that could be associated with the phenomenon of drag reduction by polymers, finding a suggestive support from its experimental signatures.",Human
"The scaling properties of oil price fluctuations are described as a non-stationary stochastic process realized by a time series of finite length. An original model is used to extract the scaling exponent of the fluctuation functions within a non-stationary process formulation. It is shown that, when returns are measured over intervals less than 10 days, the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) exhibit self-similarity and monoscaling, in contrast to the multifractal behavior of the PDFs at macro-scales (typically larger than one month). We find that the time evolution of the distributions are well fitted by a Levy distribution law at micro-scales. The relevance of a Levy distribution is made plausible by a simple model of nonlinear transfer",Human
"The concept of matter wave radiation is put forward, and its equation is established for the first time. The formalism solution shows that the probability density is a function of displacement and time. A free particle and a two-level system are reinvestigated considering the effect of matter wave radiation. Three feasible experimental designs, especially a modified Stern-Gerlach setup, are proposed to verify the existence of matter wave radiation. Matter wave radiation effect in relativity has been formulated in only a raw formulae, which offers another explanation of Lamb shift. A possible mechanics of matter teleportation is predicted due to the effect of matter wave radiation.",Human
"A comparison is made of the traditional Loschmidt (reversibility) and Zermelo (recurrence) objections to Boltzmann's H-theorem, and its simplified variant in the Ehrenfests' 1912 wind-tree model. The little-cited 1896 (pre-recurrence) objection of Zermelo (similar to an 1889 argument due to Poincare) is also analysed. Significant differences between the objections are highlighted, and several old and modern misconceptions concerning both them and the H-theorem are clarified. We give particular emphasis to the radical nature of Poincare's and Zermelo's attack, and the importance of the shift in Boltzmann's thinking in response to the objections as a whole.",Human
"For a massless fluid (density = 0), the steady flow along a duct is governed exclusively by viscous losses. In this paper, we show that the velocity profile obtained in this limit can be used to calculate the pressure drop up to the first order in density. This method has been applied to the particular case of a duct, defined by two plane-parallel discs. For this case, the first-order approximation results in a simple analytical solution which has been favorably checked against numerical simulations. Finally, an experiment has been carried out with water flowing between the discs. The experimental results show good agreement with the approximate solution.",Human
"We show conditions for HFGW detection, employing an entropy concept written up by Jack Ng, and Steinhard's proceedure for reconstructing tensorial representations for relic HFGW from the onset of the big bang. The issue of the reality of gravitons as a measurable physical object which was raised by Rothman in 2006 is indirectly answered via a proceedure obtained from Weinberg's 1972 book on gravitation, and all the methodologies so obtained are referenced with respect to engineering specifications of the Li-Baker HFGW detector. In addition, the document also refers to entanglement entropy, and its possible aid in refining measurement predictions. Finally, commentary about HFGW and relic neutrino physics data sets is included, with regards to inflationary model candidates",Human
"Hard surfaces or magnetic surfaces can be used to propagate quasi-TEM modes inside closed waveguides. The interesting feature of these modes is an almost uniform field distribution inside the waveguide. But the mechanisms governing how these surfaces act, how they can be characterized, and further how the modes propagate are not detailed in the literature. In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We give some basic rules that govern the propagation of the quasi-TEM modes, and show that many of their characteristics (i.e. their dispersion curves) can be deduced from the simple analysis of the reflection properties of the involved surfaces.",Human
"Voltage-gated ion channels are key molecules for the generation and propagation of electrical signals in excitable cell membranes. The voltage-dependent switching of these channels between conducting and nonconducting states is a major factor in controlling the transmembrane voltage. In this study, a statistical mechanics model of these molecules has been discussed on the basis of a two-dimensional spin model. A new Hamiltonian and a new Monte Carlo simulation algorithm are introduced to simulate such a model. It was shown that the results well match the experimental data obtained from batrachotoxin-modified sodium channels in the squid giant axon using the cut-open axon technique.",Human
"This work presents the relations between the carbon to carbon bond lengths in the single, double and triple bonds and in graphite, butadiene and benzene. The Golden ratio, which was shown to divide the Bohr radius into two parts pertaining to the charged particles, the electron and proton, and to divide inter-atomic distances into their cationic and anionic radii, also plays a role in the carbon-carbon bonds and in the ionic/polar character of those in graphite, butadiene and benzene. Further, the bond energies of the various CC bonds are shown to vary linearly with the bond lengths.",Human
"We report an experimental study of liquid drops moving against gravity, when placed on a vertically vibrating inclined plate, which is partially wetted by the drop. The frequency of vibrations ranges from 30 to 200 Hz, and, above a threshold in vibration acceleration, drops experience an upward motion. We attribute this surprising motion to the deformations of the drop, as a consequence of an up or down symmetry breaking induced by the presence of the substrate. We relate the direction of motion to contact angle measurements. This phenomenon can be used to move a drop along an arbitrary path in a plane, without special surface treatments or localized forcing.",Human
"Any object on earth has two fundamental properties: it is finite, and it is made of atoms. Structural information about an object can be obtained from diffraction amplitude measurements that account for either one of these traits. Nyquist-sampling of the Fourier amplitudes is sufficient to image single particles of finite size at any resolution. Atomic resolution data is routinely used to image molecules replicated in a crystal structure. Here we report an algorithm that requires neither information, but uses the fact that an image of a natural object is compressible. Intended applications include tomographic diffractive imaging, crystallography, powder diffraction, small angle x-ray scattering and random Fourier amplitude measurements.",Human
We study the properties of a capacitive 13.56 MHz discharge properties with a mixture of Ar/C2H2 taking into account the plasmochemistry and growth of heavy hydrocarbons. A hybrid model was developed to combine the kinetic description for electron motion and the fluid approach for negative and positive ions transport and plasmochemical processes. A significant change of plasma parameters related to injection of 5.8% portion of acetylene in argon was observed and analyzed. We found that the electronegativity of the mixture is about 30%. The densities of negatively and positively charged heavy hydrocarbons are sufficiently large to be precursors for the formation of nanoparticles in the discharge volume.,Human
"A connection is established between discrete stochastic model describing microscopic motion of fluctuating cells, and macroscopic equations describing dynamics of cellular density. Cells move towards chemical gradient (process called chemotaxis) with their shapes randomly fluctuating. Nonlinear diffusion equation is derived from microscopic dynamics in dimensions one and two using excluded volume approach. Nonlinear diffusion coefficient depends on cellular volume fraction and it is demonstrated to prevent collapse of cellular density. A very good agreement is shown between Monte Carlo simulations of the microscopic Cellular Potts Model and numerical solutions of the macroscopic equations for relatively large cellular volume fractions. Combination of microscopic and macroscopic models were used to simulate growth of structures similar to early vascular networks.",Human
"In this work we present a general mechanism by which simple dynamics running on networks become self-organized critical for scale free topologies. We illustrate this mechanism with a simple arithmetic model of division between integers, the division model. This is the simplest self-organized critical model advanced so far, and in this sense it may help to elucidate the mechanism of self-organization to criticality. Its simplicity allows analytical tractability, characterizing several scaling relations. Furthermore, its mathematical nature brings about interesting connections between statistical physics and number theoretical concepts. We show how this model can be understood as a self-organized stochastic process embedded on a network, where the onset of criticality is induced by the topology.",Human
"The radial polynomials of the 2D (circular) and 3D (spherical) Zernike functions are tabulated as powers of the radial distance. The reciprocal tabulation of powers of the radial distance in series of radial polynomials is also given, based on projections that take advantage of the orthogonality of the polynomials over the unit interval. They may play a role in the expansion of products of the polynomials into sums, which is demonstrated by some examples. Multiplication of the polynomials by the angular bases (azimuth, polar angle) defines the Zernike functions, for which we derive and tabulate transformations to and from the Cartesian coordinate system centered at the middle of the circle or sphere.",Human
"During fast locomotion - gallop, half bound - of quadruped mammals, the ground contact of the limbs in each pair do not alternate symmetrically. Animals using such asymmetrical gait thus choose whether the left or the right limb will contact the ground first, and this gives rise to limb preference. Here, we report that dogs (Mammalia, Carnivora) and pikas (Mammalia, Lagomorpha) prefer one forelimb as trailing limb and use it as such almost twice as often as the other. We also show that this choice depends on the individual and is not a characteristic of the species, and that the strength of the preference was not dependent on the animal's running speed.",Human
"Hyperfine induced $1s2s ^1S_0 \to 1s^2 ^1S_0$ M1 transition probabilities of He-like ions have been calculated from relativistic configuration interaction wavefunctions including the frequency independent Breit interaction and QED effects. Present results for {$^{151}$}Eu and {$^{155}$}Gd are in good agreement with previous calculations [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 63}, 054105 (2001)]. Electronic data are given in terms of a general scaling law in $Z$ that, given isotopic nuclear spin and magnetic moment, allows hyperfine induced decay rates to be estimated for any isotope. The results should be helpful for future experimental investigations on QED and parity non-conservation effects.",Human
"The most costly and annoying characteristic of the e-mail communication system is the large number of unsolicited commercial e-mails, known as spams, that are continuously received. Via the investigation of the statistical properties of the spam delivering intertimes, we show that spams delivered to a given recipient are time correlated: if the intertime between two consecutive spams is small (large), then the next spam will most probably arrive after a small (large) intertime. Spam temporal correlations are reproduced by a numerical model based on the random superposition of spam sequences, each one described by the Omori law. This and other experimental findings suggest that statistical approaches may be used to infer how spammers operate.",Human
"Placing an ensemble of $10^6$ ultracold atoms in the near field of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator (CPWR) with $Q \sim 10^6$ one can achieve strong coupling between a single microwave photon in the CPWR and a collective hyperfine qubit state in the ensemble with $g_\textit{eff} / {2 \pi} \sim 40$ kHz larger than the cavity line width of ${\kappa}/{2 \pi} \sim 7$ kHz. Integrated on an atomchip such a system constitutes a hybrid quantum device, which also can be used to interconnect solid-state and atomic qubits, to study and control atomic motion via the microwave field, observe microwave super-radiance, build an integrated micro maser or even cool the resonator field via the atoms.",Human
"L-shape probability distributions are extremely non-Gaussian distributions that have been surprisingly successful in describing the frequency of occurrence of extreme events, ranging from stock market crashes and natural disasters, the structure of biological systems, fractals, and optical rogue waves. In this paper, we show that fluctuations in stimulated Raman scattering in silicon, as well as in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, can follow extreme value statistics and provide mathematical insight into the origin of this behavior. As an example of the experimental observations, we find that 16% of the Stokes pulses account for 84% of the pump energy transfer, an uncanny resemblance to the empirical Pareto principle or the 80/20 rule that describes important observation in socioeconomics.",Human
"We develop an analytical model of correlated two-electron ionization in strong infrared laser fields. The model includes all relevant interactions between the electrons, the laser field, and the ionic core nonperturbatively. We focus on the deeply quantum regime, where the energy of the active electron driven by the laser field is insufficient to collisionally ionize the parent ion, and the assistance of the laser field is required to create a doubly charged ion. In this regime, the electron-electron and the electron-ion interactions leave distinct footprints in the correlated two-electron spectra, recording the mutual dynamics of the escaping electrons.",Human
"We study the robustness of complex networks subject to edge removal. Several network models and removing strategies are simulated. Rather than the existence of the giant component, we use total connectedness as the criterion of breakdown. The network topologies are introduced a simple traffic dynamics and the total connectedness is interpreted not only in the sense of topology but also in the sense of function. We define the topological robustness and the functional robustness, investigate their combined effect and compare their relative importance to each other. The results of our study provide an alternative view of the overall robustness and highlight efficient ways to improve the robustness of the network models.",Human
"A scalar constitutive law is obtained for dense granular flows, both in the inertial regime where the grain inertia dominates, and in the viscous regime. Considering a pair of grains rather than a single grain, the classical arguments yield a constitutive law that exhibits a flow threshold expressed as a finite effective friction at flow onset. The value of the threshold is not predicted. The resulting law seems to be compatible with existing data, provided the saturation at high velocity (collisional regime) is added empirically. The law is not exactly the same in both regimes, which seems to indicate that there is no ""universal"" law.",Human
"The tragedy of the digital commons does not prevent the copious voluntary production of content that one witnesses in the web. We show through an analysis of a massive data set from \texttt{YouTube} that the productivity exhibited in crowdsourcing exhibits a strong positive dependence on attention, measured by the number of downloads. Conversely, a lack of attention leads to a decrease in the number of videos uploaded and the consequent drop in productivity, which in many cases asymptotes to no uploads whatsoever. Moreover, uploaders compare themselves to others when having low productivity and to themselves when exceeding a threshold.",Human
"We report a high energy-resolution neutron backscattering study, combined with in-situ diffraction, to investigate slow molecular motions on nanosecond time scales in the fluid phase of phospholipid bilayers of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phoshatidylcholine (DMPC) and DMPC/40% cholesterol (wt/wt). A cooperative structural relaxation process was observed. From the in-plane scattering vector dependence of the relaxation rates in hydrogenated and deuterated samples, combined with results from a 0.1 microsecond long all atom molecular dynamics simulation, it is concluded that correlated dynamics in lipid membranes occurs over several lipid distances, spanning a time interval from pico- to nanoseconds.",Human
"The nanoscale fluctuation dynamics of semi dilute high molecular weight polymer solutions of Polyethylenoxide (PEO) in D2O under non-equilibrium flow conditions were studied by the neutron spin-echo technique. The sample cell was in contraction flow geometry and provided a pressure driven flow with a high elongational component that stretched the polymers most efficiently. The experiments suggest that the mobility on the scale of a few monomers, comparable to the Kuhn segment length, becomes highly anisotropic and is enhanced perpendicular to the flow direction. Diffraction data show a weak structural correlation along the chains on a length scale of about 17 Angstroems, which might be related to the Kuhn length in this system.",Human
"We show that the chirality of artificial media, made of a planar periodic arrangement of three-dimensional metallic meta-atoms, can be tailored. The meta-atoms support localized plasmon polaritons and exhibit a chirality exceeding that of pseudo-planar chiral metamaterials by an order of magnitude. Two design approaches are investigated in detail. The first is the referential example for a chiral structure, namely a Moebius strip. The second example is a cut wire - split-ring resonator geometry that can be manufactured with state-of-the-art nanofabrication technologies. Driven into resonance these meta-atoms evoke a polarization rotation of $30^\circ$ per unit cell.",Human
"We use Bloch oscillations to transfer coherently many photon momenta to atoms. Then we can measure accurately the ratio h/m_Rb and deduce the fine structure constant alpha. The velocity variation due to the Bloch oscillations is measured thanks to Raman transitions. In a first experiment, two Raman $\pi$ pulses are used to select and measure a very narrow velocity class. This method yields to a value of the fine structure constant alpha^{-1}= 137.035 998 84 (91) with a relative uncertainty of about 6.6 ppb. More recently we use an atomic interferometer consisting in two pairs of pi/2 pulses. We present here the first results obtained with this method.",Human
Geostrophic jets propagating as Alfv\'en waves are shown to arise ina rapidly rotating spherical shell permeated by a magnetic field among the transient motions set up by an impulsive rotation of the inner core. These axially invariant motions evolve on a time-scale which is short compared to the magnetic diffusion time. The numerical study is taken as illustrative of a more general point: on such a fast time-scale the dimensionless number appropriate to compare the rotation and magnetic forces is independent of the magnetic diffusivity in contrast with the often used Elsasser number. Extension of the analysis to non-axisymmetrical motions is supported by published studies of dynamo models and magnetic instabilities.,Human

"We consider a damped $\beta$-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain, driven at one boundary subjected to stochastic noise. It is shown that, for a fixed driving amplitude and frequency, increasing the noise intensity, the system's energy resonantly responds to the modulating frequency of the forcing signal. Multiple peaks appear in the signal to noise ratio, signalling the phenomenon of stochastic resonance. The presence of multiple peaks is explained by the existence of many stable and metastable states that are found when solving this boundary value problem for a semi-continuum approximation of the model. Stochastic resonance is shown to be generated by transitions between these states.",Human
"We theoretically investigate the properties of crossing for two perpendicular subwavelength plasmonic slot waveguides. We show that, when encountering nano intersection, the crosstalk for the direct crossing is around 25%, almost same as throughout. In terms of symmetry considerations and resonant-tunnelling effect, we design compact cavity-based structures. Our results show that the crosstalk is eliminated and the throughput reaches the unity on resonance. Simulations results are in agreement with those from the coupled-model theory. When taking into account of the material loss, due to the unchanged symmetry properties of the modes, the crosstalk is still suppressed. Our results may open a way to construct nanoscale crossings for high-density nanoplasmonic integration circuits.",Human
"In this work we present a dynamical model that succesfully describes the organization of mutualistic ecological systems. The main characteristic of these systems is the nested structure of the bipartite adjacency matrix describing their interactions. We introduce a nestedness coefficient, as an alternative to the Atmar and Patterson temperature, commonly used to measure the nestedness degree of the network. This coefficient has the advantage of being based on the robustness of the ecological system and it is not only describing the ordering of the bipartite matrix but it is also able to tell the difference, if any, between the degree of organization of each guild.",Human
"We report on a novel optofluidic system consisting of a silica-based 1D photonic crystal, integrated planar waveguides and electrically insulated fluidic channels. An array of pillars in a microfluidic channel designed for electrochromatography is used as a resonator for on-column label-free refractive index detection. The resonator was fabricated in a silicon oxynitride platform, to support electroosmotic flow, and operated at 1.55 microns. Different aqueous solutions of ethanol with refractive indices ranging from n = 1.3330 to 1.3616 were pumped into the column/resonator and the transmission spectra were recorded. Linear shifts of the resonant wavelengths yielded a maximum sensitivity of 480 nm/RIU and a minimum difference of 0.007 RIU was measured.",Human
"Physical time intervals are attributes of single physical object whereas physical space intervals are a relational attribute of two physical objects. Some consequences of the breaking of the space-time exchange symmetry inherent in the Lorentz transformation following from the above distinction are investigated. In particular, it is shown that the relativity of simultaneity and length contraction effects which naively follow from space-time symmetry of the Lorentz transformation do not occur. Seven laws describing the relation between observations of space intervals, time intervals and velocities in different reference frames are given. Only two of these laws are respected by conventional special relativity theory.",Human
"One of the key socioeconomic phenomena to explain is the distribution of wealth. Bouchaud and M\'ezard have proposed an interesting model of economy [Bouchaud and M\'ezard (2000)] based on trade and investments of agents. In the mean-field approximation, the model produces a stationary wealth distribution with a power-law tail. In this paper we examine characteristic time scales of the model and show that for any finite number of agents, the validity of the mean-field result is time-limited and the model in fact has no stationary wealth distribution. Further analysis suggests that for heterogeneous agents, the limitations are even stronger. We conclude with general implications of the presented results.",Human
"We extend the Saffman theory of membrane hydrodynamics to account for the correlated motion of membrane proteins, along with the effect of protein concentration on that correlation and on the response of the membrane to stresses. Expressions for the coupling diffusion coefficients of protein pairs and their concentration dependence are derived in the limit of small protein size relative to the inter-protein separation. The additional role of membrane viscosity as determining the characteristic length scale for membrane response leads to unusual concentration effects at large separation -- the transverse coupling increases with protein concentration, whereas the longitudinal one becomes concentration-independent.",Human
"We calculated the Fresnel paraxial propagator in a birefringent plate having topological charge $q$ at its center, named ""$q$-plate"". We studied the change of the beam transverse profile when it traverses the plate. An analytical closed form of the beam profile propagating in the ""$q$-plate"" can be found for many important specific input beam profiles. We paid particular attention to the plate having a topological unit charge and we found that if small losses due to reflection, absorption and scattering are neglected, the plate can convert the photon spin into orbital angular momentum with up to 100% efficiency, provided the thickness of the plate is less than the Rayleigh range of the incident beam.",Human
"A ray-rotation sheet consists of miniaturized optical components that function - ray optically - as a homogeneous medium that rotates the local direction of transmitted light rays around the sheet normal by an arbitrary angle [A. C. Hamilton et al., arXiv:0809.2646 (2008)]. Here we show that two or more parallel ray-rotation sheets perform imaging between two planes. The image is unscaled and un-rotated. No other planes are imaged. When seen through parallel ray-rotation sheets, planes that are not imaged appear rotated, whereby the rotation angle changes with the ratio between the observer's and the object plane's distance from the sheets.",Human
"Volumes of sub-wavelength electromagnetic elements can act like homogeneous materials: metamaterials. In analogy, sheets of optical elements such as prisms can act ray-optically like homogeneous sheet materials. In this sense, such sheets can be considered to be metamaterials for light rays (METATOYs). METATOYs realize new and unusual transformations of the directions of transmitted light rays. We study here, in the ray-optics and scalar-wave limits, the wave-optical analog of such transformations, and we show that such an analog does not always exist. Perhaps, this is the reason why many of the ray-optical possibilities offered by METATOYs have never before been considered.",Human
"Real-data networks often appear to have strong modularity, or network-of-networks structure, in which subgraphs of various size and consistency occur. Finding the respective subgraph structure is of great importance, in particular for understanding the dynamics on these networks. Here we study modular networks using generalized method of maximum likelihood. We first demonstrate how the method works on computer-generated networks with the subgraphs of controlled connection strengths and clustering. We then implement the algorithm which is based on weights of links and show its efficiency in finding weighted subgraphs on fully connected graph and on real-data network of yeast.",Human
"A magnetometer using spin-polarized K and $^3$He atoms occupying the same volume is used to search for anomalous nuclear spin-dependent forces generated by a separate $^3$He spin source. We measure changes in the $^3$He spin precession frequency with a resolution of 18 pHz and constrain anomalous spin forces between neutrons to be less than $2 \times 10^{-8}$ of their magnetic or less than $2\times 10^{-3}$ of their gravitational interactions on a length scale of 50 cm. We present new limits on neutron coupling to light pseudoscalar and vector particles, including torsion, and constraints on recently proposed models involving unparticles and spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry.",Human
"In this paper we derive an updating scheme for calculating some important network statistics such as degree, clustering coefficient, etc., aiming at reduce the amount of computation needed to track the evolving behavior of large networks; and more importantly, to provide efficient methods for potential use of modeling the evolution of networks. Using the updating scheme, the network statistics can be computed and updated easily and much faster than re-calculating each time for large evolving networks. The update formula can also be used to determine which edge/node will lead to the extremal change of network statistics, providing a way of predicting or designing evolution rule of networks.",Human
Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock electric quadrupole (E2) and magnetic dipole (M1) transition probabilities are reported for transitions between levels of 3d^5 in [Fe IV]. The accuracy of the ab initio energy levels and the agreement in the length and velocity forms of the line strength for the E2 transitions are used as indicators of accuracy. The present E2 and M1 transition probabilities are compared with earlier Breit-Pauli results and other theories. An extensive set of transition probabilites with indicators of accuracy are reported in Appendices A and B. Recommended values of A(E2) + A(M1) are listed in Appendix C.,Human
"Muon ionization cooling is the only practical method for preparing high-brilliance beams needed for a neutrino factory or muon collider. The muon ionization cooling experiment (MICE) under development at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory comprises a dedicated beamline to generate a range of input emittance and momentum, with time-of-flight and Cherenkov detectors to ensure a pure muon beam. A first measurement of emittance is performed in the upstream magnetic spectrometer with a scintillating-fiber tracker. A cooling cell will then follow, alternating energy loss in liquid hydrogen with RF acceleration. A second spectrometer identical to the first and a particle identification system will measure the outgoing emittance. Plans for measurements of emittance and cooling are described.",Human
"Using a non-selective broadband detection scheme we discovered an efficient mechanism of formation of ultracold Cs$_2$ molecules in deeply bound levels ($v=1-9$) of their electronic ground state X$^1 \Sigma_g^+$. They are formed by a one-photon photoassociation of ultracold cesium atoms in a manifold of excited electronic states, followed by a two-step spontaneous emission cascade. We were able to form about $10^5-10^6$ molecules per second in these low vibrational levels of the ground state. This detection scheme could be generalized to other molecular species for the systematic investigation of cold molecule formation mechanisms.",Human
"In this Letter, we present a study of the confinement properties of point-defect resonators in finite-size photonic-bandgap structures composed of aperiodic arrangements of dielectric rods, with special emphasis on their use for the design of cavities for particle accelerators. Specifically, for representative geometries, we study the properties of the fundamental mode (as a function of the filling fraction, structure size, and losses) via 2-D and 3-D full-wave numerical simulations, as well as microwave measurements at room temperature. Results indicate that, for reduced-size structures, aperiodic geometries exhibit superior confinement properties by comparison with periodic ones.",Human
"We study the dynamics of the adoption of new products by agents with continuous opinions and discrete actions (CODA). The model is such that the refusal in adopting a new idea or product is increasingly weighted by neighbor agents as evidence against the product. Under these rules, we study the distribution of adoption times and the final proportion of adopters in the population. We compare the cases where initial adopters are clustered to the case where they are randomly scattered around the social network and investigate small world effects on the final proportion of adopters. The model predicts a fat tailed distribution for late adopters which is verified by empirical data.",Human
"We propose an efficient method for spatial filtering of light beams by propagating them through 2D (also 3D) longitudinally chirped photonic crystals, i.e. through the photonic structures with fixed transverse lattice period and with the longitudinal lattice period varying along the direction of the beam propagation. We prove the proposed idea by numerically solving the paraxial propagation equation in refraction index-modulated media, and we evaluate the efficiency of the process by plane-wave-expansion analysis. The technique can be applied to filter (to clean) the packages of atomic waves (Bose condensates), as well improve the directionality of acoustic and mechanical waves.",Human
"We have employed the relativistic coupled-cluster theory to calculate the electric dipole matrix elements in the singly ionized barium (Ba$^+$) and radium (Ra$^+$). Matrix elements of Ba$^+$ are used to determine the light-shift ratios for two different wavelengths on which recent experiments are carried out. By combining the measured light-shift ratios and our calculations, we are able to estimate possible errors associate with the used matrix elements in Ba$^+$. Static polarizabilities of the low-lying states and lifetimes of the first excited P-states are also determined using these matrix elements in Ba$^+$. A similar approach has been followed to estimate the lifetimes and light-shift ratios in Ra$^+$.",Human
"We present a technique capable of producing subwavelength focal spots in the far-field of the source in planar non-resonant structures. The approach combines the diffraction gratings that generate the high-wavevector-number modes and planar slabs of homogeneous anisotropic metamaterials that propagate these waves and combine them at the subwavelength focal spots. In a sense, the technique combines the benefits of Fresnel lens, near-field zone plates, hyperlens, and superlens, and at the same time resolves their fundamental limitations. Several realizations of the proposed technique for visible, near-IR, and mid-IR frequencies are proposed, and their performance is analyzed theoretically and numerically. Generalization of the developed approach for sub-diffractional on-chip photonics is suggested.",Human
"The paper discusses impact of the velocity curl on some conservation laws in the gravitational field and electromagnetic field, by means of the characteristics of quaternions. When the velocity curl can not be neglected, it will cause the predictions to departure slightly from the conservation laws, which include mass continuity equation, charge continuity equation, and conservation of spin, etc. And the scalar potential of gravitational field has an effect on the speed of light, the conservation of mass, and conservation of charge, etc. The results explain how the velocity curl influences some conservation laws in the gravitational field and electromagnetic field.",Human
We propose an improved photoassociation scheme to produce ultracold molecules in their vibronic ground state for the generic case where non-adiabatic effects facilitating transfer to deeply bound levels are absent. Formation of molecules is achieved by short laser pulses in a Raman-like pump-dump process where an additional near-infrared laser field couples the excited state to an auxiliary state. The coupling due to the additional field effectively changes the shape of the excited state potential and allows for efficient population transfer to low-lying vibrational levels of the electronic ground state. Repetition of many pump-dump sequences together with collisional relaxation allows for accumulation of molecules in v=0.,Human
"A summary of the relationship between the Langevin equation, Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov forward equation (FPKfe) and the Feynman path integral descriptions of stochastic processes relevant for the solution of the continuous-discrete filtering problem is provided in this paper. The practical utility of the path integral formula is demonstrated via some nontrivial examples. Specifically, it is shown that the simplest approximation of the path integral formula for the fundamental solution of the FPKfe can be applied to solve nonlinear continuous-discrete filtering problems quite accurately. The Dirac-Feynman path integral filtering algorithm is quite simple, and is suitable for real-time implementation.",Human
"The interaction between a light pulse, traveling in air, and a generic linear, non-absorbing and dispersive structure is analyzed. It is shown that energy conservation imposes a constraint between the group velocities of the transmitted and reflected light pulses. It follows that the two fields propagate with group velocities depending on the dispersive properties of the environment (air) and on the transmission properties of the optical structure, and are one faster and the other slower than the incident field. In other words, the group velocity of a light pulse in a dispersive medium is reminiscent of previous interactions. One example is discussed in detail.",Human
"Rates of depopulation by blackbody radiation (BBR) and effective lifetimes of alkali-metal \textit{nS}, \textit{n}P and \textit{nD} Rydberg states have been calculated in a wide range of principal quantum numbers $n \le 80$ at the ambient temperatures of 77, 300 and 600 K. Quasiclassical formulas were used to calculate the radial matrix elements of the dipole transitions from Rydberg states. Good agreement of our numerical results with the available theoretical and experimental data has been found. We have also obtained simple analytical formulas for estimates of effective lifetimes and BBR-induced depopulation rates, which well agree with the numerical data.",Human
"The analytical treatment of nonlinear evolution of the shear-flow-modified current driven ion cyclotron instability and shear-flow-driven ion cyclotron kinetic instabilities of magnetic field--aligned plasma shear flow is presented. Analysis is performed on the base of the nonlinear dispersion equation, which accounts for a new combined effect of plasma turbulence and shear flow. It consists in turbulent scattering of ions across the shear flow with their convection by shear flow and results in enhanced nonlinear broadening of ion cyclotron resonances. This effect is found to lead to the saturation of ion cyclotron instabilities as well as to the development of nonlinear shear flow driven ion cyclotron instability. 52.35.Ra",Human
We study a spatial Prisoner's dilemma game with two types (A and B) of players located on a square lattice. Players following either cooperator or defector strategies play Prisoner's Dilemma games with their 24 nearest neighbors. The players are allowed to adopt one of their neighbor's strategy with a probability dependent on the payoff difference and type of the given neighbor. Players A and B have different efficiency in the transfer of their own strategy therefore the strategy adoption probability is reduced by a multiplicative factor (w < 1) from the players of type B. We report that the motion of the influential payers (type A) can improve remarkably the maintenance of cooperation even for their low densities.,Human
"The use of gas expansions to generate atomic or molecular beams has become a standard technique in nuclear and hadron physics for the production of polarized ion beams and gas targets. A direct simulation Monte Carlo method was used to understand the processes occurring in an expansion of highly dissociated hydrogen or deuterium gas at low densities. The results were verified in several measurements including time-of-flight and beam-profile determinations which showed that the supersonic gas expansions can properly be described by the Monte Carlo calculations. Additionally a new method of beam formation, the hollow carrier jet, was tested under the conditions of the atomic beam source operation.",Human
"The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will carry out a systematic investigation of ionization cooling of a muon beam. As the emittance measurement will be done on a particle-by-particle basis, sophisticated beam instrumentation is needed to measure particle coordinates and timing vs RF. A PID system based on three time-of-flight stations, two Aerogel Cerenkov detectors and a KLOE-like calorimeter has been constructed in order to keep beam contamination ($e, \pi$) well below 1%. The MICE time-of-flight system will measure timing with a resolution better than 70 ps per plane, in a harsh environment due to high particle rates, fringe magnetic fields and electron backgrounds from RF dark current.",Human
"The aim of the presented work was to develop further techniques based on a Micromegas-TPC, in order to reach a high gas gain with good energy resolution, and to search for gas mixtures suitable for rare event detection. This paper focuses on xenon, which is convenient for the search of neutrinoless double beta decay in 136 Xe. Conversely, a small admixture of xenon to CF 4 can reduce attachment in the latter. This gas mixture would be suitable for dark matter searches and the study of solar and reactor neutrinos. Various configurations of the Micromegas plane were investigated and are described.",Human
We propose a new formulation of the probability distribution function of wind driven water surface slope with an $\alpha$-stable distribution probability. The mathematical formulation of the probability distribution function is given under an integral formulation. Application to represent the probability of time slope data from laboratory experiments is carried out with satisfactory results. We compare also the $\alpha$-stable model of the water surface slopes with the Gram-Charlier development and the non-Gaussian model of Liu et al\cite{Liu}. Discussions and conclusions are conducted on the basis of the data fit results and the model analysis comparison.,Human
"In this paper considering quantum heat transport equation (QHT) formulated in our earlier papers the temperature for universes with G < 0 is calculated. As the solution of complex QHT (Schrodinger type equation), the temperature is complex also.

The agreement with observational data for our Universe is quite good. PACS 98.62.Py PACS 98.80.Bp PACS 98.80.Cq",Human
"The optical birefringence of rod-like nematogens (7CB, 8CB), imbibed in parallel silica channels with 10 nm diameter and 300 micrometer length, is measured and compared to the thermotropic bulk behavior. The orientational order of the confined liquid crystals, quantified by the uniaxial nematic ordering parameter, evolves continuously between paranematic and nematic states, in contrast to the discontinuous isotropic-to-nematic bulk phase transitions. A Landau-de Gennes model reveals that the strength of the orientational ordering fields, imposed by the silica walls, is beyond a critical threshold, that separates discontinuous from continuous paranematic-to-nematic behavior. Quenched disorder effects, attributable to wall irregularities, leave the transition temperatures affected only marginally, despite the strong ordering fields in the channels.",Human
"The distribution of votes of one of the corporate parties in Mexico during elections of 2000, 2003 and 2006 is analyzed. After proper normalization and unfolding the agreement of the votes distributions with those of daisy models of several ranks is good. These models are generated by retaining each $r+1$ level in a sequence which follows a Poisson distribution.Beyond the fact that rank 2 daisy model resembles the distribution of the quasi-optimal distances for the Traveling Salesman Problem no clear explanation exists for this behavior, but the agreement is not fortuitous and the possibility of a universal phenomena for corporate vote is discussed.",Human
"In this paper we report a spectrometric approach to dual-energy digital radiography that has been developed and applied to identify specific organic substances and discern small differences in their effective atomic number. An experimental setup has been designed, and a theoretical description proposed based on the experimental results obtained.

"The muon spectrometer of the ATLAS experiment is one of the largest detectors ever built. At the LHC, new physics signs could appear through high momentun muons (1 TeV). Identification and precise momentum measurement of such muons are two of the main challenges of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. In order to get a good resolution for high energy muons (i.e. 10% at 1 TeV), the accuracy on the alignment of precision chambers must be of the order of 50 microns. Several procedures have been developed to reach such a precision. This document describes complementary techniques used to align the muon sub-detectors, and their results : the optical system, the muon cosmic rays and the straight tracks coming from collisions.",Human
"The nonlinear interaction of waves in a driven medium may lead to wave turbulence, a state such that energy is transferred from large to small lengthscales. Here, wave turbulence is observed in experiments on a vibrating plate. The frequency power spectra of the normal velocity of the plate may be rescaled on a single curve, with power-law behaviors that are incompatible with the weak turbulence theory of D{\""u}ring et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 025503 (2006)]. Alternative scenarios are suggested to account for this discrepancy -- in particular the occurrence of wave breaking at high frequencies. Finally, the statistics of velocity increments do not display an intermittent behavior.",Human
"The underlying mechanism of the stationary light pulse (SLP) was identified as a band gap being created by a Bragg grating formed by two counter-propagating coupling fields of similar wavelength. Here we present a more general view of the formation of SLPs, namely several balanced four-wave mixing processes sharing the same ground-state coherence. Utilizing this new concept we report the first experimental observation of a bichromatic SLP at wavelengths for which no Bragg grating can be established. We also demonstrate the production of a SLP directly from a propagating light pulse without prior storage. Being easily controlled externally makes SLPs a very versatile tool for low-light-level nonlinear optics and quantum information manipulation.",Human
"In this work we present a simple and fast computational method, the visibility algorithm, that converts a time series into a graph. The constructed graph inherits several properties of the series in its structure. Thereby, periodic series convert into regular graphs, and random series do so into random graphs. Moreover, fractal series convert into scale-free networks, enhancing the fact that power law degree distributions are related to fractality, something highly discussed recently. Some remarkable examples and analytical tools are outlined in order to test the method's reliability. Many different measures, recently developed in the complex network theory, could by means of this new approach characterize time series from a new point of view.",Human
"In the CF-LERN field (Cold Fusion and Low Energy Nuclear reactions) many experimental results are available: unexplained energy production, presence of unusual patterns of classical fusion reaction products, isotopic composition variations, sporadic emission of nuclear radiations. These effects are not always observed, for similar experimental conditions. Should a fundamental reason exist for these effects to occur, funding would be justified, to make them repeatable and more intense (this step being likely to be a trial and error process, might require a substantial amount of money). In this article, a possible fundamental explanation of the phenomenon is described, together with the experimental plan to assess it.",Human
"Accurate description of the topography of active faults surfaces represents an important geophysical issue because this topography is strongly related to the stress distribution along fault planes, and therefore to processes implicated in earthquake nucleation, propagation, and arrest. With the recent development of Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) apparatus, it is now possible to measure accurately the 3D topography of rough surfaces with a comparable resolution in all directions, both at field and laboratory scales. In the present study, we have investigated the scaling properties including possible anisotropy properties of several outcrops of two natural fault surfaces (Vuache strike-slip fault, France, and Magnola normal fault, Italy) in limestones.",Human

"It is well known that Raman scattering and fluorescence can be enhanced by the presence of metallic nanoparticles. Here, we derive simple equations to analyse the influence of metallic nanoparticles on upconversion processes such as non-radiative energy transfer or excited state absorption. We compare the resulting expressions with the more familiar Raman and fluorescence cases, and find significant differences. We use numerical simulations to calculate the upconverted signal enhancement achievable by means of metallic spheres of different radii, and find particles of 100-400nm radius at infrared frequencies to be favorable. We also discuss the considerable challenges involved in using metallic particles to enhance upconversion for solar energy.",Human
"Main aim of this topical issue is to report recent advances in noisy nonequilibrium processes useful to describe the dynamics of ecological systems and to address the mechanisms of spatio-temporal pattern formation in ecology both from the experimental and theoretical points of view. This is in order to understand the dynamical behaviour of ecological complex systems through the interplay between nonlinearity, noise, random and periodic environmental interactions. Discovering the microscopic rules and the local interactions which lead to the emergence of specific global patterns or global dynamical behaviour and the noises role in the nonlinear dynamics is an important, key aspect to understand and then to model ecological complex systems.",Human

All these schemes are either symplectic maps or integrable (preserving the energy integral) maps, or both. We describe and explain systematic errors (produced by any method) in numerical computations of the period and the amplitude of oscillations. We propose a new numerical scheme which is a modification of the discrete gradient method. This discretization preserves (almost exactly) the period of small oscillations for any time step.",Human
"Studies are cited indicating that gravitino production acts as a natural upper bound to Li6 and Li7 levels, based on what happens after hadronic decay of relic 1 TeV into 100 GeV gravitinos at 1000 s. after the Big Bang. The produced gravitinos contribute a large fraction of required dark matter density. Whether or not gravitinos can be linked to neutrino production depends on which model of dark matter (DM) is assumed or used. A model presented by the author in 2008 links DM of about 100 GeV -- based on a phenomenological Lagrangian creating different Neutrino masses without SUSY -- with a dark matter candidate of about 100 GeV. This may tie in 100 GeV gravitinos with neutrino physics.",Human
"Focusing electromagnetic energy to sub-wavelength dimensions has become an increasingly active field of research for a variety of applications such as Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR), nanolithography, and nanoscale optical characterization of biological cells and single molecules using near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) technique. Double-sided surface plasmons in a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) geometry have been shown to have very small wavelengths for dielectric of thickness of less than 10 nm.

"We study a simple reaction-diffusion population model [proposed by A. Windus and H. J. Jensen, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40, 2287 (2007)] on scale-free networks. In the case of fully random diffusion, the network topology cannot affect the critical death rate, whereas the heterogeneous connectivity can cause smaller steady population density and critical population density. In the case of modified diffusion, we obtain a larger critical death rate and steady population density, at the meanwhile, lower critical population density, which is good for the survival of species. The results were obtained using a mean-field-like framework and were confirmed by computer simulations.",Human

This herd is observed in the sky as a group of stars, the Pleiades, close to Aldebaran, the main star in the Taurus constellation.

For this model we compare the PF of the stock price returns, the PF of the volatility and the return correlation with the same statistical characteristics obtained from real market data.",Human

A Doppler effect broadening of the X-ray line was established which could be attributed to different Coulomb de-excitation steps preceding the measured transition. The assumption of a statistical population of the hyperfine levels of the muonic hydrogen ground state was directly confirmed by the experiment and measured values for the hyperfine splitting can be reported. The results allow a decisive test of advanced cascade model calculations and establish a method to extract fundamental strong-interaction parameters from pionic hydrogen experiments.,Human
"The problem of the molecular diffusion in a biphasic fluid mixture is studied here from the two complementary points of view of Continuum Mechanics - in a somewhat different manner from Truesdell in ""Mechanical basis of diffusion"" (J. Chem. Physics (U.S.), 37 (1962) 2336-2344) - and that of Thermodynamics. It is established that the force involved in the 'diffusive drag', i.e. in the inter-constituent viscous friction, is necessarily linked to the relative diffusion velocity of one constituent with respect to the other. We also end up with Fick's first law, which appears to be a sufficient condition for the dissipated power associated with the diffusive motions to be positive.",Human
"Wave-packet interference is investigated within the complex quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formalism using a hydrodynamic description. Quantum interference leads to the formation of the topological structure of quantum caves in space-time Argand plots. These caves consist of the vortical and stagnation tubes originating from the isosurfaces of the amplitude of the wave function and its first derivative. Complex quantum trajectories display counterclockwise helical wrapping around the stagnation tubes and hyperbolic deflection near the vortical tubes. The string of alternating stagnation and vortical tubes is sufficient to generate divergent trajectories. Moreover, the average wrapping time for trajectories and the rotational rate of the nodal line in the complex plane can be used to define the lifetime for interference features.",Human
"This short article describes flow parameters, numerical method, and animations of the fluid dynamics video LES of an Inclined Jet into a Supersonic Cross-Flow (http://hdl.handle.net/1813/11480). Helium is injected through an inclined round jet into a supersonic air flow at Mach 3.6. The video shows 2D contours of Mach number and magnitude of density gradient, and 3D iso-surfaces of Helium mass-fraction and vortical structures. Large eddy simulation with the sub-grid scale (LES-SGS) stretched vortex model of turbulent and scalar transport captures the main flow features: bow shock, Mach disk, shear layers, counter-rotating vortices, and large-scale structures.",Human
"The ""weighted ensemble"" method, introduced by Huber and Kim, [G. A. Huber and S. Kim, Biophys. J. 70, 97 (1996)], is one of a handful of rigorous approaches to path sampling of rare events. Expanding earlier discussions, we show that the technique is statistically exact for a wide class of Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. The derivation is based on standard path-integral (path probability) ideas, but recasts the weighted-ensemble approach as simple ""resampling"" in path space. Similar reasoning indicates that arbitrary nonstatic binning procedures, which merely guide the resampling process, are also valid. Numerical examples confirm the claims, including the use of bins which can adaptively find the target state in a simple model.",Human
"We study the asymptotic expansion of the neutral-atom energy as the atomic number Z goes to infinity, presenting a new method to extract the coefficients from oscillating numerical data. We find that recovery of the correct expansion is an exact condition on the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy that is important for the accuracy of approximate kinetic energy functionals for atoms, molecules and solids, when evaluated on a Kohn-Sham density. For example, this determines the small gradient limit of any generalized gradient approximation, and conflicts somewhat with the standard gradient expansion. Tests are performed on atoms, molecules, and jellium clusters. We also give a modern, highly accurate parametrization of the Thomas-Fermi density of neutral atoms.",Human
"Shapes of planar lipid monolayer domains at the air-water interface are theoretically and numerically investigated by minimizing the formation energy of the domains which consist of the surface energy, line tension energy, and dipole electrostatic energy. The shape equation which describes boundary curves of the domains at equilibrium state is derived from the first order variation of the formation energy. A relaxation method is proposed to find the numerical solutions of the shape equation. The theoretical and numerical results are in good agreement with previous experimental observation. Some new shapes not observed in previous experiments are also obtained, which awaits experimental confirmation in the future.",Human
"We demonstrate how to construct and operate a simple and affordable experimental apparatus, appropriate for an undergraduate setting, in order to produce and study coherent effects in atomic vapor and to investigate their applications for metrology. The apparatus consists of a vertical cavity surface emitting diode laser (VCSEL) directly current-modulated using a tunable microwave oscillator to produce multiple optical fields needed for the observation of the coherent population trapping (CPT). This effect allows very accurate measurement of the transition frequency between two ground state hyperfine sublevels (a ""clock transition""), that can be used to construct a CPT-based atomic clock.",Human
The low-frequency instability of a magnetized plasma column and the anomalous radial plasma convection are shown to be linked with the existence of a radial cross-field current along a plasma channel rotating around the central magnetized plasma. The direct observation of the rotating plasma is obtained using an ultra-fast intensified camera. The ionizing electrons injected along the axis of the plasma column contribute to the accumulation of negative charges when the axial collector is at floating potential. The required neutrality leads to the continuous radial expulsion of energetic electrons and to the formation of a rotating plasma channel (m=1 unstable wave). This situation has previously been interpreted erroneously as a diamagnetic drift wave.,Human
"This chapter presents, from a quantum-mechanical point of view, a tutorial discussion of elementary collision processes in the bulk of a gas discharge. Instead of merely listing kitchen-made cross section formulae and unrelated cross section data, emphasis has been given on an unified description of elementary processes based on general principles of quantum-mechanical multi-channel scattering theory. By necessity, the presentation is rather dense. Technical details left out, as well as cross section data, can be found, respectively, in the quoted original papers and the review articles, monographs, and web-sites mentioned in the introductory remarks to this chapter.",Human
"For several flows of laboratory turbulence, we obtain long records of velocity data. These records are divided into numerous segments. In each segment, we calculate the mean rate of energy dissipation, the mean energy at each scale, and the mean total energy. Their values fluctuate significantly among the segments. The fluctuations are lognormal, if the segment length lies within the range of large scales where the velocity correlations are weak but not yet absent. Since the lognormality is observed regardless of the Reynolds number and the configuration for turbulence production, it is expected to be universal. The likely origin is some multiplicative stochastic process related to interactions among scales through the energy transfer.",Human
"The Osher-Chakrabarthy family of linear flux-modification schemes is considered. Improved lower bounds on the compression factors are provided, which suggest the viability of using the unlimited version. The LLF flux formula is combined with these schemes in order to obtain efficient finite-difference algorithms. The resulting schemes are applied to a battery of numerical tests, going from advection and Burgers equations to Euler and MHD equations, including the double Mach reflection and the Orszag-Tang 2D vortex problem. Total-variation-bounded behavior is evident in all cases, even with time-independent upper bounds. The proposed schemes, however, do not deal properly with compound shocks, arising from non-convex fluxes, as shown by Buckley-Leverett test simulations.",Human
"We need enough new carbon sinks to 1) cancel out any continuing use of fossil fuels, 2) overcome the delayed effect of earlier excesses, and then 3) lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations to the old maximum value of 280 ppm. We need to sink about 25 billion tonnes of carbon each year, half to counter current emissions and commitments, and half for drawing down the CO2 concentrations within a few decades. A very large carbon sink could be created by sinking sewage in offshore dead zones. Half of all people live close enough to a coast to personally contribute, making the sink size close to half the annual food production.",Human
This study is a first synthesis focused on incised-valleys located within the inner shelf of the Bay of Biscay. It is based on previously published results obtained during recent seismic surveys and coring campaigns. The morphology of the valleys appears to be strongly controlled by tectonics and lithology. The Pleistocene sedimentary cover of the shelf is very thin and discontinuous with a maximum thickness ranging between 30 and 40 m in incised-valley fills. Thus the incised bedrock morphology plays a key-role by controlling hydrodynamics and related sediment transport and deposition that explains some variations of those incised-valley fills with respect to the previously published general models.,Human
"A new analysis of the Lunar Prospector epithermal neutron data is presented, providing an improved map of the distribution of hydrogen near to the lunar poles. This is achieved using a specially developed pixon image reconstruction algorithm to deconvolve the instrumental response of the Lunar Prospector's neutron spectrometer from the observed data, while simultaneously suppressing the statistical noise. The results show that these data alone require the hydrogen to be concentrated into the cold traps at up to 1 wt% water-equivalent hydrogen. This combination of localisation and high concentration suggests that the hydrogen is present either in the form of a volatile compound or as solar wind protons implanted into small regolith grains.",Human
"We discuss the application of stress-induced changes in the crystal of a monolithic Nd:YAG laser as a possibility for microforce measurement. In fact, application of an unknown force on the resonator-amplifier-crystal can lead to a several gigahertz change, depending on the force intensity, of the laser frequency. In addition, the changes rates of the two orthogonally polarizations of the same mode with applied force are different. Hence, the strength of the applied stress can be deduced from measurement of induced change in the beat frequency between the two polarizations or between the fast mode (mode polarized in the orthogonal direction of the stress) and a reference frequency.",Human
"The globalised cascaded scattering matrix technique is a well proven, practical method that can be used to simulate large accelerating RF structures in which realistic fabrication errors to be incorporated in an efficient manner without the necessity to re-mesh the entire geometry. The globalised scattering matrix (GMS) technique allows one to obtain the scattering matrix for a structure. The method allows rapid e.m. field calculations to be obtained. Results are presented on monopole mode fields and dispersion relations calculated from direct and analytical methods. Analytical approximate results are also presented for the equivalent shunt susceptance of an iris loaded structure.",Human
"A plane lights on monochromatically and immediately after lights off, while an observer starts moving out from the plane, perpendicularly to it, with constant proper acceleration.

"We introduce the Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) model in a social networks to describe the three-state dynamics of opinion formation. It shows that the probability distribution function of the time series of opinion is a Gaussian-like distribution. We also study the response of BEG model to the external periodic perturbation. One can observe that both the interior thermo-noise and the external field result in phase transition, which is a split phenomena of the opinion distributions. It is opposite between the effect acted on the opinion systems of the amplitude of the external field and of the thermo-noise.",Human
"The compact linear collider (CLIC) requires a crab cavity to align bunches prior to collision. The bunch structure demands tight amplitude and phase tolerances of the RF fields inside the cavity, for the minimal luminosity loss. Beam loading effects require special attention as it is one potential sources of field errors in the cavity. In order to assist the amplitude and phase control, we propose a travelling wave (TW) structure with a high group velocity allowing rapid propagation of errors out of the system. Such a design makes the cavity structure significantly different from previous ones. This paper will look at the implications of this on other cavity parameters and the optimisation of the cavity geometry.",Human
"In this work our previous fully differential ionization cross section calculations using the semiclassical, impact parameter method are improved by a new method suitable to calculate impact parameter values corresponding to different momentum transfers. This goal is achieved by two successive steps. First, using the transverse momentum balance different projectile scattering angles are calculated for the binary and recoil peak regions as a function of the transferred momentum. Then, by treating the projectile scattering as a classical potential scattering problem, impact parameters are assigned to these scattering angles. The new method, which no longer contains empirical considerations, is tested calculating by fully differential ionization cross sections for single ionization of helium produced by fast C$^{6+}$ ions.",Human
"The ATLAS pixel detector is a high precision silicon tracking device located closest to the LHC interaction point. It belongs to the first generation of its kind in a hadron collider experiment. It will provide crucial pattern recognition information and will largely determine the ability of ATLAS to precisely track particle trajectories and find secondary vertices. It was the last detector to be installed in ATLAS in June 2007, has been fully connected and tested in-situ during spring and summer 2008. It is currently in a commissioning phase using cosmic-ray events. We present the highlights of the past and future commissioning activities of the ATLAS pixel system.",Human
"The aim of this work is to implement a statistical mechanics theory of social interaction, generalizing econometric discrete choice models. A class of simple mean field discrete models is introduced and discussed both from the theoretical and phenomenological point of view. We propose a parameter evaluation procedure and test it by fitting our model against three families of data coming from different cases: the estimated interaction parameters are found to have similar positive values establishing a quantitative confirmation of the peer imitation behavior found in social psychology. Moreover all the values of the interaction parameters belong to the phase transition regime suggesting its possible role in the study of social systems.",Human
Three-body resonances in atomic systems are calculated as complex-energy solutions of Faddeev-type integral equations. The homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations are solved by approximating the potential terms in a Coulomb-Sturmian basis. The Coulomb-Sturmian matrix elements of the three-body Coulomb Green's operator has been calculated as a contour integral of two-body Coulomb Green's matrices. This approximation casts the integral equation into a matrix equation and the complex energies are located as the complex zeros of the Fredholm determinant. We calculated resonances of the e-Ps system at higher energies and for total angular momentum L=1 with natural and unnatural parity,Human
"We exploit theoretically the occurrence and tunability of photonic Bloch oscillations (PBOs) in one-dimensional photonic crystals (PCs) containing nonlinear composites. Because of the enhanced third-order nonlinearity (Kerr type nonlinearity) of composites, photons undergo oscillations inside tilted photonic bands, which are achieved by the application of graded external pump electric fields on such PCs, varying along the direction perpendicular to the surface of layers. The tunability of PBOs (including amplitude and period) is readily achieved by changing the field gradient. With an appropriate graded pump AC or DC electric field, terahertz PBOs can appear and cover a terahertz band in electromagnetic spectrum.",Human
"We report a new experimental scheme which combines atom interferometry with Bloch oscillations to provide a new measurement of the ratio $h/m_{\mathrm{Rb}}$. By using Bloch oscillations, we impart to the atoms up to 1600 recoil momenta and thus we improve the accuracy on the recoil velocity measurement. The deduced value of $h/m_{\mathrm{Rb}}$ leads to a new determination of the fine structure constant $\alpha^{-1}=137.035 999 45 (62)$ with a relative uncertainty of $4.6\times 10^{-9}$. The comparison of this result with the value deduced from the measurement of the electron anomaly provides the most stringent test of QED.",Human
"The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will face the challenge of efficiently selecting interesting candidate events in $pp$ collisions at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy, whilst rejecting the enormous number of background events. Therefore it is equipped with a three level trigger system. The first level is is hardware based and uses coarse granularity calorimeter information and fast readout muon chambers. The second and third level triggers, which are software based, will need to reduce the first level trigger output rate of ~ 75 kHz to ~ 200 Hz written out to mass storage. The progress in commissioning of this system will be reviewed in this paper.",Human
"Since the quantum field theory treats a system of particles, there must be a distribution which is associated with the system of particles. It means that a meaningful quantity is adjoined in the system of particles. It seems that these concepts, constraints and distribution are ignored in the conventional approach. Further more, there are two versions of quantization relations, one is prior to the field equation and the other is posterior to the field equation. And it is very difficult to find the posterior one. If the posterior one is found, of course, these two versions of quantization must be the same one. Actually, it implies that there is recursive problem. In this paper, we will discuss these serious problems.",Human
"We briefly present the eXtremely Fast Tracker stereo track upgrade for the CDF Level 2 trigger system. This upgrade enabled full 3D track reconstruction at Level 2 of the 3-Level CDF online triggering system. Using information provided by the stereo layers of the Central Outer Tracker, we can decrease the trigger rate due to fake tracks by requiring the tracks to be consistent with a single vertex in all three dimensions but also by using the track information to ""point"" to the various detector components. We will also discuss the effectiveness of the Level 2 stereo track algorithm at achieving reduced trigger rates with high efficiencies during high luminosity running.",Human
"We show that various types of equilibrium play an important part in the behaviour of the troposphere. In analogy to the electro-chemical potential (well-known in solid-state physics and electro-chemistry) a gravito-chemical potential and a gravito-thermo-chemical potential, as well as the corresponding equilibria are introduced. We shall show that (a) the isothermal atmosphere is characterized by a constant gravito-chemical potential; (b) the well-mixed or adiabatic atmosphere is characterized by a constant gravito-thermo-chemical potential. Thus, a linear decrease of the temperature with the vertical coordinate corresponds to a state of equilibrium.",Human
"A direct Biot-Savart integration is used to decompose the strain rate into its local and nonlocal constituents, allowing the vorticity alignment with the local and nonlocal strain rate eigenvectors to be investigated. These strain rate tensor constituents are evaluated in a turbulent flow using data from highly-resolved direct numerical simulations. While the vorticity aligns preferentially with the intermediate eigenvector of the \textit{combined} strain rate, as has been observed previously, the present results for the first time clearly show that the vorticity aligns with the most extensional eigenvector of the \textit{nonlocal} strain rate. This in turn reveals a significant linear contribution to the vortex stretching dynamics in turbulent flows.",Human
"The HeH$^+$ cation undergoes dissociative recombination with a free electron to produce neutral He and H fragments. We present calculations using ab initio quantum defects and Fano's rovibrational frame transformation technique, along with the methodology of PRL 89, 263003 (2002), to obtain the recombination rate both in the low-energy (1-300 meV) and high-energy (ca. 0.6 hartree) regions. We obtain very good agreement with experimental results, demonstrating that this relatively simple method is able to reproduce observed rates for both indirect dissociative recombination, driven by rovibrationally autoionizing states in the low-energy region, and direct dissociative recombination, driven by electronically autoionizing Rydberg states attached to higher-energy excited cation channels.",Human
Experiments on a chain of coupled pendula driven periodically at one end demonstrate the existence of a novel regime which produces an output frequency at an odd fraction of the driving frequency. The new stationary state is then obtained on numerical simulations and modeled with an analytical solution of the continuous sine-Gordon equation that resembles a kink-like motion back and forth in the restricted geometry of the chain. This solution differs from the expressions used to understand nonlinear bistability where the synchronization constraint was the basic assumption. As a result the short pendula chain is shown to possess tristable stationary states and to act as a frequency divider.,Human
"We study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in one-dimensional chirped periodic structures composed of alternating layers of negative-index (or left-handed) metamaterial and conventional dielectric, under the condition of the zero average refractive index. We consider the case when the periodic structure has a linear chirp, and the chirp is introduced by varying linearly the thickness of the layers across the structure. We apply an asymptotic analytical method for the analysis of the Bloch oscillations and find that, in a sharp contrast to ordinary periodic dielectric structures, the energy flow in multi-layered stacks with metamaterials may have the opposite direction at the band edges, thus providing novel possibilities for the beam steering in the transmission band.",Human
The human society today is far from perfection and conflicts between groups of humans are frequent events. One example for such conflicts are armed intergroup conflicts. The collective behavior of the large number of cooperating participants in these conflicts allows us to describe the conflict on the basis of models containing only few variables. In this paper we discuss several cases of conflicts without use of weapons of non-conventional kind. In the ancient times the Chinese writer Sun Tsu mentioned that the war is an art. We can confirm that the conflict is an art but with much mathematics at the background.,Human
"Solar forcing on climate has been reported in several studies although the evidence so far remains inconclusive. Here, we analyze the stream flow of one of the largest rivers in the world, the Parana in southeastern South America. For the last century, we find a strong correlation with the sunspot number, in multidecadal time scales, and with larger solar activity corresponding to larger stream flow. The correlation coefficient is r=0.78, significant to a 99% level. In shorter time scales we find a strong correlation with El Nino. These results are a step toward flood prediction, which might have great social and economic impacts.",Human
"Photoluminescence of polycrystalline hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was measured by means of time- and energy-resolved spectroscopy methods. The observed bands are related to DAP transitions, impurities and structural defects. The excitation of samples by high-energy photons above 5.4 eV enables a phenomenon of photostimulated luminescence (PSL), which is due to distantly trapped CB electrons and VB holes. These trapped charges are metastable and their reexcitation with low-energy photons results in anti-Stockes photoluminescence. The comparison of photoluminescence excitation spectra and PSL excitation spectra allows band analysis that supports the hypothesis of Frenkel-like exciton in hBN with a large binding energy.",Human
A regime of multi-cascade proton acceleration in the interaction of $10^{21}-10^{22}$ W/cm$^2$ laser pulse with a structured target is proposed. The regime is based on the electron charge displacement under the action of laser ponderomotive force and on the effect of relativistically induced slab transparency which allows to realize idea of multi-cascade acceleration. It is shown that a target comprising several properly spaced apart thin foils can optimize the acceleration process and give at the output quasi-monoenergetic beams of protons with energies up to hundreds of MeV with energy spread of just few percent.,Human
"We identify the statistical characterizers of congestion and decongestion for message transport in model communication lattices. These turn out to be the travel time distributions, which are Gaussian in the congested phase, and log-normal in the decongested phase. Our results are demonstrated for two dimensional lattices, such the Waxman graph, and for lattices with local clustering and geographic separations, gradient connections, as well as for a 1-d ring lattice with random assortative connections. The behavior of the distribution identifies the congested and decongested phase correctly for these distinct network topologies and decongestion strategies. The waiting time distributions of the systems also show identical signatures of the congested and decongested phases.",Human
Light propagation in a medium made of densely packed dielectric spheres is investigated by using a rigorous diffraction theory. It is shown that a substantial suppression of the local density of states occurs in spectral domains where the single constituents exhibit Mie resonances. The local density of states decreases exponentially at the pertinent frequencies with a linearly increasing spatial extension of the aggregated spheres. It is shown that a self-sustaining random arrangement of core-shell spheres shows the same fundamental characteristics. Such approach offers a path towards easy to fabricate photonic materials with omnidirectional gaps that may find use in various applications.,Human
"We investigate the possibility of detecting the Podolsky generalized electrodynamics constant $a$. First we analyze an ion interferometry apparatus proposed by B. Neyenhuis, et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, (2007) 200401) who looked for deviations from Coulomb's inverse-square law in the context of Proca model. Our results show that this experiment has not enough precision for measurements of $a$. In order to set up bounds for $a$ we investigate the influence of Podolsky's electrostatic potential on the ground state of the Hydrogen atom. The value of the ground state energy of the Hydrogen atom requires Podolsky's constant to be smaller than 5.6 fm, or in energy scales larger than 35.51 MeV.",Human
"We study a process of opinion formation in a population of agents whose interaction pattern is defined on the basis of randomly distributed groups of three agents, or triplets -in contrast to networks, which are defined on the basis of agent pairs. Results for the time needed to reach full consensus are compared between a triplet-based structure with a given number of triplets and a random network with the same number of triangles. The full-consensus time in the triplet structure is systematically lower than in the network. This discrepancy can be ascribed to differences in the shape of the probability distribution for the number of triplets and triangles per agent in each interaction pattern.",Human
"The interference of polariton guiding modes propagating through ""traffic circle"" waveguides composed of dielectric spherical particles is investigated. The dependence of intensity of the wave on the position of the particle was studied using the multisphere the Mie scattering formalism. We show that if the frequency of light belongs to the passband of the waveguide, electromagnetic waves may be considered as two optical beams running along a circle in opposite directions and interfering with each other. Indeed, the obtained intensity behavior can be represented as a simple superposition of two waves propagating around a circle in opposite directions. The applications of this interference are discussed.",Human
We present a method for measuring electrical currents enclosed by flux rope structures that are ejected within solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Such currents are responsible for providing the Lorentz self-force that propels CMEs. Our estimates for the driving current are based on measurements of the propelling force obtained using data from the LASCO coronagraphs aboard the SOHO satellite. We find that upper limits on the currents enclosed by CMEs are typically around $10^{10}$ Amperes. We estimate that the magnetic flux enclosed by the CMEs in the LASCO field of view is a few $\times 10^{21}$ Mx.,Human
"Hidden Markov Processes (HMP) is one of the basic tools of the modern probabilistic modeling. The characterization of their entropy remains however an open problem. Here the entropy of HMP is calculated via the cycle expansion of the zeta-function, a method adopted from the theory of dynamical systems. For a class of HMP this method produces exact results both for the entropy and the moment-generating function. The latter allows to estimate, via the Chernoff bound, the probabilities of large deviations for the HMP. More generally, the method offers a representation of the moment-generating function and of the entropy via convergent series.",Human
"This essay suggests that a proper assessment of the presently unfolding financial crisis, and its cure, requires going back at least to the late 1990s, accounting for the cumulative effect of the ITC, real-estate and financial derivative bubbles. We focus on the deep loss of trust, not only in Wall Street, but more importantly in Main Street, and how to recover it on the short and long terms. A multi-disciplinary approach is needed to deal with the nonlinear complex systems of the present world, in order to develop a culture of fairness, and of upside opportunities associated with a risky world.",Human
"The present paper deals with the study of spectral properties of the helical mode of uniform isotropic turbulence in the presence and in the absence of mean helicity. It is shown that even in the absence of mean helicity, the helicity of individual helical modes affects the spectral behavior of turbulence. Besides, it is shown that both in the presence and in the absence of mean helicity, intermediate characteristic scales connected with the presence of helicity in helical modes should exist. The existence of these scales makes it possible to solve the problem of helicity dissipation divergence for individual helical modes.",Human
"We study the relation between serial correlation of financial returns and volatility at intraday level for the S&P500 stock index. At daily and weekly level, serial correlation and volatility are known to be negatively correlated (LeBaron effect). While confirming that the LeBaron effect holds also at intraday level, we go beyond it and, complementing the efficient market hyphotesis (for returns) with the heterogenous market hyphotesis (for volatility), we test the impact of unexpected volatility, defined as the part of volatility which cannot be forecasted, on the presence of serial correlations in the time series. We show that unexpected volatility is instead positively correlated with intraday serial correlation.",Human
"We consider single ionization of helium by fast highly charged ions. The ionization is treated as a three-body problem which involves the 'active' target electron, the target core (consisting of the target nucleus and the 'passive' target electron) and the projectile-ion. We show that, unless the transverse momentum transfer in the collision is large, the deviation of the interaction between the projectile and the target core from the purely coulomb law has a weak effect on the ionization. In particular, the account of this deviation does not enable one to get an agreement with experimental data on the fully differential cross section for the electron emission into the so called perpendicular plane.",Human
"A stochastic model is here introduced to investigate the molecular mechanisms which trigger the perception of pain. The action of analgesic drug compounds is discussed in a dynamical context, where the competition with inactive species is explicitly accounted for. Finite size effects inevitably perturb the mean-field dynamics: Oscillations in the amount of bound receptors spontaneously manifest, driven by the noise which is intrinsic to the system under scrutiny. These effects are investigated both numerically, via stochastic simulations and analytically, through a large-size expansion. The claim that our findings could provide a consistent interpretative framework to explain the emergence of cyclic behaviors in response to analgesic treatments, is substantiated.",Human
"We derive the paraxial meridional ray tracing equations from the unified reflection-refraction law using geometric algebra. This unified law states that the normal vector to the interface is a rotation of the incident ray or of the refracted ray or of the reflected ray by an angle equal to the angle of incidence or of refraction. We obtain the finite meridional ray tracing equations by simply equating the arguments of the exponential rotation operators. We then derive the paraxial limits of these equations with the help of sign function identities. We show that by embedding the sign functions in the ray tracing equations, we explicitly declare our chosen sign conventions in symbols and not in prose.",Human
"Power grids exhibit patterns of reaction to outages similar to complex networks. Blackout sequences follow power laws, as complex systems operating near a critical point. Here, the tolerance of electric power grids to both accidental and malicious outages is analyzed in the framework of complex network theory. In particular, the quantity known as efficiency is modified by introducing a new concept of distance between nodes. As a result, a new parameter called net-ability is proposed to evaluate the performance of power grids. A comparison between efficiency and net-ability is provided by estimating the vulnerability of sample networks, in terms of both the metrics.",Human
"We consider an inertial model of chemotactic aggregation generalizing the Keller-Segel model and we study the linear dynamical stability of an infinite and homogeneous distribution of cells (bacteria, amoebae, endothelial cells,...) when inertial effects are accounted for. These inertial terms model cells directional persistance. We determine the condition of instability and the growth rate of the perturbation as a function of the cell density and the wavelength of the perturbation. We discuss the differences between overdamped (Keller-Segel) and inertial models. Finally, we show the analogy between the instability criterion for biological populations and the Jeans instability criterion in astrophysics.",Human
"We discuss the simulations of the norm game between players at nodes of a directed random network. The final boldness of the players can vary with the initial one as the $\Theta$ function. One of the conditions of this behaviour is that the player who does not punish automatically becomes a defector. The threshold value of the initial boldness can be interpreted as a norm strength. It increases with the punishment and decreases with its cost. Surprisingly, it also decreases with the number of potential punishers. The numerical results are discussed in the context of the statistical data on crimes in Northern Ireland and New Zealand, on divorces in USA, and on the alcohol consumption in Poland.",Human
"In this paper we develop two mathematical models to predict the release kinetics of a water soluble drug from a polymer/excipient matrix tablet. The first of our models consists of a random walk on a weighted graph, where the vertices of the graph represent particles of drug, excipient and polymer, respectively. The graph itself is the contact graph of a multidisperse random sphere packing. The second model describes the dissolution and the subsequent diffusion of the active drug out of a porous matrix using a system of partial differential equations. The predictions of both models show good qualitative agreement with experimental release curves. The models will provide tools for designing better controlled release devices.",Human
"Eukaryotic cells possess a sensible chemical compass allowing them to orient toward sources of soluble chemicals. The extracellular chemical signal triggers separation of the cell membrane into two domains populated by different phospholipid molecules and oriented along the signal anisotropy. We propose a theory of this polarization process, which is articulated into subsequent stages of germ nucleation, patch coarsening and merging into a single domain. We find that the polarization time, $t_\epsilon$, depends on the anisotropy degree $\epsilon$ through the power law $t_\epsilon\propto \epsilon^{-2}$, and that in a cell of radius $R$ there should exist a threshold value $\epsilon_\mathrm{th}\propto R^{-1}$ for the smallest detectable anisotropy.",Human
"Propagation equations for optical pulses are needed to assist in describing applications in ever more extreme situations -- including those in metamaterials with linear and nonlinear magnetic responses. Here I show how to derive a single first order propagation equation using a minimum of approximations and a straightforward ""factorization"" mathematical scheme. The approach generates exact coupled bi-directional equations, after which it is clear that the description can be reduced to a single uni-directional first order wave equation by means of a simple ""slow evolution"" approximation, where the optical pulse changes little over the distance of one wavelength. It also also allows a direct term-to-term comparison of an exact bi-directional theory with the approximate uni-directional theory.",Human
"The magnetic octupole moment of 87Rb is determined from hyperfine intervals in the 5p 2P[3/2] state measured by Ye et al. [Opt. Lett. 21, 1280 (1996)]. Hyperfine constants A = 84.7189(22) MHz, B = 12.4942(43) MHz, and C = -0.12(09) kHz are obtained from the published measurements. The existence of a significant value for C indicates the presence of a nuclear magnetic octupole moment Omega. Combining the hyperfine constants with atomic structure calculations, we obtain Omega = -0.58(39) (b muN). Second-order corrections arising from interaction with the nearby 5p 2P[1/2] state are found to be insignificant.",Human
"Opinion Dynamics lacks a theoretical basis. In this article, I propose to use a decision-theoretic framework, based on the updating of subjective probabilities, as that basis. We will see we get a basic tool for a better understanding of the interaction between the agents in Opinion Dynamics problems and for creating new models. I will review the few existing applications of Bayesian update rules to both discrete and continuous opinion problems and show that several traditional models can be obtained as special cases or approximations from these Bayesian models. The empirical basis and useful properties of the framework will be discussed and examples of how the framework can be used to describe different problems given.",Human
"The construction of fractal generalized zone plates (FraGZPs) from a set of periodic diffractive optical elements with circular symmetry is proposed. This allows us to increase the number of foci of a conventional fractal zone plate (FraZP), keeping the self-similarity property within the axial irradiance. The focusing properties of these fractal diffractive optical elements for points not only along but also in the close vicinity of the optical axis are investigated. In both cases analytical expressions for the irradiance are derived. Numerical simulations of the energetic efficiency of FraGZPs under plane wave illumination are carried out. In addition, some effects on the axial irradiance caused by the variation in area of their transparent rings are shown.",Human
"This is the second of a series of papers devoted to develop a microscopical approach to the dipole emission process and its relation to coherent transport in random media. In this Letter, we deduce a relation between the transverse decay rate of an emitter in a virtual cavity and the complex refraction index of the host medium. We argue on the possibility of a criterion for inhibition/enhancement of spontaneous emission in function of the transition frequency and the correlation length of the host scatterers. In addition, we study the radiative/non-radiative nature of the net power emission through a microscopical analysis of the scattering events involved. This study reveals essential discrepancies with previous interpretations.",Human
"SQUID-based MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) at microtesla fields has developed significantly over the past few years. Here we describe application of this method for magnetic relaxation measurements in the living human brain. We report values of the longitudinal relaxation time T1 for brain tissues, measured in vivo for the first time at microtesla fields. The experiments were performed at 46 microtesla field using a seven-channel SQUID system designed for microtesla MRI and MEG. Values of T1, measured for different tissues at this field, are found to be close (within 5%) to the corresponding values of the transverse relaxation time T2 at the same field. Implications of this result for imaging contrast in microtesla MRI are discussed.",Human
"A method for solving model nonlinear equations describing plasma oscillations in the presence of viscosity and resistivity is given. By first going to the Lagrangian variables and then transforming the space variable conveniently, the solution in parametric form is obtained. It involves simple elementary functions. Our solution includes all known exact solutions for an ideal cold plasma and a large class of new ones for a more realistic plasma. A new nonlinear effect is found of splitting of the largest density maximum, with a saddle point between the peaks so obtained. The method may sometimes be useful where Inverse Scattering fails.",Human
"We study the dipole-dipole spectral broadening of a resonance line at high atomic densities when the self-broadening dominates. The selective reflection spectrum of a weak probe beam from the interface of the cell window and rubidium vapor are recorded in the presence of a far-detuned pump beam. The excitation due to the pump reduces the self-broadening. We found that the self-broadening reduction dependence on the pump power is atomic density independent. These results provide experimental evidence for the disordered exciton based theory of self-broadening, and can be useful for the description of the interaction of a strong optical field with a dense resonance medium.",Human
"Energy exchanges due to chemical reactions between a silicon surface and a SF6 plasma were directly measured using a heat flux microsensor (HFM). The energy flux evolution was compared with those obtained when only few reactions occur at the surface to show the part of chemical reactions. At 800 W, the measured energy flux due to chemical reactions is estimated at about 7 W.cm\^{-2} against 0.4 W.cm\^{-2} for ion bombardment and other contributions. Time evolution of the HFM signal is also studied. The molar enthalpy of the reaction giving SiF4 molecules was evaluated and is consistent with values given in literature.",Human
"Using the idea of transformation optics, we propose a metamaterial device that serves as a frequency-selective super-absorber, which consists of an absorbing core material coated with a shell of isotropic double negative metamaterial. For a fixed volume, the absorption cross section of the super-absorber can be made arbitrarily large at one frequency. The double negative shell serves to amplify the evanescent tail of the high order incident cylindrical waves, which induces strong scattering and absorption. Our conclusion is supported by both analytical Mie theory and numerical finite element simulation. Interesting applications of such a device are discussed.",Human
"The one-dimensional motion of any number $\cN$ of particles in the field of many independent waves (with strong spatial correlation) is formulated as a second-order system of stochastic differential equations, driven by two Wiener processes. In the limit of vanishing particle mass ${\mathfrak{m}} \to 0$, or equivalently of large noise intensity, we show that the momenta of all $N$ particles converge weakly to $N$ independent Brownian motions, and this convergence holds even if the noise is periodic. This justifies the usual application of the diffusion equation to a family of particles in a unique stochastic force field. The proof rests on the ergodic properties of the relative velocity of two particles in the scaling limit.",Human
"We show that alternative relativity theories that are essentially based on varied distant clock synchronization procedures can be recovered by using the standard Lorentz-Einstein transformations for the space-time coordinates of the same event. Through this approach we offer modest support for the Rizzi et al. stating that: ""Once correctly and explicitly phrased, the principles of special relativity theory allow for a wide range of theories that differ from the standard Einstein's theory only for the difference in the chosen synchronization procedure, but are wholly equivalent to special relativity theory in predicting empirical facts."" Our approach requires of the reader no more then a correct understanding of the physics behind the Lorentz-Einstein transformations equations which we use.",Human
"We propose a multi-scale approach to understand the physics related to ion-beam cancer therapy. It allows the calculation of the probability of DNA damage as a result of irradiation of tissues with energetic ions, up to 430 MeV/u. This approach covers different scales, starting from the large scale, defined by the ion stopping, followed by a smaller scale, defined by secondary electrons and radicals, and ending with the shortest scale, defined by interactions of secondaries with the DNA. We present calculations of the probabilities of single and double strand breaks of DNA, suggest a way to further expand such calculations, and also make some estimates for glial cells exposed to radiation.",Human
We report an algorithm for the partition of a line segment according to a given ratio $\nu$. At each step the length distribution among sets of the partition follows a binomial distribution. We call $k$-set to the set of elements with the same length at the step $n$. The total number of elements is $2^n$ and the number of elements in a same $k$-set is $C_n^k$. In the limit of an infinite partion this object become a multifractal where each $k$-set originate a fractal. We find the fractal spectrum $D_k$ and calculate where is its maximum. Finally we find the values of $D_k$ for the limits $k/n \to 0$ and 1.,Human
"Pixelated Photon Detectors (PPDs) are the most promising semiconductor photodetectors in recent years. One of the issues with the PPD is its high noise rate. As well as random noise, PPD also exhibits so called after-pulsing and optical crosstalk, and these limit the applicable range of its gain as well as its size. By accurately measuring each of these causes of noises independently, we quantitatively evaluated how the performance of the present device is limited by multiplication effect of these noises. With this result and the pulsing mechanism of PPD, we propose a new structure of PPD which could have high gain with low noise.",Human
"We study the effect of latency on binary-choice opinion formation models. Latency is introduced into the models as an additional dynamic rule: after a voter changes its opinion, it enters a waiting period of stochastic length where no further changes take place. We first focus on the voter model and show that as a result of introducing latency, the average magnetization is not conserved, and the system is driven toward zero magnetization, independently of initial conditions. The model is studied analytically in the mean-field case and by simulations in one dimension. We also address the behavior of the Majority Rule model with added latency, and show that the competition between imitation and latency leads to a rich phenomenology.",Human
"We present a formalism for rigorous calculations of cross sections for inelastic and reactive collisions of ultracold atoms and molecules confined by laser fields in quasi-2D geometry. Our results show that the elastic-to-inelastic ratios of collision cross sections are enhanced in the presence of a laser confinement and that the threshold energy dependence of the collision cross sections can be tuned by varying the confinement strength and external magnetic fields. The enhancement of the elastic-to-inelastic ratios is inversely proportional to $\sqrt{\epsilon/\hbar \omega_0}$, where $\epsilon$ is the kinetic energy and $\omega_0$ is the oscillation frequency of the trapped particles in the confinement potential.",Human
"Raman amplification of a short laser pulse off a long laser beam has been demonstrated successfully for moderate probe intensities ($\sim 10^{16}$ W/cm$^2$) and widths ($\sim 50$ micron). However, truly competitive intensities can only be reached if the amplification process is carried out at much higher probe intensities ($10^{17}-10^{18}$ W/cm$^2$ after amplification) and widths (1-10 mm). In this paper we examine the opportunities and challenges provided by this regime through the first 2-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations using wide pulses. A parameter window is identified in which a 10 TW, 600 $\mu$m wide, 25 ps long laser pulse can be efficiently amplified to 2 PW peak intensity.",Human
"We show that the spins of all electrons, each confined in a quantum dot of an (In,Ga)As/GaAs dot ensemble, can be driven into a single mode of precession about a magnetic field. This regime is achieved by allowing only a single mode within the electron spin precession spectrum of the ensemble to be synchronized with a train of periodic optical excitation pulses. Under this condition a nuclei induced frequency focusing leads to a shift of all spin precession frequencies into the synchronized mode. The macroscopic magnetic moment of the electron spins that is created in this regime precesses without dephasing.",Human
"We demonstrate a precision frequency measurement using a phase-stabilized 120-km optical fiber link over a physical distance of 50 km. The transition frequency of the 87Sr optical lattice clock at the University of Tokyo is measured to be 429228004229874.1(2.4) Hz referenced to international atomic time (TAI). The measured frequency agrees with results obtained in Boulder and Paris at a 6*10^-16 fractional level, which matches the current best evaluations of Cs primary frequency standards. The results demonstrate the excellent functions of the intercity optical fibre link, and the great potential of optical lattice clocks for use in the redefinition of the second.",Human
We investigate the angular distribution of positrons in the coherent process electronpositron pair creation process by high-energy photons in a periodically deformed single crystal with a complex base. The formula for the corresponding differential cross-section is derived for an arbitrary deformation field. The case is considered in detail when the photon enters into the crystal at small angles with respect to a crystallographic axis. The results of the numerical calculations are presented for${\mathrm{SiO}}_{2}$ and diamond single crystals and Moliere parameterization of the screened atomic potentials in the case of the deformation field generated by the acoustic wave of S-type.,Human
"We report the observation of wave turbulence on the surface of a ferrofluid mechanically forced and submitted to a static normal magnetic field. We show that magnetic surface waves arise only above a critical field. The power spectrum of their amplitudes displays a frequency-power law leading to the observation of a magnetic wave turbulence regime which is experimentally shown to involve a 4-wave interaction process. The existence of the regimes of gravity, magnetic and capillary wave turbulence is reported in the phase space parameters as well as a triple point of coexistence of these three regimes. Most of these features are understood using dimensional analysis or the dispersion relation of the ferrohydrodynamics surface waves.",Human
"The beam calorimeter, located in the very forward and backward region of the next generation electron-positron linear accelerator, will be an important apparatus to search for or identify new particles beyond Standard Model. One of its key design issues is to estimate the radiation dosage due to beam related backgrounds. We used the geant-based package, Jupiter, for the proposed GLD detector in this study. The dosage received per year for the inner most ring will be around 10 Mrad. An algorithm for electron identification with beam calorimeter under nominal background condition is developed and is used for the feasibility study of smuon search. The result is satisfactory.",Human
"""Streamers, sprites, leaders, lightning: from micro- to macroscales"" was the theme of a workshop in October 2007 in Leiden, The Netherlands; it brought researchers from plasma physics, electrical engineering and industry, geophysics and space physics, computational science and nonlinear dynamics together around the common topic of generation, structure and products of streamer-like electric breakdown. The present cluster issue collects relevant articles within this area; most of them were presented during the workshop. We here briefly discuss the research questions and very shortly review the papers in the cluster issue, and we also refer to a few recent papers in other journals.",Human
A simulated annealing based algorithm is presented for the determination of optimal ship routes through the minimization of a cost function. This cost function is a weighted sum of the time of voyage and the voyage comfort (safety is taken into account too). The latter is dependent on both the wind speed and direction and the wave height and direction. The algorithm first discretizes an initial route and optimizes it by considering small deviations which are accepted by utilizing the simulated annealing technique. Using calculus of variations we prove a key theorem which dramatically accelerates the convergence of the algorithm. Finally both simulated and real experiments are presented.,Human
"Human history leaves fingerprints in human languages. Little is known over language evolution and its study is of great importance. Here, we construct a simple stochastic model and compare its results to statistical data of real languages. The model bases on the recent findings that language changes occur independently on the population size. We find agreement with the data additionally assuming that languages may be distinguished by having at least one among a finite, small number of different features. This finite set is used also in order to define the distance between two languages, similarly to linguistics tradition since Swadesh.",Human
Variational principles for magnetohydrodynamics were introduced by previous authors both in Lagrangian and Eulerian form. In a previous work Yahalom & Lynden-Bell introduced a simpler Eulerian variational principles from which all the relevant equations of magnetohydrodynamics can be derived. The variational principle was given in terms of six independent functions for non-stationary flows and three independent functions for stationary flows. This is less then the seven variables which appear in the standard equations of magnetohydrodynamics which are the magnetic field $\vec B$ the velocity field $\vec v$ and the density $\rho$. In this work I will improve on the previous results showing that non-stationary magnetohydrodynamics should be described by four functions .,Human
"Detecting communities in complex networks accurately is a prime challenge, preceding further analyses of network characteristics and dynamics. Until now, community detection took into account only positively valued links, while many actual networks also feature negative links. We extend an existing Potts model to incorporate negative links as well, resulting in a method similar to the clustering of signed graphs, as dealt with in social balance theory, but more general. To illustrate our method, we applied it to a network of international alliances and disputes. Using data from 1993--2001, it turns out that the world can be divided into six power blocs similar to Huntington's civilizations, with some notable exceptions.",Human
A prototype Silicon-Tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) for an International Linear Collider (ILC) detector was installed and tested during summer and autumn 2006 at CERN. The detector had 6480 silicon pads of dimension 1x1 cm^2. Data were collected with electron beams in the energy range 6 to 45 GeV. The analysis described in this paper focuses on electromagnetic shower reconstruction and characterises the ECAL response to electrons in terms of energy resolution and linearity. The detector is linear to within approximately the 1% level and has a relative energy resolution of (16.6 +- 0.1)/ \sqrt{E(GeV}) + 1.1 +- 0.1 (%). The spatial uniformity and the time stability of the ECAL are also addressed.,Human
"A highly granular hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) based on scintillator tiles with individual readout by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) has been constructed by the CALICE collaboration and has been tested extensively in particle beams at CERN. The 7608 SiPMs coupled to scintillator tiles in the approximately 1 cubic meter large calorimeter allow large sample studies of behavior of these devices under varying voltage and temperature as well as their saturation behavior. We also present detailed studies of the temperature dependence of the calorimeter signal in muon and hadron beams. The calibration of the full calorimeter using muons is discussed. In addition, a novel method for calibration and detector studies using minimum-ionizing track segments in hadronic showers, is explored.",Human
"We propose a new method for the production of ultracold molecular ions. This method utilizes sympathetic cooling due to the strong collisions between appropriately chosen molecular ions and laser-cooled neutral atoms to realize ultracold, internal ground-state molecular ions. In contrast to other experiments producing cold molecular ions, our proposed method efficiently cools both the internal and external molecular ion degrees of freedom. The availability of an ultracold, absolute ground-state sample of molecular ions would have broad impact to fields as diverse as quantum chemistry, astrophysics, and fundamental physics; and may lead to the development of a robust, scalable quantum computer.",Human
"Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) have been successfully used in several high energy physics experiments over the past two decades. Their high spatial resolution and thin sensitive layers make them an excellent tool for studying short-lived particles. The Linear Collider Flavour Identification (LCFI) collaboration is developing Column-Parallel CCDs (CPCCDs) for the vertex detector of a future Linear Collider. The CPCCDs can be read out many times faster than standard CCDs, significantly increasing their operating speed. A test stand for measuring the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) of a prototype CPCCD has been set up. Studies of the CTI have been performed at a range of readout frequencies and operating temperatures.",Human
"A stationary viscous jet falling from an oriented nozzle onto a moving surface is studied, both theoretically and experimentally. We distinguish three flow regimes and classify them by the convexity of the jet shape (concave, vertical and convex). The fluid is modeled as a Newtonian fluid, and the model for the flow includes viscous effects, inertia and gravity. By studying the characteristics of the conservation of momentum for a dynamic jet, the boundary conditions for each flow regime are derived, and the flow regimes are characterized in terms of the process and material parameters. The model is solved by a transformation into an algebraic equation. We make a comparison between the model and experiments, and obtain qualitative agreement.",Human
"Thomson's theorem states that static charge distributions in conductors only exist at the conducting surfaces in an equipotential configuration, yielding a minimal electrostatic energy. In this work we present a proof for this theorem based on the variational principle. Furthermore, an analogue statement for magnetic systems is also introduced and proven: the stored magnetic field energy reaches the minimum value for superficial current distributions so that the magnetic vector potential points in the same direction as the surface current. This is the counterpart of Thomson's theorem for the magnetic field. The result agrees with the fact that currents in superconductors are confined near the surface and indicates that the distinction between superconductors and hypothetical perfect conductors is fictitious.",Human
"Photoionization of the I$^+$ ion in the energy range of the 4d giant resonance has been studied using our recently developed random-phase approximation with exchange (RPAE) method. Photoionization cross sections for the I$^+$ $4d-\epsilon f, \epsilon p$, $5s-\epsilon p$, $5p-\epsilon s ,\epsilon d$ have been obtained for each term of the ground state. Calculations include all the intra-shell and inter-shell coupling among the 4d, $5s$, and $5p$ subshells. Our maximum cross section for the I$^+$ 4d giant resonance, 23.12 MB at 90.24 eV agrees excellently with the recent measurement, 23(3) at 90 eV.",Human
"The primary purpose of the Fermilab Recycler Ring Transverse Digital Damper System is to prevent instabilities due to high phase space densities of the cooled antiproton beam. The system was designed to facilitate Beam Transfer Function measurements using a signal analyzer connected to auxiliary system ports for timing and diagnostic purposes. The Digital Damper System has the capability for both open and closed loop measurements. The Beam Transfer Function provides direct measurement of the machine impedance, and beam and lattice parameters such as betatron tune and chromaticity. An overview of the technique is presented along with analysis and results from open and closed loop measurements in the Fermilab Recycler Ring.",Human
"We show that oscillating flow of a simple fluid in both the Newtonian and the non-Newtonian regime can be described by a universal function of a single dimensionless scaling parameter $\omega\tau$, where $\omega$ is the oscillation (angular) frequency and $\tau$ is the fluid relaxation-time; geometry and linear dimension bear no effect on the flow. Experimental energy dissipation data of mechanical resonators in a rarefied gas follow this universality closely in a broad linear dimension ($10^{-6}$ m$< L < 10^{-2}$ m) and frequency ($10^5$ Hz $< \omega/2\pi < 10^8$ Hz) range. Our results suggest a deep connection between flows of simple and complex fluids.",Human
"The dynamics of F=1 spinor condensates initially prepared in a double-well potential is studied in the mean field approach. It is shown that a small seed of $m=0$ atoms on a system with initially well separated m=1 and m=-1 condensates has a dramatic effect on their mixing dynamics, acting as an effective barrier for a remarkably long time. We show that this effect is due to the spinor character of the system, and provides an observable example of the interplay between the internal spin dynamics and the macroscopic evolution of the magnetization in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate.",Human
"$B$ functions are a class of relatively complicated exponentially decaying basis functions. Since the molecular multicenter integrals of the much simpler Slater-type functions are notoriously difficult, it is not at all obvious why $B$ functions should offer any advantages. However, $B$ functions have Fourier transforms of exceptional simplicity, which greatly simplifies many of their molecular multicenter integrals. This article discusses the historical development of $B$ functions from the perspective of the interaction between mathematics and theoretical chemistry, which traditionally has not been very good. Nevertheless, future progress in theoretical chemistry depends very much on a fertile interaction with neighboring disciplines.",Human
We propose the Subwavelength Localization via Adiabatic Passage (SLAP) technique to coherently achieve state-selective patterning of matter waves well beyond the diffraction limit. The SLAP technique consists in coupling two partially overlapping and spatially structured laser fields to three internal levels of the matter wave yielding state-selective localization at those positions where the adiabatic passage process does not occur. We show that by means of this technique matter wave localization down to the single nanometer scale can be achieved. We analyze in detail the potential implementation of the SLAP technique for nano-lithography with an atomic beam of metastable Ne* and for coherent patterning of a two-component 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate.,Human
"We present a simple theoretical framework to describe the thermal noise of a microscopic mechanical beam in a viscous fluid: we use the Sader approach to describe the effect of the surrounding fluid (added mass and viscous drag), and the fluctuation dissipation theorem for each flexural modes of the system to derive a general expression for the power spectrum density of fluctuations. This prediction is compared with an experimental measurement on a commercial atomic force microscopy cantilever in a frequency range covering the two first resonances. A very good agreement is found on the whole spectrum, with no adjustable parameters but the thickness of the cantilever.",Human
"We study the flow of an incompressible liquid film down a wavy incline. Applying a Galerkin method with only one ansatz function to the Navier-Stokes equations we derive a second order weighted residual integral boundary layer equation, which in particular may be used to describe eddies in the troughs of the wavy bottom. We present numerical results which show that our model is qualitatively and quantitatively accurate in wide ranges of parameters, and we use the model to study some new phenomena, for instance the occurrence of a short wave instability for laminar flows which does not exist over flat bottom.",Human
Most attempts to argue for the second law of thermodynamics fail because (1) they use the unviable frequency theory of probability and (2) they do not explain why the arrow of time seen in experiments is aligned with the thermodynamic arrow of time. I use the decision theoretic interpretation of quantum probability from the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to solve the probability problem. I then derive a correlation between the knowledge arrow of time and the entropy arrow of time using physical constraints on knowledge creation imposed by Popper's evolutionary theory of knowledge and the many worlds interpretation.,Human
"Useful approximation formulae for radiation impedance are given for the reflection coefficients of both infinitely flanged and unflanged rigid-walled cylindrical ducts. The expressions guarantee that simple but necessary physical and mathematical principles are met, like hermitian symmetry for the reflection coefficient (identical behaviour of positive and negative frequencies) and causality for the impulse response. A non causal but more accurate expression is also proposed that is suitable for frequency-domain applications. The formulae are obtained by analytical and numerical fitting to reference results from Levine & Schwinger for the unflanged case and extracted from the radiation impedance matrix given by Zorumski for the infinite flanged case.",Human
"For singular perturbation problems in dynamical systems, various appropriate singular perturbation methods have been proposed to eliminate secular terms appearing in the naive expansion. For example, the method of multiple time scales, the normal form method, center manifold theory, the renormalization group method are well known. In this paper, it is shown that all of the solutions of the reduced equations constructed with those methods are exactly equal to sum of the most divergent secular terms appearing in the naive expansion. For the proof, a method to construct a perturbation solution which differs from the conventional one is presented, where we make use of the theory of Lie symmetry group.",Human
"This brief survey analyzes the epistemological implications about the role of observer in the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics. As we know, the goal of most interpretations of quantum mechanics is to avoid the apparent intrusion of the observer into the measurement process. In the same time, there are implicit and hidden assumptions about his role. In fact, most interpretations taking as ontic level one of these fundamental concepts as information, physical law and matter bring us to new problematical questions. We think, that no interpretation of the quantum theory can avoid this intrusion until we do not clarify the nature of observer.",Human
"Radio-frequency electric-dipole transitions between nearly degenerate, opposite parity levels of atomic dysprosium (Dy) were monitored over an eight-month period to search for a variation in the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$. The data provide a rate of fractional temporal variation of $\alpha$ of $(-2.4\pm2.3)\times10^{-15}$ yr$^{-1}$ or a value of $(-7.8 \pm 5.9) \times 10^{-6}$ for $k_\alpha$, the variation coefficient for $\alpha$ in a changing gravitational potential. All results indicate the absence of significant variation at the present level of sensitivity. We also present initial results on laser cooling of an atomic beam of dysprosium.",Human
"In the context of the finite elasticity theory, we consider a model for compressible solids called 'compressible neo-Hookean material'. We show how finite-amplitude inhomogeneous plane wave solutions and finite-amplitude unattenuated solutions can combine to form a finite-amplitude Love wave. We take a layer of finite thickness overlying a solid half-space, both made of different prestressed compressible neo-Hookean materials. We derive an exact solution of the equations of motion and boundary conditions and also obtain results for the energy density and the energy flux of the waves. Finally, we investigate the special case when the interface between the layer and the substrate is in a principal plane of the prestrain. A numerical example is given.",Human
A comprehensive analysis of multiparticle emissions following photon induced reactions at intermediate energies is provided. Photon induced reaction is described in the energy range of $\sim 30-140$ MeV with an approach based on the quasideuteron nuclear photoabsorption model followed by the process of competition between light particle evaporation and fission for the excited nucleus. The evaporation-fission process of the compound nucleus is simulated in a Monte-Carlo framework. The study shows almost no fission events for the medium mass nuclei and reproduces satisfactorily well the available experimental data of photonuclear reaction cross sections at energies $\sim 30-140$ MeV.,Human
"In this paper we present an experimental framework to gather data on face-to-face social interactions between individuals, with a high spatial and temporal resolution. We use active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess contacts with one another by exchanging low-power radio packets. When individuals wear the beacons as a badge, a persistent radio contact between the RFID devices can be used as a proxy for a social interaction between individuals. We present the results of a pilot study recently performed during a conference, and a subsequent preliminary data analysis, that provides an assessment of our method and highlights its versatility and applicability in many areas concerned with human dynamics.",Human
"In the presented study, a numerical model which predicts the flow-induced collapse within the pharyngeal airway is validated using in vitro measurements. Theoretical simplifications were considered to limit the computation time. Systematic comparisons between simulations and measurements were performed on an in vitro replica, which reflects asymmetries of the geometry and of the tissue properties at the base of the tongue and in pathological conditions (strong initial obstruction). First, partial obstruction is observed and predicted. Moreover, the prediction accuracy of the numerical model is of 4.2% concerning the deformation (mean quadratic error on the constriction area). It shows the ability of the assumptions and method to predict accurately and quickly a fluid-structure interaction.",Human
"Evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game is studied where initially all players are linked via a regular graph, having four neighbors each. Simultaneously with the strategy evolution, players are allowed to make new connections and thus permanently extend their neighborhoods, provided they have been successful in passing their strategy to the opponents. We show that this simple coevolutionary rule shifts the survival barrier of cooperators towards high temptations to defect and results in highly heterogeneous interaction networks with an exponential fit best characterizing their degree distributions. In particular, there exist an optimal maximal degree for the promotion of cooperation, warranting the best exchange of information between influential players.",Human
"The self-similar decay of energy in a turbulent flow is studied in direct numerical simulations with and without rotation. Two initial conditions are considered: one non-helical (mirror-symmetric), and one with maximal helicity. The results show that, while in the absence of rotation the energy in the helical and non-helical cases decays with the same rate, in rotating flows the helicity content has a major impact on the decay rate. These differences are associated with differences in the energy and helicity cascades when rotation is present. Properties of the structures that arise in the flow at late times in each time are also discussed.",Human
"The dynamics of particles in turbulence when the particle-size is larger than the dissipative scale of the carrier flow is studied. Recent experiments have highlighted signatures of particles finiteness on their statistical properties, namely a decrease of their acceleration variance, an increase of correlation times -at increasing the particles size- and an independence of the probability density function of the acceleration once normalized to their variance. These effects are not captured by point particle models. By means of a detailed comparison between numerical simulations and experimental data, we show that a more accurate model is obtained once Faxen corrections are included.",Human
"We have developed an efficient algorithm for steady axisymmetrical 2D fluid equations. The algorithm employs multigrid method as well as standard implicit discretization schemes for systems of partial differential equations. Linearity of the multigrid method with respect to the number of grid points allowed us to use $256\times 256$ grid, where we could achieve solutions in several minutes. Time limitations due to nonlinearity of the system are partially avoided by using multi level grids(the initial solution on $256\times 256$ grid was extrapolated steady solution from $128\times 128$ grid which allowed using ""long"" integration time steps). The fluid solver may be used as the basis for hybrid codes for DC discharges.",Human
"Mixing of a passive scalar in the peripheral region close to a wall is investigated by means of accurate direct numerical simulations of both a three-dimensional Couette channel flow at low Reynolds numbers and a two-dimensional synthetic flow. In both cases, the resulting phenomenology can be understood in terms of the theory recently developed by Lebedev and Turitsyn [Phys. Rev. E 69, 036301, 2004]. Our results prove the robustness of the identified mechanisms responsible for the persistency of scalar concentration close to the wall with important consequences in completely different fields ranging from microfluidic applications to environmental dispersion modeling.",Human
"Acoustic wave generation by turbulence in the stratified, moist atmosphere is studied. It is shown that in the saturated moist air turbulence in addition to the Lighthill's quadrupole and the dipole sources of sound related to stratification and temperature fluctuations, there exist monopole sources related to heat and mass production during the condensation of moisture. We determine acoustic power of these monopole sources. Performed analysis shows that the monopole radiation is dominant for typical parameters of strong convective storms. Obtained results are in good qualitative agreement with the main observed characteristics of infrasound radiation by strong convective storms such as total acoustic power and characteristic frequency.",Human
"Finding the causes for the nonstatistical vibrational energy relaxation in the planar carbonyl sulfide (OCS) molecule is a longstanding problem in chemical physics: Not only is the relaxation incomplete long past the predicted statistical relaxation time, but it also consists of a sequence of abrupt transitions between long-lived regions of localized energy modes. We report on the phase space bottlenecks responsible for this slow and uneven vibrational energy flow in this Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom. They belong to a particular class of two-dimensional invariant tori which are organized around elliptic periodic orbits. We relate the trapping and transition mechanisms with the linear stability of these structures.",Human
"A two-dimension self-similar solution is proposed for a plasma expansion with anisotropic pressure. With the solution, it depends on the relationship between the ratio of the longitudinal and the transverse temperature of the plasma, $\kappa^2$ and the electron-ion mass ratio, $\mu$, that the plasma front is composed by a part of hyperbolic (or a plane) and a small pointed projection at the center or a part of an ellipse. Zhang and coworkers's experiments (PRL, 99, 167602 (2007))support our results for $\kappa^2\in(\tau,1]$. For $\kappa^2\leq\tau$, there is an anomalous high-energy plasma emission at the angle of near $90^{\text{o}}$ due to longitudinal Coulomb explosion.",Human
"In this work, it is suggested that the extremum complexity distribution of a high dimensional dynamical system can be interpreted as a piecewise uniform distribution in the phase space of its accessible states. When these distributions are expressed as one--particle distribution functions, this leads to piecewise exponential functions. It seems plausible to use these distributions in some systems out of equilibrium, thus greatly simplifying their description. In particular, here we study an isolated ideal monodimensional gas far from equilibrium that presents an energy distribution formed by two non--overlapping Gaussian distribution functions. This is demonstrated by numerical simulations. Also, some previous laboratory experiments with granular systems seem to display this kind of distributions.",Human
"We examine the evolution of paraxial beams carrying intrinsic spin and orbital angular momenta (AM) in gradient-index media. A parabolic-type equation is derived which describes the beam diffraction in curvilinear coordinates accompanying the central ray. The center of gravity of the beam experiences transverse AM-dependent deflections -- the spin and orbital Hall effects. The spin Hall effect generates a transverse translation of the beam as a whole, in precise agreement with recent geometrical optics predictions. At the same time, the orbital Hall effect is significantly affected by the diffraction in the inhomogeneous medium and is accompanied by changes in the intrinsic orbital AM and deformations of the beam.",Human
"Using spin 1/2 particle elastic scattering on a fixed target, in a 1/|x| potential on Euclidean metric, a minimum scattering cross section appears from the spin contribution. Interpreted as semi-classical limit of an earlier proposed operator formulation of four dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity, using non-associative complex octonion algebra, this is understood as an area quantum for the observation: Existence of finite (quantized) charges yields a minimum area element of interaction. This suggests that models built on the fundamental assumption of a quantized area element (namely as in Loop Quantum Gravity) may in principle approximate General Relativity in the non-quantum limit.",Human
"We demonstrate a technique for directly measuring the quadratic Zeeman shift using stimulated Raman transitions.The quadratic Zeeman shift has been measured yielding [delta][nju] = 1296.8 +/-3.3 Hz/G^{2} for magnetically insensitive sublevels (5S1/2, F = 2,mF = 0 -> 5S1/2, F = 3,mF = 0) of ^{85}Rb by compensating the magnetic eld and cancelling the ac Stark shift. We also measured the cancellation ratio of the differential ac Stark shift due to the imbalanced Raman beams by using two pairs of Raman beams ([sigma]^{+}, [sigma]^{+}) and it is 1:3.67 when the one-photon detuning is 1.5 GHz in the experiment.",Human
The use of data assimilation technique to identify optimal topography is discussed in frames of time-dependent motion governed by non-linear barotropic ocean model. Assimilation of artificially generated data allows to measure the influence of various error sources and to classify the impact of noise that is present in observational data and model parameters. The choice of assimilation window is discussed. Assimilating noisy data with longer windows provides higher accuracy of identified topography. The topography identified once by data assimilation can be successfully used for other model runs that start from other initial conditions and are situated in other parts of the model's attractor.,Human
"We address the problem of achieving an optical random laser with a cloud of cold atoms, in which gain and scattering are provided by the same atoms. The lasing threshold can be defined using the on-resonance optical thickness b0 as a single critical parameter. We predict the threshold quantitatively, as well as power and frequency of the emitted light, using two different light transport models and the atomic polarizability of a strongly-pumped two-level atom. We find a critical b0 on the order of 300, which is within reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments. Interestingly, we find that random lasing can already occur in a regime of relatively low scattering.",Human
"We investigate the role of electrothermal feedback in the operation of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). It is found that the desired mode of operation for SNSPDs is only achieved if this feedback is unstable, which happens naturally through the slow electrical response associated with their relatively large kinetic inductance. If this response is sped up in an effort to increase the device count rate, the electrothermal feedback becomes stable and results in an effect known as latching, where the device is locked in a resistive state and can no longer detect photons. We present a set of experiments which elucidate this effect, and a simple model which quantitatively explains the results.",Human
"Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a well established technique for producing coherent population transfer in a three-state quantum system. We here exploit the resemblance between the Schrodinger equation for such a quantum system and the Newton equation of motion for a classical system undergoing torque to discuss several classical analogs of STIRAP, notably the motion of a moving charged particle subject to the Lorentz force of a quasistatic magnetic field, the orientation of a magnetic moment in a slowly varying magnetic field, the Coriolis effect and the inertial frame dragging effect. Like STIRAP, those phenomena occur for counterintuitively ordered field pulses and are robustly insensitive to small changes in the interaction properties.",Human
"A detailed experimental study of antiphase dynamics in a two-mode semiconductor laser with optical injection is presented. The device is a specially designed Fabry-Perot laser that supports two primary modes with a THz frequency spacing. Injection in one of the primary modes of the device leads to a rich variety of single and two-mode dynamical scenarios, which are reproduced with remarkable accuracy by a four dimensional rate equation model. Numerical bifurcation analysis reveals the importance of torus bifurcations in mediating transitions to antiphase dynamics and of saddle-node of limit cycle bifurcations in switching of the dynamics between single and two-mode regimes.",Human
"Certain results of observational cosmology cast critical doubt on the foundations of standard cosmology but leave most cosmologists untroubled. Alternative cosmological models that differ from the Big Bang have been published and defended by heterodox scientists; however, most cosmologists do not heed these. This may be because standard theory is correct and all other ideas and criticisms are incorrect, but it is also to a great extent due to sociological phenomena such as the ""snowball effect"" or ""groupthink"". We might wonder whether cosmology, the study of the Universe as a whole, is a science like other branches of physics or just a dominant ideology.",Human
"We analyze the global temperature change due to the Mt. Pinatubo eruption using a simple two-layer model of the atmosphere and surface to obtain results consistent with satellite data. Through analytic and numerical analysis we find a principal characteristic response time of 5 to 8 months and a climate sensitivity of 0.17 to 0.20 C/(W/m^2), corresponding to a negative instantaneous feedback. Our solutions were fit to the data, reproducing the results of a one-box model, and providing somewhat more detailed information about the feedbacks related to surface layer temperature. The formalism for coupling of the surface layer to the thermocline is set up but not applied.",Human
"The GERDA experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta-decay of 76Ge and possibly for other rare processes. The sensitivity of the first phase is envisioned to be more than one order of magnitude better than in previous neutrinoless double beta-decay experiments. This implies that materials with ultra-low radioactive contamination need to be used for the construction of the detector and its shielding. Therefore the requirements on material screening include high-sensitivity low-background detection techniques and long measurement times. In this article, an overview of material-screening laboratories available to the GERDA collaboration is given, with emphasis on the gamma-spectrometry. Additionally, results of an intercomparison of the evaluation accuracy in these laboratories are presented.",Human
"We recently reported the formation of ultracold LiCs molecules in the rovibrational ground state X1Sigma+,v''=0,J''=0 [J. Deiglmayr et al., PRL 101, 133004 (2008)]. Here we discuss details of the experimental setup and present a thorough analysis of the photoassociation step including the photoassociation line shape. We predict the distribution of produced ground state molecules using accurate potential nergy curves combined with an ab-initio dipole transition moment and compare this prediction with experimental ionization spectra. Additionally we improve the value of the dissociation energy for the X1Sigma+ state by high resolution spectroscopy of the vibrational ground state.",Human
"We present a viewport for use in Ultra-high vacuum (UHV) based upon the preflattened solder seal design presented in earlier work, Cox et al. Rev. Sci. Inst. 74, 3185 (2003). The design features significant modifications to improve long term performance. The windows have been leak tested to less than 10^-10 atm cm^3/s . From atom number measurements in an optical dipole trap loaded from a vapor cell magneto-optical trap (MOT) inside a vacuum chamber accommodating these viewports, we measure a trap lifetime of 9.5s suggesting a pressure of around 10^-10 Torr limited by background Rubidium vapor pressure. We also present a simplified design where the UHV seal is made directly to a vacuum pipe",Human
"Scholars, advertisers and political activists see massive online social networks as a representation of social interactions that can be used to study the propagation of ideas, social bond dynamics and viral marketing, among others. But the linked structures of social networks do not reveal actual interactions among people. Scarcity of attention and the daily rythms of life and work makes people default to interacting with those few that matter and that reciprocate their attention. A study of social interactions within Twitter reveals that the driver of usage is a sparse and hidden network of connections underlying the declared set of friends and followers.",Human
"An octopus program is demonstrated to generate electron energy levels in three-dimensional geometrical potential wells. The wells are modeled to have shapes similar to cone, pyramid and truncated-pyramid. To simulate the electron energy levels in quantum mechanical scheme like the ones in parabolic band approximation scheme, the program is run initially to find a suitable electron mass fraction that can produce ground-state energies in the wells as close to those in quantum dots as possible and further to simulate excited-state energies. The programs also produce wavefunctions for exploring and determining their degeneracies and vibrational normal modes.",Human
"We investigate the evolutionary dynamics in directed and/or weighted networks. We study the fixation probability of a mutant in finite populations in stochastic voter-type dynamics for several update rules. The fixation probability is defined as the probability of a newly introduced mutant in a wild-type population taking over the entire population. In contrast to the case of undirected and unweighted networks, the fixation probability of a mutant in directed networks is characterized not only by the degree of the node that the mutant initially invades but by the global structure of networks. Consequently, the gross connectivity of networks such as small-world property or modularity has a major impact on the fixation probability.",Human
We have investigated how uncertainties in the estimation of the detection efficiency affect the 90% confidence intervals in the unified approach for constructing confidence intervals. The study has been conducted for experiments where the number of detected events is large and can be described by a Gaussian probability density function. We also assume the detection efficiency has a Gaussian probability density and study the range of the relative uncertainties $\sigma_\epsilon$ between 0 and 30%. We find that the confidence intervals provide proper coverage over a wide signal range and increase smoothly and continuously from the intervals that ignore scale uncertainties with a quadratic dependence on $\sigma_\epsilon$.,Human
"We discuss the use of a Langevin equation with a colored (correlated) noise to perform constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Since the equations of motion are linear in nature, it is easy to predict the response of a Hamiltonian system to such a thermostat and to tune at will the relaxation time of modes of different frequency. This allows one to optimize the time needed to thermalize the system and generate independent configurations. We show how this frequency-dependent response can be exploited to control the temperature of Car-Parrinello-like dynamics, keeping at low temperature the electronic degrees of freedom, without affecting the adiabatic separation from the vibrations of the ions.",Human
"Ultracold collisions of cold atoms or molecules make the bound states of the collision complex formed from the two colliding species accessible for control and manipulation of the cold species or the complex. Such resonances are best treated by a resonant scattering theory, which in the ultracold domain can take advantage of the properties of the long-range potential and the methods of multichannel quantum defect theory. Coupled channels calculations on the threshold scattering states and bound states of the 40K87Rb molecule illustrate the ideas and methodology of quantum defect theory using the long-range potential and also demonstrate the spin properties of the bound states throughout the spectrum.",Human
"In this note we present a mathematical framework for a rigorous approach to a common track fit for trackers located in the inner region of the ZEUS detector. The approach makes use of the Kalman filter and offers a rigorous treatment of magnetic field inhomogeneity, multiple scattering and energy loss. We describe mathematical details of the implementation of the Kalman filter technique with a reduced amount of computations for a cylindrical drift chamber, barrel and forward silicon strip detectors and a forward straw drift chamber. Options with homogeneous and inhomogeneous field are discussed. The fitting of tracks in one ZEUS event takes about of 20ms on standard PC.",Human
"We demonstrate that left-handed resonance transmission from metallic metamaterial, composed of periodically arranged double rings, can be extended to visible spectrum by introducing an active medium layer as the substrate. The severe ohmic loss inside metals at optical frequencies is compensated by stimulated emission of radiation in this active system. Due to the resonance amplification mechanism of recently proposed lasing spaser, the left-handed transmission band can be restored up to 610 nm wavelength, in dependence on the gain coefficient of the active layer. Additionally, threshold gains for different scaling levels of the double-ring unit are investigated to evaluate the gain requirement of left-handed transmission restoration at different frequency ranges.",Human
"We present two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for precision studies of atomic properties of excited states. The bi-colored technique addresses a narrow set of velocity groups of a thermal atomic vapour using a two-step transition to ""burn a hole"" in the velocity distribution. The resulting spectrum presents sub-Doppler linewidths, good signal to noise ratio and the trademark sidebands that work as an in situ ruler for the energy spacing between atomic resonances. The spectra obtained can be used for different applications such as measurements of energy splittings or stabilization of laser frequencies to excited atomic transitions.",Human
"We extend the active walker model to address the formation of paths on gradients, which have been observed to have a zigzag form. Our extension includes a new rule which prohibits direct descent or ascent on steep inclines, simulating aversion to falling. Further augmentation of the model stops walkers from changing direction very rapidly as that would likely lead to a fall. The extended model predicts paths with qualitatively similar forms to the observed trails, but only if the terms suppressing sudden direction changes are included. The need to include terms into the model that stop rapid direction change when simulating mountain trails indicates that a similar rule should also be included in the standard active walker model.",Human
"The electroweak theory contains too many empirical parameters. Most of them are related to the flavor part of particle physics. In this paper we discuss a relevant simple idea: the complicated system of actual dimensionless, small versus large, quantities in elementary particle flavor phenomenology is small deviated from an explicitly defined benchmark flavor pattern with no tuning parameters. One small empirical universal dimensionless parameter measures this deviation. Its possible physical connections are discussed. As inferences, quasi-degenerate neutrino type with mass scale m = 0.16-0.18 eV, neutrino and quark mixing matrices, large neutrino oscillation 3-flavor hierarchy and quark-neutrino complementarity are predicted.",Human
"We report on a series of experiments on the dynamics of spontaneous emission controlled nanolasers. The laser cavity is a photonic crystal slab cavity, embedding self-assembled quantum dots as gain material. The implementation of cavity electrodynamics effects increases significantly the large signal modulation bandwidth, with measured modulation speeds of the order of 10 GHz while keeping an extinction ratio of 19 dB. A linear transient wavelength shift is reported, corresponding to a chirp of less than 100 pm for a 35-ps laser pulse. We observe that the chirp characteristics are independent of the repetition rate of the laser up to 10 GHz.",Human
"Reduced equations that describe low-frequency plasma dynamics play an important role in our understanding of plasma behavior over long time scales. One of the oldest paradigms for reduced plasma dynamics involves the ponderomotive Hamiltonian formulation of the oscillation-center dynamics of charged particles (over slow space-time scales) in a weakly-nonuniform background plasma perturbed by an electromagnetic field with fast space-time scales. These reduced plasma equations are derived here by Lie-transform and variational methods for the case of a weakly-magnetized background plasma. In particular, both methods are used to derive explicit expressions for the ponderomotive polarization and magnetization, which appear in the oscillation-center Vlasov-Maxwell equations.",Human
"There is often a bond between two great men of a society at the time when one is at the peak of his life and the other at its beginning. The great Serbian 19th century poet, clergyman and educator father Vasa Zivkovic, interceding in favour of his student Mihajlo Pupin, significantly influenced the conditions necessary for Pupin`s development into the person he later became. Mihajlo Pupin was certainly not the only student to benefit from father Vasa Zivkovic advice and material support. However their relationship is a perfect example of an acclaimed person successfully influencing a person yet to win acclaim.",Human
"We propose a simple model of cytochrome c oxidase, including four redox centers and four protonable sites, to study the time evolution of electrostatically coupled electron and proton transfers initiated by the injection of a single electron into the enzyme. We derive a system of master equations for electron and proton state probabilities and show that an efficient pumping of protons across the membrane can be obtained for a reasonable set of parameters. All four experimentally observed kinetic phases appear naturally from our model. We also calculate the dependence of the pumping efficiency on the transmembrane voltage at different temperatures and discuss a possible mechanism of the redox-driven proton translocation.",Human
We study the force vs extension behaviour of a helical spring made of a thin torsionally-stiff anisotropic elastic rod. Our focus is on springs of very low helical pitch. For certain parameters of the problem such a spring is found not to unwind when pulled but rather to form hockles that pop-out one by one and lead to a highly non-monotonic force-extension curve. Between abrupt loop pop-outs this curve is well described by the planar elastica whose relevant solutions are classified. Our results may be relevant for tightly coiled nanosprings in future micro- and nano(electro)mechanical devices.,Human
"The propagation of pulses through waveguides with subwavelength features, inhomogeneous transverse structure, and high index contrast cannot be described accurately using existing models in the presence of nonlinear effects. Here we report the development of a generalised full vectorial model of nonlinear pulse propagation and demonstrate that, unlike the standard pulse propagation formulation, the z-component of guided modes plays a key role for these new structures, and results in generalised definitions of the nonlinear coefficient $\gamma,$ $A_{eff}$, and mode orthognality. While new definitions reduce to standard definitions in some limits, significant differences are predicted, including a factor of $\sim2$ higher value for $\gamma$, for emerging waveguides and microstructured fibers.",Human
"A simple way to define the flow rules of plasticity models is the assumption of generalized normality associated with a suitable pseudo-potential function. This approach, however, is not usually employed to formulate endochronic theory and non-linear kinematic (NLK) hardening rules as well as generalized plasticity models. In this paper, generalized normality is used to give a new formulation of these classes of models. As a result, a suited pseudo-potential is introduced for endochronic models and a non-standard description of NLK hardening and generalized plasticity models is also provided. This new formulation allows for an effective investigation of the relationships between these three classes of plasticity models.",Human
"We describe the combination of buffer-gas cooling with electrostatic velocity filtering to produce a high-flux continuous guided beam of internally cold and slow polar molecules. In a previous paper (L.D. van Buuren et al., arXiv:0806.2523v1) we presented results on density and state purity for guided beams of ammonia and formaldehyde using an optimized set-up. Here we describe in more detail the technical aspects of the cryogenic source, its operation, and the optimization experiments that we performed to obtain best performance. The versatility of the source is demonstrated by the production of guided beams of different molecular species.",Human
"The method of coordinate transformation offers a way to realize perfect cloaks, but provides less ability to characterize the performance of a multilayered cloak in practice. Here, we propose an analytical model to predict the performance of a multilayered cylindrical cloak, based on which, the cloak in practice can be optimized to diminish the intrinsic scatterings caused by discretization and simplification. Extremely low scattering or ""quasi-perfect invisibility"" can be achieved with only a few layers of anisotropic metamaterials without following the transformation method. Meanwhile, the permittivity and permeability parameters of the layers are relatively small, which is a remarkable advantage of our approach.",Human
"The quasiclassical correction to the Moliere's formula for multiple scattering is derived. The consideration is based on the scattering amplitude, obtained with the first quasiclassical correction taken into account for arbitrary localized but not spherically symmetric potential. Unlike the leading term, the correction to the Moliere's formula contains the target density $n$ and thickness $L$ not only in the combination $nL$ (areal density). Therefore, this correction can be reffered to as the bulk density correction. It turns out that the bulk density correction is small even for high density. This result explains the wide region of applicability of the Moliere's formula.",Human
"We study the direct and inverse scattering problems when the incident electromagnetic field is a time harmonic point- generated wave in a chiral medium and the scatterer is a perfectly conducting sphere. The exact Green s function and the electric far-field patterns of the scattering problem are constructed. For a small sphere, a closed-form approximation of the scattered wave field at the source of the incident spherical wave is obtained. These near-field results lead to the solution of an inverse problem. We also treat the same inverse problem using far-field results via the leading order term in the low-frequency asymptotic expansion of the scattering cross-section.",Human
"We present results on a free-space atom interferometer operating on the first order magnetically insensitive |F=1,mF=0> -> |F=2,mF=0> transition of Bose-condensed 87Rb atoms. A pulsed atom laser is output-coupled from a Bose-Einstein condensate and propagates through a sequence of two internal state beam splitters, realized via coherent Raman transitions between the two interfering states. We observe Ramsey fringes with a visibility close to 100% and determine the current and the potentially achievable interferometric phase sensitivity. This system is well suited to testing recent proposals for generating and detecting squeezed atomic states.",Human
"The continuous wavelet transform may be enhanced by deconvolution with the wavelet response function. After correcting for the cone-of-influence, the power spectral density of the solar magnetic record as given by the derectified yearly sunspot number is calculated, revealing a spectrum of odd harmonics of the fundamental Hale cycle, and the integrated instant power is compared to a reconstruction of global temperature in a normalized scatter plot displaying a positive correlation after the turn of the twentieth century. Comparison of the spectrum with that obtained from the Central England Temperature record suggests that some features are shared while others are not, and the scatter plot again indicates a possible correlation.",Human
"A dissipation rate, which grows faster than any power of the wave number in Fourier space, may be scaled to lead a hydrodynamic system {\it actually} or {\it potentially} converge to its Galerkin truncation. Actual convergence we name for the asymptotic truncation at a finite wavenumber $k_G$ above which modes have no dynamics; and, we define potential convergence for the truncation at $k_G$ which, however, grows without bound. Both types of convergence can be obtained with the dissipation rate $\mu[cosh(k/k_c)-1]$ who behaves as $k^2$ (newtonian) and $\exp\{k/k_c\}$ for small and large $k/k_c$ respectively. Competition physics of cascade, thermalization and dissipation are discussed with numerical Navier-Stokes turbulence, emphasizing on the intermittency growth.",Human
"It is found in the Pt/Co/Pt(111) sandwiches that perpendicular magnetic anisotropy weakens associated with the dramatic magnetization enhancement as the temperature decreases below a critical temperature, T_cri, which increases with the Pt overlayer thickness t_Pt. For the sandwich with enough thick Pt overlayer, it trends to an unusual state with weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the absence of obvious easy direction behavior at low temperature. It suggests that Pt is more significantly polarized in the film with thicker Pt overlayer. The results reveal the strong influence of both thick nonmagnetic coverage and temperature on the electronic structure of the Pt/Co/Pt(111) sandwich.",Human
"Paradoxes are a very frequent phenomenon in processes of thought which strive towards the intelectual and cognitive shifts. They occur in all areas of human spiritual activites. What we are interested here in, are the paradoxes in physics. We will try to give the answers to the questions such as: What are the reasons for developing the paradox in physics? Can a certain kind of classification of paradoxes in physics be nade and on what basis? What exactly is the paradox in phisics? What is the opinion of the physicists on paradox and what significance do they give to it?",Human
"Proceeding like Newton with a discrete time approach of motion and a geometrical representation of velocity and acceleration, we obtain Kepler's laws without solving differential equations. The difficult part of Newton's work, when it calls for non trivial properties of ellipses, is avoided by the introduction of polar coordinates. Then a simple reconsideration of Newton's figure naturally leads to en explicit expression of the velocity and to the equation of the trajectory. This derivation, which can be fully apprehended by beginners at university (or even before) can be considered as a first application of mechanical concepts to a physical problem of great historical and pedagogical interest.",Human
"In a previous work a procedure was decribed for dividing the $3 \times N$-dimensional conformational space of a molecular system into a number of discrete cells, this partition allowed the building of a combinatorial structure from data sampled in molecular dynamics trajectories: the graph of cells or G, encoding the set of cells in conformational space that are visited by the system in its thermal wandering. The information in G however, is encoded in a great number of fragments that must be aggregated. We describe here the algorithmic procedures 1) for aggregating the information from G into an hypergraph allowing to enumerate the relevant cells from conformational space, and 2) for puttting the data in a very compact format.",Human
"High fluxes of cold polar molecules are efficiently produced by electric guiding and velocity filtering. Here, we investigate different aspects of the beam formation. Variations of the source parameters such as density and temperature result in characteristic changes in the guided beam. These are observed in the velocity distribution of the guided molecules as well as in the dependence of the signal of guided molecules on the trapping electric field. A model taking into account velocity-dependent collisional losses of cold molecules in the region close to the nozzle accurately reproduces this behavior. This clarifies an open question on the parameter dependence of the detected signal and gives a more detailed understanding of the velocity filtering and guiding process.",Human
"We formulate a spectral graph-partitioning algorithm that uses the two leading eigenvectors of the matrix corresponding to a selected quality function to split a network into three communities in a single step. In so doing, we extend the recursive bipartitioning methods developed by Newman [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 103, 8577 (2006); Phys. Rev. E 74, 036104 (2006)] to allow one to consider the best available two-way and three-way divisions at each recursive step. We illustrate the method using simple ""bucket brigade"" examples and then apply the algorithm to examine the community structures of the coauthorship graph of network scientists and of U. S. Congressional networks inferred from roll-call voting similarities.",Human
"We describe the design, fabrication, and measurement of a cavity opto-mechanical system consisting of two nanobeams of silicon nitride in the near-field of each other, forming a so-called ""zipper"" cavity. A photonic crystal patterning is applied to the nanobeams to localize optical and mechanical energy to the same cubic-micron-scale volume. The picrogram-scale mass of the structure, along with the strong per-photon optical gradient force, results in a giant optical spring effect. In addition, a novel damping regime is explored in which the small heat capacity of the zipper cavity results in blue-detuned opto-mechanical damping.",Human
"A growing expertise to engineer, manipulate and probe different cold-atom analogs of electronic condensed matter systems allows to probe properties of exotic pairing. We study paired states of spin-imbalanced ultracold atomic system of fermions with attractive short-range interactions in one-dimensional traps. Calculations are done using the Bethe Ansatz technique and the trap is incorporated into the solution via a local density approximation. The thermodynamic-Bethe-Ansatz equations are solved numerically and different local density profiles are calculated for zero and finite temperatures. A procedure to identify the homogeneous-system phase diagram using local density profiles in the trap is also proposed. Such scheme would be immediately useful for the experiments.",Human
"Traditional methods of reporting changes in student responses have focused on class-wide averages. Such models hide information about the switches in responses by individual students over the course of a semester. We extend unpublished work by Steven Kanim on ""escalator diagrams"" which show changes in student responses from correct to incorrect (and vice versa) while representing pre- and post-instruction results on questions. Our extension consists of ""consistency plots"" in which we represent three forms of data: method of solution and correctness of solution both before and after instruction. Our data are from an intermediate mechanics class, and come from (nearly) identical midterm and final examination questions.",Human
"Aerodynamic models are developed to describe coherent structures and transport processes in hurricanes moving over open seas. The models consist of the lower boundary layer and upper adiabatic layer. Except friction at the air/sea interface,proposed modeling avoids the common turbulent approximations while using explicitly or implicitly basic stability constraints. The models analyze dynamics of upper hurricane adiabatic layer, dynamics and transport processes in hurricane boundary layer, and genesis and maturing of hurricane. The proposed modeling provides a rude enough but consistent analytical description of basic processes in hurricanes. The present paper qualitatively describes the model of mature hurricane, briefly discusses the basic thermodynamic relations and aerodynamic equations, and establishes the principles of horizontal motion for mature hurricane.",Human
"This second paper of the series (see the first one in [1]) models the dynamics and structure of upper hurricane layer in adiabatic approximation. Formulation of simplified aerodynamic model allows analytically express the radial istributions of pressure and wind speed components. The vertical evolution of these distributions and hurricane structure in the layer are described by a coupled set of equations for the vertical mass flux and vertical momentum balance, averaged over the eye wall cross section. Several realistic predictions of the model are demonstrated, including the change of directions for the component of radial wind speed and angular velocity of hurricane with altitude.",Human
"Valencia et al. recently claimed that the mass of a Super-Earth (SE) is a sole factor in determining whether a SE is tectonically active or not. However, mass resolving astrometry is unable to discern between a SE and its moons if any. The fact that no exomoons have been discovered yet is rather a matter of instrumentation imperfection at the present, not of physical absence of exomoons. This, with recently discovered relationships between geometric and physical properties in astronomical bodies (Transiting planets; the Earth) makes it impossible to know yet if the Wageners (here constraining) supposition on somehow-tidally caused tectonics holds universally or not also.",Human
"The effects of line-tying on resistive tearing instability in slab geometry is studied within the framework of reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD).\citep{KadomtsevP1974,Strauss1976} It is found that line-tying has a stabilizing effect. The tearing mode is stabilized when the system length $L$ is shorter than a critical length $L_{c}$, which is independent of the resistivity $\eta$. When $L$ is not too much longer than $L_{c}$, the growthrate $\gamma$ is proportional to $\eta$ . When $L$ is sufficiently long, the tearing mode scaling $\gamma\sim\eta^{3/5}$ is recovered. The transition from $\gamma\sim\eta$ to $\gamma\sim\eta^{3/5}$ occurs at a transition length $L_{t}\sim\eta^{-2/5}$.",Human
"Experiments for vacuum birefringence and vacuum dichroism have been set up with high-finesse high magnetic experimental apparatuses, which seem to be ideal for small gaseous Cotton-Mouton effect (CME) measurements.

In this Letter, we report on our measurement of CMEs in nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, and krypton at the same wavelength in a magnetic field B = 2.3 T at pressure P = 0.5-300 Torr and temperature T = 295-298 K.

An optical measurement of the 2S hyperfine interval in atomic hydrogen using two-photon spectroscopy of the 1S-2S transition gives a value of 177 556 834.3(6.7) Hz. The uncertainty is   2.4 times smaller than achieved by our group in 2003 and more than 4 times smaller than for any independent radio-frequency measurement. The specific combination of the 2S and 1S hyperfine intervals predicted by QED theory $D_{21}=8 f_{\rm HFS}({2S}) - f_{\rm HFS}({1S})=48 953(3)$ Hz is in good agreement with the value of 48 923(54) Hz obtained from this experiment.,Human
"In the context of our recently developed emergent quantum mechanics, and, in particular, based on an assumed sub-quantum thermodynamics, the necessity of energy quantization as originally postulated by Max Planck is explained by means of purely classical physics. Moreover, under the same premises, also the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator is derived. Essentially, Planck's constant h is shown to be indicative of a particle's ""zitterbewegung"" and thus of a fundamental angular momentum. The latter is identified with quantum mechanical spin, a residue of which is thus present even in the non-relativistic Schroedinger theory.",Human
"We study energy propagation in locally time-periodically driven disordered nonlinear chains. For frequencies inside the band of linear Anderson modes, three different regimes are observed with increasing driver amplitude: 1) Below threshold, localized quasiperiodic oscillations and no spreading; 2) Three different regimes in time close to threshold, with almost regular oscillations initially, weak chaos and slow spreading for intermediate times, and finally strong diffusion; 3) Immediate spreading for strong driving. The thresholds are due to simple bifurcations, obtained analytically for a single oscillator, and numerically as turning-points of the nonlinear response manifold for a full chain. Generically, the threshold is nonzero also for infinite chains.",Human
"We have measured the spin-forbidden decay rate from (3s3d)$^{1}$D$_{2}$ $\to$ (3s3p)$^{3}$P$_{2,1}$ in $^{24}$Mg atoms trapped in a magneto-optical trap. The total decay rate, summing up both exit channels (3s3p)$^{3}$P$_{1}$ and (3s3p)$^{3}$P$_{2}$, yields (196 $\pm$ 10) s$^{-1}$ in excellent agreement with resent relativistic many-body calculations of [S.G. Porsev et al., Phys. Rev. A. \textbf{64}, 012508 (2001)]. The characterization of this decay channel is important as it may limit the performance of quantum optics experiments carried out with this ladder system as well as two-photon cooling experiments currently explored in several groups.",Human
"In non-ideal plasmas, the dielectric function has to be treated beyond the random phase approximation. Correlations and well as collisions have to be included. These corrections are known as (dynamical) local field corrections. With the help of the Zubarev approach to linear response theory, a relaxation time approximation is proposed leading to an interpolation scheme between static local field corrections and the Drude model in the long wave length limit. The approach generalizes the Mermin approximation for the dielectric function and allows for the inclusion of a dynamical collision frequency. Exploratory calculations for a classical two-component plasma at intermediate coupling are presented.",Human
"We present quantum dynamics of collisions between two para-H2 molecules from low (1 mK) to high collision energies (1 eV). The calculations are carried out using a quantum scattering code that solves the time-independent Schrodinger equation in its full dimensionality without any decoupling approximations. The six-dimensional potential energy surface for the H4 system developed by Boothroyd et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 666 (2002)] is used in the calculations. Elastic, inelastic and state-to-state cross sections as well as rate coefficients from T = 1 K to 400 K obtained from our calculations are compared with available experimental and theoretical results. Overall, good agreement is obtained with previous studies.",Human
"Transverse beam stability is strongly affected by the beam space charge. Usually it is analyzed with the rigid-beam model. However this model is only valid when a bare (not affected by the space charge) tune spread is small compared to the space charge tune shift. This condition specifies a relatively small area of parameters which, however, is the most interesting for practical applications. The Landau damping rate and the beam Schottky spectra are computed assuming that validity condition is satisfied. The results are applied to a round Gaussian beam. The stability thresholds are described by simple fits for the cases of chromatic and octupole tune spreads.",Human
"The analysis of the ultrasonic frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient of aggregating red blood cells reveals information about blood structural properties. The difficulty to apply this technique in vivo is due to the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by intervening tissue layers that distorts the spectral content of backscattering properties from blood microstructures. An optimization method is proposed to simultaneously estimate tissue attenuation and blood structure factor. In an in vitro experiment, the method gave satisfactory estimates with relative errors below 22% for attenuations between 0.101 and 0.317 dB/cm/MHz, signal-to-noise ratios>28 dB and kR<2.7 (k being the wave number and R the aggregate radius).",Human
"Existing optical lattice clocks demonstrate a high level of performance, but they remain complex experimental devices. In order to address a wider range of applications including those requiring transportable devices, it will be necessary to simplify the laser systems and reduce the amount of support hardware. Here we demonstrate two significant steps towards this goal: demonstration of clock signals from a Sr lattice clock based solely on semiconductor laser technology, and a method for finding the clock transition (based on a coincidence in atomic wavelengths) that removes the need for extensive frequency metrology hardware. Moreover, the unexpected high contrast in the signal revealed evidence of density dependent collisions in Sr-88 atoms.",Human
"We have investigated the collisional properties of 41K atoms at ultracold temperature. To show the possibility to use 41K as a coolant, a Bose-Einstein condensate of 41K atoms in the stretched state (F=2, m_F=2) was created for the first time by direct evaporation in a magnetic trap. An upper bound of three body loss coefficient for atoms in the condensate was determined to be 4(2) 10^{-29} cm -6 s-1. A Feshbach resonance in the F=1, m_F=-1 state was observed at 51.42(5) G, which is in good agreement with theoretical prediction.",Human
"We develop a theoretical model to describe the radio-frequency (rf) induced coupling of a pair of colliding atoms to a Feshbach molecule when a magnetic field arbitrarily far from the Feshbach resonance is modulated in time. We use the dressed atom picture, and show that the coupling strength in presence of rf is equal to the Feshbach coupling strength multiplied by the square of a Bessel function. The argument of this function is equal to the ratio of the atomic rf Rabi frequency to the rf frequency. We experimentally demonstrate this law by measuring the rate of rf-association of molecules using a Feshbach resonance in d-wave collisions between ultra-cold chromium atoms.",Human
"We propose a new class of photonic devices based on periodic stress fields in silicon that enable second-order nonlinearity as well as quasi-phase matching. Periodically-poled silicon (PePSi) adds the periodic poling capability to silicon photonics, and allows the excellent crystal quality and advanced manufacturing capabilities of silicon to be harnessed for devices based on second-order nonlinear effects. As an example of the utility of the PePSi technology, we present simulations showing that mid-wave infrared radiation can be efficiently generated through difference frequency generation from near-infrared with a conversion efficiency of 50%. This technology can also be implemented with piezoelectric material, which offers the capability to dynamically control the X(2) nonlinearity.",Human
"We re-calculate electron yields and stopping power of protons colliding with surfaces of NaCl-type insulators. In this article, the projectile is considered to move taking into account the static and polarization potentials with all the individual ions forming the surface lattice unlike our previous work (Phys. Rev. A 75, 042904 (2007)) where the projectile was considered to move in an homogeneous planar potential. Substantial differences (up to forty percent of increment) have been found especially when the projectile incident angle approaches the critical one. We compare our prediction for electron yield and stopping power with the available experimental data for LiF, KI and KCl.",Human
"This article discusses the advantages of using wireless keypads in the Lecture/classroom. This new technology requires multiple-choice (MC) questions to mate with the keypad entry features of these devices. The format of the traditional MC response is constrained to five choices and only one best response is allowed. For this reason, we propose enhancements to the traditional MC question. This enhanced MC question allows as many as ten answers. The answers can vary in their degree of correctness and can be assigned partial credit. By combining wireless keypads and multiple-choice questions, we can readily perform both formative and summative assessments of student learning. Examples and classroom applications are presented.",Human
"We present and analyze the simple analytically solvable model of 1/f noise, which can be relevant for the understanding of the origin, main properties and parameter dependencies of the flicker noise. In the model, the currents or signals represented as sequences of the random pulses, which recurrence time intervals between transit times of pulses are uncorrelated with the shape of the pulse, are analyzed. It is shown that for the pulses of fixed area with random duration, distributed uniformly in a wide interval, 1/f behavior of the power spectrum of the signal or current in wide range of frequency may be obtained.",Human
"We study the statistical properties of return intervals $r$ between successive energy dissipation rates above a certain threshold $Q$ in three-dimensional fully developed turbulence. We find that the distribution function $P_Q(r)$ scales with the mean return interval $R_Q$ as $P_Q(r)=R_Q^{-1}f(r/R_Q)$ except for $r=1$, where the scaling function $f(x)$ has two power-law regimes. The return intervals are short-term and long-term correlated and possess multifractal nature. The Hurst index of the return intervals decays exponentially against $R_Q$, predicting that rare extreme events with $R_Q\to\infty$ are also long-term correlated with the Hurst index $H_\infty=0.639$.",Human
"A cylindrical flexible cable made up of pure fluid water can be experimentally spanned across a spatial gap with cable endpoints fixed to the top edges of two glass beakers. The cable has been called a water bridge in close analogy to iron cables employed to build ordinary span bridges. A necessary condition for the construction of a water bridge is that a large electric field exists parallel to and located within the water cable. Presently, there is no accepted detailed theory which quantitatively explains the forces which hold up the bridge. Our purpose is to present such theory based on the Maxwell pressure tensor induced by the electric field albeit within the condensed matter dielectric fluid cable.",Human
"An attempt to redefine science in the 21st century (BK Jennings, On the Nature of Science, Physics in Canada, 63(7) 2007) has abandoned traditional notions of natural law and objective reality, blurred the distinctions between natural science and natural history, elevated Occam's razor from an epistemological preference to a scientific principle, and elevated peer-review and experimental care as equals with repeatable experiment as arbiters of scientific validity. Our comments review the long-established axioms of the scientific method, remind readers of the distinctions between science and history, disprove the generality of Occam's razor by counter example, and highlight the risks of accepting additional scientific arbiters as equal to repeatable experiment.",Human
"We investigate the feasibility of high performance scientific computation using cloud computers as an alternative to traditional computational tools. The availability of these large, virtualized pools of compute resources raises the possibility of a new compute paradigm for scientific research with many advantages. For research groups, cloud computing provides convenient access to reliable, high performance clusters and storage, without the need to purchase and maintain sophisticated hardware. For developers, virtualization allows scientific codes to be optimized and pre-installed on machine images, facilitating control over the computational environment. Preliminary tests are presented for serial and parallelized versions of the widely used x-ray spectroscopy and electronic structure code FEFF on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, including CPU and network performance.",Human
"We present a basic tutorial for implementing surface mount technology in lab-built scientific instruments. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using surface mount chips. We also describe methods for the development and prototyping of surface mount circuitry in home-built electronics. The method of soldering surface mount components in a common toaster oven is described. We provide advice from our own experience in developing this technology, and argue that surface mount technology is often preferable to using leaded components when building large circuits, and is essential if the desired component characteristics are only available in surface mount packages.",Human
"A theoretical model for laser cooled continuous-wave fiber amplifier is presented. The amplification process takes place in the Tm3+-doped core of the fluoride ZBLAN (ZrF4-BaF2-LaF3-AlF3-NaF) glass fiber. The cooling process takes place in the Yb3+:ZBLAN fiber cladding. It is shown that for each value of the pump power and the amplified signal there is a distribution of the concentration of the Tm3+ along the length of the fiber amplifier, which provides its athermal operation. The influence of a small deviation in the value of the amplified signal on the temperature of the fiber with the fixed distribution of the Tm3+ions in the fiber cladding is investigated.",Human
Terahertz time domain spectroscopy and rigorous simulations are used to probe the coupling between a dark and a bright plasmonic eigenmode in a metamaterial with broken symmetry. The metamaterial consists of two closely spaced split ring resonators that have their gaps in non-identical positions within the ring. For normal incidence and a fixed polarization both lowest order eigenmodes of the split ring resonators can be excited; although one of them has to be regarded as dark since coupling is prohibited because of symmetry constraints. Emphasis in this work is put on a systematic evaluation of the coupling effects depending on a spectral tuning of both resonances.,Human
"Porphyrin nanotubes (PNTs) are prepared by self-assembly using meso-tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin and Fe(III) meso-Tetra (N-Methyl-4-Pyridyl) porphyrin in water as starting materials. Long tubes of about one micron diameter are formed with bunches of smaller tubes attached to it, as judged from the analysis of HRTEM images. The PNTs formed by this method are found to exhibit good visible emission at 669 nm on excitation at 432 nm whereas both parent porphyrin monomers do not exhibit any fluorescence. This result highlights the scope of PNTs as functional components in the design of biofriendly devices in medical as well as nanophotonics applications.",Human
"Econophysics, is based on the premise that some ideas and methods from physics can be applied to economic situations. We intend to show in this paper how a physics concept such as entropy can be applied to an economic problem. In so doing, we demonstrate how information in the form of observable data and moment constraints are introduced into the method of Maximum relative Entropy (MrE). A general example of updating with data and moments is shown. Two specific econometric examples are solved in detail which can then be used as templates for real world problems. A numerical example is compared to a large deviation solution which illustrates some of the advantages of the MrE method.",Human
"The boundary element method is applied to investigate the optical forces when whispering gallery modes (WGMs) are excited by a total internally reflected wave. Such evanescent wave is particularly effective in exciting the high-$Q$ WGM, while the low angular or high radial order modes are suppressed relatively. This results in a large contrast between the forces on and off resonance, and thus allows for high size-selectivity. We fully incorporate the prism-particle interaction and found that the optical force behaves differently at different separations. Optimal separation is found which corresponds to a compromise between intensity and $Q$ factor.",Human
"The Navier-Stokes-Voigt (NSV) model of viscoelastic incompressible fluid has been recently proposed as a regularization of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for the purpose of direct numerical simulations. In this work we investigate its statistical properties by employing phenomenological heuristic arguments, in combination with Sabra shell model simulations of the analogue of the NSV model. For large values of the regularizing parameter, compared to the Kolmogorov length scale, simulations exhibit multiscaling inertial range, and the dissipation range displaying low intermittency. These facts provide evidence that the NSV regularization may reduce the stiffness of direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows, with a small impact on the energy containing scales.",Human
"A physically consistent approach is considered for defining an external magnetic field as needed in computational fluid dynamics problems involving magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The approach results in simple analytical formulae that can be used in numerical studies where an inhomogeneous magnetic field influences a liquid metal flow. The resulting magnetic field is divergence and curl-free, and contains two components and parameters to vary. As an illustration, the following examples are considered: peakwise, stepwise, shelfwise inhomogeneous magnetic fields, and the field induced by a solenoid. Finally, the impact of the streamwise magnetic field component is shown qualitatively to be significant for rapidly changing fields.",Human
The silicon trackers of the ATLAS experiment at LHC (CERN) use optical links for data transmission. VCSEL arrays operating at 850 nm are used to transmit optical signals while PIN arrays are used to convert the optical signals into electrical signals. We investigate the feasibility of using the devices at the Super LHC (SLHC). We irradiated VCSEL and GaAs PIN arrays from three vendors and silicon PIN arrays from one vendor. All arrays can be operated up to the SLHC dosage except the GaAs PIN arrays which have very low responsivities after irradiation and hence are probably not suitable for the SLHC application.,Human
"The authors present a new molecular dynamics algorithm for sampling the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. In this approach the velocities of all particles and volume degrees of freedom are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The technical aspects concerning the derivation of the integration scheme and the conservation laws are discussed in detail. The efficiency of the barostat is examined in Lennard-Jones solid and liquid near the triple point and compared with the deterministic Nos\'{e}-Hoover and the stochastic Langevin methods. In particular, the dependence of the sampling efficiency on the choice of the thermostat and barostat relaxation times is systematically analyzed.",Human
"Unstable modes growing when two plasma shells cross over a background plasma at arbitrary angle $\theta$, are investigated using a non-relativistic three cold fluids model. Parallel flows with $\theta=0$ are slightly more unstable than anti-parallel ones with $\theta=\pi$. The case $\theta=\pi/2$ is as unstable as the $\theta=0$ one, but the fastest growing modes are oblique. While the most unstable wave vector varies with orientation, its growth rate slightly evolves and there is no such thing as a stable configuration. A number of exact results can be derived, especially for the $\theta=\pi/2$ case.",Human
"The geo and solar magnetic fields have long been thought to be very different objects both in terms of spatial structure and temporal behavior. The recently discovered field structure of a fully convective star is more reminiscent of planetary magnetic fields than the Sun's magnetic field (Donati J.-F. et al., Science, 311 (2006) 633), despite the fact that the physical and chemical properties of these objects clearly differ. This observation suggests that a simple controlling parameter could be responsible for these different behaviors. We report here the results of three-dimensional simulations which show that varying the aspect ratio of the active dynamo region can yield sharp transition from Earth-like steady dynamos to Sun-like dynamo waves.",Human
"Congestion in transport networks is a topic of theoretical interest and practical importance. In this paper we study the flow of vehicles in urban street networks. In particular, we use a cellular automata model to simulate the motion of vehicles along streets, coupled with a congestion-aware routing at street crossings. Such routing makes use of the knowledge of agents about traffic in nearby roads and allows the vehicles to dynamically update the routes towards their destinations. By implementing the model in real urban street patterns of various cities, we show that it is possible to achieve a global traffic optimization based on local agent decisions.",Human
"We investigate the performance of superconducting nanowire photon detectors fabricated from ultra-thin Nb. A direct comparison is made between these detectors and similar nanowire detectors fabricated from NbN. We find that Nb detectors are significantly more susceptible than NbN to thermal instability (latching) at high bias. We show that the devices can be stabilized by reducing the input resistance of the readout. Nb detectors optimized in this way are shown to have approximately 2/3 the reset time of similar large-active-area NbN detectors of the same geometry, with approximately 6% detection efficiency for single photons at 470 nm.",Human
"A self-focusing of a coasting relativistic beam in a plasma channel that is confined by an external magnetic field is studied as a means of reconditioning the beam emerging from a beam injector [a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ)] for a linac. A detailed study of the beam stability in the self-focused beam has been carried out. In order to explain beam filaments and the resistive hose instability in a unified way, we treat all the azimuthal modes in the derivation of the dispersion relation in a finite plasma channel that exhibit many unstable modes, which are classified by Weinberg's scheme [Steven Weinberg, J. Math. 8, 614 (1967)].",Human
"We summarize the R&D activities on a novel semitransparent microstrip sensor to be used on laser-based alignment systems for silicon trackers. The new sensor is used both for particle tracking and laser detection. The aim of this research line is to increase the optical transmittance (T) of Silicon microstrips detectors to infrared light, introducing minor modifications to the sensor design still suitable for its industrial production. The optical simulations used in the sensor design have been experimentally validated against several patterned material samples. This activities have been carried out in the context of SiLC collaboration for the next International Linear Collider.",Human
"The credit crisis roiling the world's financial markets will likely take years and entire careers to fully understand and analyze. A short empirical investigation of the current trends, however, demonstrates that the losses in certain markets, in this case the US equity markets, follow a cascade or epidemic flow like model along the correlations of various stocks. This phenomenon will be shown by the graphical display of stock returns across the network as well as the dependence of stock returns on topological measures. Finally, whether the idea of ""epidemic"" or a ""cascade"" is a metaphor or model for this crisis will be discussed.",Human
"Modular structure is ubiquitous among real-world networks from related proteins to social groups. Here we analyze the modular organization of brain networks at a large-scale (voxel level) extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. By using a random walk-based method, we unveil the modularity of brain-webs, and show that modules with a spatial distribution that matches anatomical structures with functional significance. The functional role of each node in the network is studied by analyzing its patterns of inter- and intra-modular connections. Results suggest that the modular architecture constitutes the structural basis for the coexistence of functional integration of distant and specialized brain areas during normal brain activities at rest.",Human
"By using the Renyi entropy, and following the same scheme that in the Fisher-Renyi entropy product case, a generalized statistical complexity is defined. Several properties of it, including inequalities and lower and upper bounds are derived. The hydrogen atom is used as a test system where to quantify these two different statistical magnitudes, the Fisher-Renyi entropy product and the generalized statistical complexity. For each level of energy, both indicators take their minimum values on the orbitals that correspond to the highest orbital angular momentum. Hence, in the same way as happens with the Fisher-Shannon and the statistical complexity, these generalized Renyi-like statistical magnitudes break the energy degeneration in the H-atom.",Human
"We report the observation of cold Cs Rydberg atom molecules bound at internuclear separations of R~3-9 um. The bound states result from avoided crossings between Rydberg atom pair interaction potentials in an applied electric field. The molecular states can be modified by changing the applied electric field. The molecules are observed by mapping the radial separation of the two Rydberg atoms as a function of time delay between excitation and detection using the Coulomb repulsion of the ions after pulsed field ionization. Measurements were performed for 63D+65D, 64D+66D, 65D+67D, and 66D+68D pairs. The experiment is in good agreement with calculations of the pair interactions for these states.",Human
"We have designed and demonstrated a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) array linearized with cryogenic feedback. To achieve the necessary loop gain a 300 element series array SQUID is constructed from three monolithic 100-element series arrays. A feedback resistor completes the loop from the SQUID output to the input coil. The short feedback path of this Linearized SQUID Array (LISA) allows for a substantially larger flux-locked loop bandwidth as compared to a SQUID flux-locked loop that includes a room temperature amplifier. The bandwidth, linearity, noise performance, and dynamic range of the LISA are sufficient for its use in our target application: the multiplexed readout of transition-edge sensor bolometers.",Human
"Lattice kinetic equations incorporating the effects of external/internal force fields via a shift of the local fields in the local equilibria, are placed within the framework of continuum kinetic theory. The mathematical treatment reveals that, in order to be consistent with the correct thermo-hydrodynamical description, temperature must also be shifted, besides momentum. New perspectives for the formulation of thermo-hydrodynamic lattice kinetic models of non-ideal fluids are then envisaged. It is also shown that on the lattice, the definition of the macroscopic temperature requires the inclusion of new terms directly related to discrete effects. The theoretical treatment is tested against a controlled case with a non ideal equation of state.",Human
"All the relativistic cosmological models of the universe, except Einstein's static model, imply that the 3-space of the spacetime of the universe is also expanding apart from the matter and the radiation in it. However, there is no observational evidence of the expansion of the 3-space of the spacetime of the universe. Actually, the 3-space of the spacetime of the universe might not be expanding at all. Consequently, the conceptual foundation of the relativistic cosmological models of the universe based on the general theory of relativity, which in turn is based on Riemannian geometry, might be faulty and misleading.",Human
"A plasma focus device capable of operating at 0.2 pulses per second during several minutes is used as a source of hard x-rays and fast neutrons. An experimental demonstration of the use of the neutrons emissions for radiation probing of hydrogenated substances is presented, showing a particular application in detecting water concentrations differences in the proximity of the device by elastic scattering. Moreover, the device produces ultrashort hard x-rays pulses useful for introspective images of small objects, static or in fast motion, suitable for the identification of internal submillimetric defects. Clear images of metallic objects shielded by several millimeters iron walls are shown.",Human
"Weakly-rotating turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection was studied experimentally and numerically. With increasing rotation and large enough Rayleigh number an abrupt transition from a turbulent state with nearly rotation-independent heat transport to another turbulent state with enhanced heat transfer is observed at a critical inverse Rossby number $1/Ro_c \simeq 0.4$. Whereas for $1/Ro < 1/Ro_c$ the strength of the large-scale convection-roll is either enhanced or essentially unmodified depending on parameters, its strength is increasingly diminished beyond $1/Ro_c$ where it competes with Ekman vortices that cause vertical fluid transport and thus heat-transfer enhancement.",Human
"During the past years the understanding of the multi-scale interaction problems have increased significantly. However, at present there exists a range of different analytical models for investigating multi-scale interactions and hardly any specific comparisons have been performed among these models. In this work, two different models for the generation of zonal flows from ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) background turbulence are discussed and compared. The methods used is the coherent mode coupling model and the wave kinetic equation model (WKE). It is shown that the two models give qualitatively the same results even though the assumption on the spectral difference is used in the (WKE) approach.",Human
"We study the behavior of self-propelled nano- and micro-rods in three dimensions, confined between two parallel walls, by simulations and scaling arguments. Our simulations include thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions, which are both relevant for the dynamical behavior at nano- to micrometer length scales. In order to investigate the importance hydrodynamic interactions, we also perform Brownian-dynamics-like simulations. In both cases, we find that self-propelled rods display a strong surface excess in confined geometries. An analogy with semi-flexible polymers is employed to derive scaling laws for the dependence on the wall distance, the rod length, and the propulsive force. The simulation data confirm the scaling predictions.",Human
"We present an {\it ab initio} and non-perturbative time-dependent approach to the problem of double ionization of a general atom driven by intense XUV laser pulses. After using a highly flexible $B$-Spline $R$-matrix method to generate field-free Hamiltonian and electric dipole matrices, the initial state is propagated in time using an efficient Arnoldi-Lanczos scheme. Test calculations for double ionization of He by a single laser pulse yield good agreement with benchmark results obtained with other methods. The method is then applied to two-color pump-probe processes, for which momentum and energy distributions of the two outgoing electrons are presented.",Human
"We explore the potential energy surfaces for NH molecules interacting with alkali-metal and alkaline-earth atoms using highly correlated ab-initio electronic structure calculations. The surfaces for interaction with alkali-metal atoms have deep wells dominated by covalent forces. The resulting strong anisotropies will produce strongly inelastic collisions. The surfaces for interaction with alkaline-earth atoms have shallower wells that are dominated by induction and dispersion forces. For Be and Mg the anisotropy is small compared to the rotational constant of NH, so that collisions will be relatively weakly inelastic. Be and Mg are thus promising coolants for sympathetic cooling of NH to the ultracold regime.",Human
"The generalized Einstein action is treated quantum mechanically by using a quadratic lagrangian form. The canonical quantization of this action is obtained by using the auxiliary variable to define the generalized momentum. Physical constraints are imposed on the surface term, which is defined to be the cosmological constant. One obtains the familiar Wheeler-de Witt equation. The solution of this equation is in conformity with General Relativity (GR) .In addition to the fact that it is free from GR setbacks at the early universe, since it gives time decaying cosmological constant. The wave function of the universe and the cosmic scale factor are complex quantities, which indicates the existance of quantum effects.2.7k, CBR temperature is calculated.",Human
"We investigate electron-positron pair production from vacuum for short laser pulses with sub-cycle structure, in the nonperturbative regime (Schwinger pair production). We use the non-equilibrium quantum kinetic approach, and show that the momentum spectrum of the created electron-positron pairs is extremely sensitive to the sub-cycle dynamics -- depending on the laser frequency $\omega$, the pulse length $\tau$, and the carrier phase $\phi$ -- and shows several distinctive new signatures. This observation could help not only in the design of laser pulses to optimize the experimental signature of Schwinger pair production, but also ultimately lead to new probes of light pulses at extremely short time scales.",Human
"New method of shaping quantum ""particle - unparticle"" vacuum excitations has been proposed in the framework of unification of relativity and quantum theory. Such unification is based solely on the notion of generalized coherent state (GCS) of N-level system and the geometry of unitary group SU(N) acting in state space $C^N$. Initially, neither contradictable notion of quantum particle, nor space-time coordinates (that cannot be a priori attached to nothing) are used in this construction. Quantum measurement of local dynamical variables (LDV) leads to the emergence of 4D dynamical space-time (DST). Morphogenesis of the ""field shell"" of GCS and its dynamics have been studied for N=2 in DST.",Human
"In this paper, we study the effects of introducing contrarians in a model of Opinion Dynamics where the agents have internal continuous opinions, but exchange information only about a binary choice that is a function of their continuous opinion, the CODA model. We observe that the hung election scenario still exists here, but it is weaker and it shouldn't be expected in every election. Finally, we also show that the introduction of contrarians make the tendency towards extremism of the original model weaker, indicating that the existence of agents that prefer to disagree might be an important aspect and help society to diminish extremist opinions.",Human
"A caesium fountain clock is operated utilizing a microwave oscillator that derives its frequency stability from a stable laser by means of a fiber-laser femtosecond frequency comb. This oscillator is based on the technology developed for optical clocks and replaces the quartz based microwave oscillator commonly used in fountain clocks. As a result, a significant decrease of the frequency instability of the fountain clock is obtained, reaching 0.74E-14 at 100 s averaging time. We could demonstrate that for a significant range of detected atom numbers the instability is limited by quantum projection noise only, and that for the current status of this fountain clock the new microwave source poses no limit on the achievable frequency instability.",Human
"A purely electrical sensing scheme is presented that determines the concentration of macromolecules in solution by measuring the capacitance between planar microelectrodes. Concentrations of DNA in the ng/mL range have been used in samples of 1 microL volume. The method has been applied to the characterisation of the dielectrophoretic response of DNA without the need for any chemical modifications. The influence of electrical parameters like duty cycle, voltage and frequency has been investigated. The results are in good agreement with data from dielectrophoretic studies on fluorescently labelled DNA. Extension of the method down to the single molecule level appears feasible.",Human
"We demonstrate a technique to lock the frequency of a laser to a transition between two excited states in Rb vapor in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We use a ladder configuration from specific hyperfine sublevels of the 5S 1/2, 5P 3/2, and 5D 5/2 levels. This atomic configuration can show Electromagnetically Induced Transparency and Absorption processes. The error signal comes from the difference in the transparency or absorption felt by the two orthogonal polarizations of the probe beam. A simplified model is in good quantitative agreement with the observed signals for the experimental parameters. We have used this technique to lock the frequency of the laser up to 1.5 GHz off atomic resonance.",Human
"Generalizing results of our previous work (where classical kinetic energy has been used) in this work (where ultra-relativistic kinetic energy is used) we suggest an original variant of the determination of minimal length (corresponding to Plank length) by formation of a microscopic (tiny) black hole. Like to some previous authors we use Heisenberg coordinate-momentum uncertainty relation, on the one hand. But, instead of metric fluctuation (obtained by second derivative in Einstein equations) that generalizes uncertainty relation by an additional term, used by previous authors, we use Hawking temperature of the black hole and standard Heisenberg coordinate-momentum uncertainty relation.",Human
"Based on the experimental data and estimations of the charged leptons and quarks masses, a close power law with exponent 3/4 has been found, connecting charged leptons masses and up quarks masses. A similar mass relation has been suggested for the masses of neutral leptons and down quarks. The latter mass relation and the results of the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments have been used for prediction of neutrino masses. The obtained masses of electron neutrino, muon neutrino and tau neutrino are 0.0003 eV, 0.003 eV and 0.04 eV, respectively. These values are compatible with the recent experimental data and support the normal hierarchy of neutrino masses.",Human
"The goal of this paper is to explore the possibility to detect and identify bacteria by sensing their odor via fluctuation-enhanced sensing with commercial Taguchi sensors. The fluctuations of the electrical resistance during exposure to different bacterial odors, Escherichia coli and anthrax-surrogate Bacillus subtilis, have been measured and analyzed. In the present study, the simplest method, the measurement and analysis of power density spectra was used. The sensors were run in the normal heated and the sampling-and-hold working modes, respectively. The results indicate that Taguchi sensors used in these fluctuation-enhanced modes are effective tools of bacterium detection and identification even when they are utilizing only the power density spectrum of the stochastic sensor signal.",Human
"We employ the velocity map imaging technique to measure kinetic energy and angular distributions of state selected CH3 (v2=0,1,2,3) and Br (2P3/2,2P1/2) photofragments produced by methyl bromide photolysis at 215.9 nm. These results show unambiguously that the Br and Br* forming channels result in different vibrational excitation of the umbrella mode of the methyl fragment. Low energy structured features appear on the images which arise from CH3Br+ photodissociation near 330 nm. The excess energy of the probe laser photon is channeled into CH3+ vibrational excitation, most probably in the nu_4 degenerate bend",Human
"We have recently started to investigate 2D arrays of confocal lens pairs. Miniaturization of the lens pairs can make the array behave ray-optically like a homogeneous medium. Here we generalize the geometry of the lens pairs. These generalisations include a sideways shift of the lens centres and a change in the orientation of both lenses in each pair. We investigate the basic ray optics of the resulting arrays, and illustrate these with movies rendered using ray-tracing software. We suggest that confocal lenslet arrays could be used to realize ray-optically some recent metamaterials concepts such as the coordinate-transform design paradigm.",Human
"`Zero-spin-photon hypothesis' as proposed in an earlier paper [1] states that: `due to inevitable consequence of the second-law of thermodynamics and spin-conservation, the `zero-spin-photon' is generated in pair-production process (of elementary particles), which decays into neutrino and antineutrino'. The zero-spin photon hypothesis explains [1] several riddles of physics and universe. In the present paper, it is shown that `the zero-spin photon hypothesis' when incorporated into the higer-order Feynman diagram (with a closed-loop) could possibly solve the half-a-century-old and famous `infinity-problem' of QED, and thus could avoid the need of the so called `re-normalization' procedure.",Human
"Quantum optics with quantum gases represents a new field, where the quantum nature of both light and ultracold matter plays equally important role. Only very recently this ultimate quantum limit of light-matter interaction became feasible experimentally. In traditional quantum optics, the cold atoms are considered classically, whereas, in quantum atom optics, the light is used as an essentially classical axillary tool. On the one hand, the quantization of optical trapping potentials can significantly modify many-body dynamics of atoms, which is well-known only for classical potentials. On the other hand, atomic fluctuations can modify the properties of the scattered light.",Human
"We propose a plasma experiment to be used to investigate fundamental properties of astrophysical dynamos. The highly conducting, fast-flowing plasma will allow experimenters to explore systems with magnetic Reynolds numbers an order of magnitude larger than those accessible with liquid-metal experiments. The plasma is confined using a ring-cusp strategy and subject to a toroidal differentially rotating outer boundary condition. As proof of principle, we present magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the proposed experiment. When a von K\'arm\'an-type boundary condition is specified, and the magnetic Reynolds number is large enough, dynamo action is observed. At different values of the magnetic Prandtl and Reynolds numbers the simulations demonstrate either laminar or turbulent dynamo action.",Human
"The problem of the universal form of the size spectrum is analyzed. The half-widths of two wings of spectrum is introduced and it is shown that their ratio is very close to the golden fraction. In appendix it is shown that behind the golden fraction of an image one can find the information basis, i.e. the proportion of the golden fraction corresponds to some method to find extremum. The method to find extrema associated with Fibonacci numbers also leads to proportions which can be seen in nature or can be introduced artificially. The information origin of proportions is proved theoretically and confirmed by examples in nature and human life.",Human
"The impact of a wedge-shaped body on the free surface of a weightless inviscid incompressible liquid is considered. Both symmetrical and unsymmetrical entries at constant velocity are dealt with. The differential problem corresponds to the physico-mathematical model of a distribution of potential singularities and, in particular, the flow singularities at the ends of the wetted regions are represented by sinks. A conformal transformation of the flow field is adopted and the unknown intensities of the discontinuities are found by an optimization procedure, together with the solution of the nonlinear free-surface problem. The flow separation at a sideslip is also considered.",Human
"Sample-to-sample fluctuations of the time-dependent conductance of a system with static disorder have been studied by means of diagrammatic theory and microwave pulsed transmission measurements. The fluctuations of time-dependent conductance are not universal, i.e., depend on sample parameters, in contrast to the universal conductance fluctuations in the steady-state regime. The variance of normalized conductance, determined by the infinite-range intensity correlation C_3(t), is found to increase as a third power of delay time from an exciting pulse, t. C_3(t) grows larger than the long-range intensity correlation C_2(t) after a time t_q ~ <g>^{1/2} t_D (t_D being the diffusion time, <g> being the average dimensionless conductance).",Human
"The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a recursive filter suitable for problems with a large number of variables, such as discretizations of partial differential equations in geophysical models. The EnKF originated as a version of the Kalman filter for large problems (essentially, the covariance matrix is replaced by the sample covariance), and it is now an important data assimilation component of ensemble forecasting. EnKF is related to the particle filter (in this context, a particle is the same thing as an ensemble member) but the EnKF makes the assumption that all probability distributions involved are Gaussian. This article briefly describes the derivation and practical implementation of the basic version of EnKF, and reviews several extensions.",Human
"Progress in the theory of anomalous diffusion in weakly turbulent cold magnetized plasmas is explained. Several proposed models advanced in the literature are discussed. Emphasis is put on a new proposed mechanism for anomalous diffusion transport mechanism based on the coupled action of conductive walls (excluding electrodes) bounding the plasma drain current (edge diffusion) together with the magnetic field flux ""cutting"" the area traced by the charged particles in their orbital motion. The same reasoning is shown to apply to the plasma core anomalous diffusion. The proposed mechanism is expected to be valid in regimes when plasma diffusion scales as Bohm diffusion and at high $B/N$, when collisions are of secondary importance.",Human
"This paper develops a detailed quantitative model which uses the Drake equation and an assumption of an average maximum radio broadcasting distance by an communicative civilization to derive a minimum civilization density for contact between two civilizations to be probable in a given volume of space under certain conditions, the amount of time it would take for a first contact, and whether reciprocal contact is possible. Results show that under certain assumptions, a galaxy can be teeming with civilizations yet not have a guarantee of communication between any of them given either short lifetimes or small maximum distances for communication.",Human
"Superconducting NbN wires have recently received attention as detectors for visible and infrared photons. We present experiments in which we use a NbN wire for high-efficiency (40 %) detection of single electrons with keV energy. We use the beam of a scanning electron microscope as a focussed, stable, and calibrated electron source. Scanning the beam over the surface of the wire provides a map of the detection efficiency. This map shows features as small as 150 nm, revealing wire inhomogeneities. The intrinsic resolution of this mapping method, superior to optical methods, provides the basis of a characterization tool relevant for photon detectors.",Human
"The absolute free energy -- or partition function, equivalently -- of a molecule can be estimated computationally using a suitable reference system. Here, we demonstrate a practical method for staging such calculations by growing a molecule based on a series of fragments. Significant computer time is saved by pre-calculating fragment configurations and interactions for re-use in a variety of molecules. We employ such fragment libraries and interaction tables for amino acids and capping groups to estimate free energies for small peptides. Equilibrium ensembles for the molecules are generated at no additional computational cost, and are used to check our results by comparison to standard dynamics simulation.",Human
"The process of cognition is analysed to adjust the set theory to physical description. Postulates and basic definitions are revised. The specific sets of predicates, called presets, corresponding to the physical objects identified by an observer during cognition are introduced. Unlike sets, the presets are free of logical or set-theoretical paradoxes and may be consistently used in physical description. Schemes of cognition based on presets are considered. Being different logical systems, the relativistic and quantum theories, observations in modern cosmology cannot be consistently considered in one `unified physical theory', but they are in frames of introduced schemes of cognition.",Human
"We discuss the strong spin segregation in a dilute trapped Fermi gas recently observed by Du et al. with ""anomalous"" large time scale and amplitude. In a collisionless regime, the atoms oscillate rapidly in the trap and average the inhomogeneous external field in an energy dependent way, which controls their transverse spin precession frequency. During interactions between atoms with different spin directions, the identical spin rotation effect (ISRE) transfers atoms to the up or down spin state, depending on their motional energy. Since low energy atoms are closer to the center of the trap than high energy atoms, the final outcome is a strong correlation between spins and positions.",Human
"We study oscillation death (OD) in a well-known coupled-oscillator system that has been used to model cardiovascular phenomena. We derive exact analytic conditions that allow the prediction of OD through the two known bifurcation routes, in the same model, and for different numbers of coupled oscillators. Our exact analytic results enable us to generalize OD as a multiparameter-sensitive phenomenon. It can be induced, not only by changes in couplings, but also by changes in the oscillator frequencies or amplitudes. We observe synchronization transitions as a function of coupling and confirm the robustness of the phenomena in the presence of noise. Numerical and analogue simulations are in good agreement with the theory.",Human
"Modern high-energy physics experiments collect data using dedicated complex multi-level trigger systems which perform an online selection of potentially interesting events. In general, this selection suffers from inefficiencies. A further loss of statistics occurs when the rate of accepted events is artificially scaled down in order to meet bandwidth constraints. An offline analysis of the recorded data must correct for the resulting losses in order to determine the original statistics of the analysed data sample. This is particularly challenging when data samples recorded by several triggers are combined. In this paper we present methods for the calculation of the offline corrections and study their statistical performance. Implications on building and operating trigger systems are discussed.",Human
"A data acquisition (DAQ) system is described which will be used for the next generation of prototype calorimeters using particle flow algorithms for the International Linear Collider (ILC). The design is sufficiently generic and scalable such that it should have numerous applications either for ILC detectors or elsewhere within high energy physics in general. The DAQ system will be implemented using FPGAs and built using off-the-shelf components and networking hardware with programmable FPGAs. The software for the DAQ system is based on an existing framework, DOOCS, which is a server/client object-oriented system. The design philosophy, current status of the project and its aims are presented in this report.",Human
"The ""LiC Detector Toy"" is a fast single-track simulation and reconstruction tool, aiming at the optimization of tracking detector design, i.e. geometric layout and material budgets. Its implementation is based on the MATLAB system. Improvements over the last year include correct handling of complex forward regions (arbitrary mixture of cylindrical and plane surfaces), enhanced detector description, flexible data presentation of results (e.g. fitted track resolutions and impact parameters), and support by an integrated GUI. In addition a non-GUI version running under open-source OCTAVE has been implemented. The tool has recently been used for fixing the ""reference design"" layout of the silicon tracker (SIT, SET and FTD) of the ILD detector concept.",Human
"We have calculated parity nonconserving 7s - 6d_{3/2} amplitude E_PNC in 223Ra+ using high-precision relativistic all-order method where all single and double excitations of the Dirac-Fock wave functions are included to all orders of perturbation theory. Detailed study of the uncertainty of the parity nonconserving (PNC) amplitude is carried out; additional calculations are performed to estimate some of the missing correlation corrections. A systematic study of the parity conserving atomic properties, including the calculation of the energies, transition matrix elements, lifetimes, hyperfine constants, quadrupole moments of the 6d states, as well as dipole and quadrupole ground state polarizabilities, is carried out. The results are compared with other theoretical calculations and available experimental values.",Human
"Lessons and homework problems involving a pendulum are often a big part of introductory physics classes and laboratory courses from high school to undergraduate levels. Although laboratory equipment for pendulum experiments is commercially available, it is often expensive and may not be affordable for teachers on fixed budgets, particularly in developing countries. We present a low-cost, easy-to-build rotary sensor pendulum using the existing hardware in a ball-type computer mouse. We demonstrate how this apparatus may be used to measure both the frequency and coefficient of damping of a simple physical pendulum. This easily constructed laboratory equipment makes it possible for all students to have hands-on experience with one of the most important simple physical systems.",Human
"We have measured the trapping lifetime of magnetically trapped atoms in a cryogenic atom-chip experiment. An ultracold atomic cloud is kept at a fixed distance from a thin gold layer deposited on top of a superconducting trapping wire. The lifetime is studied as a function of the distances to the surface and to the wire. Different regimes are observed, where loss rate is determined either by the technical current noise in the wire or the Johnson-Nyquist noise in the metallic gold layer, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Far from the surface, we observe exceptionally long trapping times for an atom-chip, in the 10-minutes range.",Human
"This paper reports on detailed measurements of the performance of Resistive Plate Chambers in a proton beam with variable intensity. Short term effects, such as dead time, are studied using consecutive events. On larger time scales, for various beam intensities the chamber.s efficiency is studied as a function of time within a spill of particles. The correlation between the efficiency of chambers placed in the same beam provides an indication of the lateral size of the observed effects. The measurements are compared to the predictions of a simple model based on the assumption that the resistive plates behave as pure resistors.",Human
"Mechanical oscillations are important for many cellular processes, e.g. the beating of cilia and flagella or the sensation of sound by hair cells. These dynamic states originate from spontaneous oscillations of molecular motors. A particularly clear example of such oscillations has been observed in muscle fibers under non-physiological conditions. In that case, motor oscillations lead to contraction waves along the fiber. By a macroscopic analysis of muscle fiber dynamics we find that the spontaneous waves involve non-hydrodynamic modes. A simple microscopic model of sarcomere dynamics highlights mechanical aspects of the motor dynamics and fits with the experimental observations.",Human
"Precision navigation of spacecraft requires accurate knowledge of small forces, including the recoil force due to anisotropies of thermal radiation emitted by spacecraft systems. We develop a formalism to derive the thermal recoil force from the basic principles of radiative heat exchange and energy-momentum conservation. The thermal power emitted by the spacecraft can be computed from engineering data obtained from flight telemetry, which yields a practical approach to incorporate the thermal recoil force into precision spacecraft navigation. Alternatively, orbit determination can be used to estimate the contribution of the thermal recoil force. We apply this approach to the Pioneer anomaly using a simulated Pioneer 10 Doppler data set.",Human
"The epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) tunneling phenomenon allows full transmission of waves through a narrow channel even in the presence of a strong geometric mismatch. Here we experimentally demonstrate nonlinear control of the ENZ tunneling by an external field, as well as self-modulation of the transmission resonance due to the incident wave. Using a waveguide section near cut-off frequency as the ENZ system, we introduce a diode with tunable and nonlinear capacitance to demonstrate both of these effects. Our results confirm earlier theoretical ideas on using an ENZ channel for dielectric sensing, and their potential applications for tunable slow-light structures.",Human
In this paper we theoretically show that the Raman scattering by a core-shell micron or submicron particle with epsilon-near-zero metamaterial shell and silica spherical or cylindrical core can combine useful features of cavity-enhanced and surface-enhanced Raman scattering. The cavity resonance together with the plasmon resonance lead to the giant enhancement of the field inside the metashell which is performed as a layer of silver or gold nanoparticles and is penetrable for molecules to be detected. This approach results in the significant increase of both effective volume in which molecules are affected by enhanced electric field and Raman gain averaged over this volume.,Human
"This work presents a new Visual Basic 6.0 application for estimating the fractal dimension of images, based on an optimized version of the box-counting algorithm. Following the attempt to separate the real information from noise, we considered also the family of all band-pass filters with the same band-width (specified as parameter). The fractal dimension can be thus represented as a function of the pixel color code. The program was used for the study of paintings cracks, as an additional tool which can help the critic to decide if an artistic work is original or not. In its second version, the application was extended for working also with csv files and three-dimensional images.",Human
"A new delay equation is introduced to describe the punctuated evolution of complex nonlinear systems. A detailed analytical and numerical investigation provides the classification of all possible types of solutions for the dynamics of a population in the four main regimes dominated respectively by: (i) gain and competition, (ii) gain and cooperation, (iii) loss and competition and (iv) loss and cooperation. Our delay equation may exhibit bistability in some parameter range, as well as a rich set of regimes, including monotonic decay to zero, smooth exponential growth, punctuated unlimited growth, punctuated growth or alternation to a stationary level, oscillatory approach to a stationary level, sustainable oscillations, finite-time singularities as well as finite-time death.",Human
"In the given work the first attempt to generalize quantum uncertainty relation on macro objects is made. Business company as one of economical process participants was chosen by the authors for this purpose. The analogies between quantum micro objects and the structures which from the first sight do not have anything in common with physics are given. The proof of generalized uncertainty relation is produced. With the help of generalized uncertainty relation the authors wanted to elaborate a new non-traditional approach to the description of companies' business activity and their developing and try to formulate some advice for them. Thus, our work makes the base of quantum theory of econimics",Human
"Recent full-particle simulations of electron-positron reconnection have revealed that the Weibel instability plays an active role in controlling the dynamics of the current layer and maintaining fast reconnection. A four-beam model is developed to explore the development of the instability within a narrow current layer characteristic of reconnection. The problem is reduced to two coupled second-order differential equations, whose growing eigenmodes are obtained via both asymptotic approximations and finite difference methods. Full particle simulations confirm the linear theory and help probe the nonlinear development of the instability. The current layer broadening in the reconnection outflow jet is linked to the scattering of high-velocity streaming particles in the Weibel-generated, out-of-plane magnetic field.",Human
"It is shown that the Shan-Chen (SC) model for non-ideal lattice fluids can be made compliant with a pseudo free-energy principle by simple addition of a gradient force, whose expression is uniquely specified in terms of the fluid density. This additional term is numerically shown to provide fairly negligible effects on the system evolution during phase-separation. To the best of our knowledge, these important properties of the SC model were not noted before. The approach developed in the present work is based on a continuum analysis: further extensions, more in line with a discrete lattice theory (X. Shan, {\it Phys Rev E}, {\bf 77} 066702 (2008)) can be envisaged for the future.",Human
"Alignment of the ILC main linac will be more critical than for any currently existing accelerators due to its long length and the ultra low emittance required. There are several techniques for measuring the ILC reference network; in this report conventional methods for measuring the network and aligning the main linac are simulated. Dispersion Matched Steering (DMS) is applied to the simulated accelerators to determine their final emittance. Simulations and reconstructions of the ILC reference network usually require very resource intensive programs, the RTRSM has been developed to rapidly generate networks with the required statistical properties. The RTRSM is discussed in this report and some problems are demonstrated.",Human
"We describe students revising the mathematical form of physics equations to match the physical situation they are describing, even though their revision violates physical laws. In an unfamiliar air resistance problem, a majority of students in a sophomore level mechanics class at some point wrote Newton's Second Law as F = -ma; they were using this form to ensure that the sign of the force pointed in a direction consistent with the chosen coordinate system while assuming that some variables have only positive value. We use one student's detailed explanation to suggest that students' issues with variables are context-dependent, and that much of their reasoning is useful for productive instruction.",Human
"The SO(5)>SO(3) spherical harmonics form a natural basis for expansion of nuclear collective model angular wave functions. They underlie the recently-proposed algebraic method for diagonalization of the nuclear collective model Hamiltonian in an SU(1,1)xSO(5) basis. We present a computer code for explicit construction of the SO(5)>SO(3) spherical harmonics and use them to compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients needed for collective model calculations in an SO(3)-coupled basis. With these Clebsch-Gordan coefficients it becomes possible to compute the matrix elements of collective model observables by purely algebraic methods.",Human
"Based on measurements of nonlinear second sound resonances in a high-quality resonator, we have observed a steady-state wave energy cascade in He II involving a flux of energy through the spectral range towards high frequencies. We show that the energy balance in the wave system is nonlocal in K-space and that the frequency scales of energy pumping and dissipation are widely separated. The wave amplitude distribution follows a power law over a wide range of frequencies. Numerical computations yield results in agreement with the experimental observations. We suggest that second sound cascades of this kind may be useful for model studies of acoustic turbulence.",Human
"Atoms from an otherwise unconfined 87Rb condensate are shown to be suspended against gravity using repeated reflections from a pulsed optical standing wave. Reflection efficiency was optimized using a triple-pulse sequence that, theoretically, provides accuracies better than 99.9%. Experimentally, up to 100 reflections are observed, leading to dynamical suspension for over 100 ms. The velocity sensitivity of the reflections can be used to determine the local gravitational acceleration. Further, a gravitationally sensitive atom interferometer was implemented using the suspended atoms, with packet coherence maintained for a similar time. These techniques could be useful for the precise measurement of gravity when it is impractical to allow atoms to fall freely over a large distance.",Human
"The fullerene (C60) nanowires, which possess a highly unusual morphology featured by a prism-like central core and three nanobelt-like wings joined along the growth direction to give an overall Y-shaped cross section, have been studied. The experimental observation coupled with theoretical calculation have enabled us to elucidate both the role of the fullerene and of the solvent in the crystallization process, thus opening up an opportunity for the in-depth understanding of the crystal growth mechanism. More generally, the method developed in this work could be extended into understanding the growth of other inorganic nanowires that have both host and guest molecules involved in their crystal lattices.",Human
A stable light source obtained using sum-frequency generation (SFG) is developed for high-resolution spectroscopy at 578 nm. Hyperfine transitions of molecular iodine are observed by using the SFG light source with saturation spectroscopy. The light source is frequency stabilized to the observed hyperfine transition and achieves a stability of 2*10-12 for a 1-s averaging time. The absolute frequency of the light source stabilized on the a1 component of the R(37)16-1 transition is determined as 518304551833 (2) kHz. This transition serves as a frequency reference for the 1S0 - 3P0 optical clock transition in neutral ytterbium (Yb).,Human
"Multipole radiofrequency ion traps are a highly versatile tool to study molecular ions and their interactions in a well-controllable environment. In particular the cryogenic 22-pole ion trap configuration is used to study ion-molecule reactions and complex molecular spectroscopy at temperatures between few Kelvin and room temperatures. This article presents a tutorial on radiofrequency ion trapping in multipole electrode configurations. Stable trapping conditions and buffer gas cooling, as well as important heating mechanisms, are discussed. In addition, selected experimental studies on cation and anion-molecule reactions and on spectroscopy of trapped ions are reviewed. Starting from these studies an outlook on the future of multipole ion trap research is given.",Human
"The series expansion formulae are established for the one- and two-center charge densities over complete orthonormal sets of exponential type orbitals introduced by the author. Three-center overlap integrals of appearing in these relations are expressed through the two-center overlap integrals between -orbitals. The general formulae obtained for the charge densities are utilized for the evaluation of arbitrary multicenter-multielectron integrals occurring when the complete orthonormal sets of exponential type orbitals are used as basis functions in the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan and explicitly correlated methods. The relationships for charge densities and multicenter-multielectron integrals obtained are valid for the arbitrary quantum numbers, screening constants and location of orbitals.",Human
"Improvement in time resolution sometimes introduces short-range random noises into temporal data sequences. These noises affect the results of power-spectrum analyses and the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The DFA is one of useful methods for analyzing long-range correlations in non-stationary sequences. The effects of noises are discussed based on artificial temporal sequences. Short-range noises prevent power-spectrum analyses from detecting long-range correlations. The DFA can extract long-range correlations from noisy time sequences. The DFA also gives the threshold time length, under which the noises dominate. For practical analyses, coarse-grained time sequences are shown to recover long-range correlations.",Human
"We report on strong coupling between surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and Rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules, with double vacuum Rabi splitting energies up to 230 and 110 meV. In addition, we demonstrate the emission of all three energy branches of the strongly coupled SPP-exciton hybrid system, revealing features of system dynamics that are not visible in conventional reflectometry. Finally, in analogy to tunable-Q microcavities, we show that the Rabi splitting can be controlled by adjusting the interaction time between waveguided SPPs and R6G deposited on top of the waveguide. The interaction time can be controlled with sub-fs precision by adjusting the length of the R6G area with standard lithography methods.",Human
"The high arithmetic performance and intrinsic parallelism of recent graphical processing units (GPUs) can offer a technological edge for molecular dynamics simulations. ACEMD is a production-class bio-molecular dynamics (MD) simulation program designed specifically for GPUs which is able to achieve supercomputing scale performance of 40 nanoseconds/day for all-atom protein systems with over 23,000 atoms. We illustrate the characteristics of the code, its validation and performance. We also run a microsecond-long trajectory for an all-atom molecular system in explicit TIP3P water on a single workstation computer equipped with just 3 GPUs. This performance on cost effective hardware allows ACEMD to reach microsecond timescales routinely with important implications in terms of scientific applications.",Human

It consists of a series of routines that can be interfaced with the most popular classical molecular dynamics (MD) codes through a simple patching procedure. This leaves the possibility for the user to exploit many different MD engines depending on the system simulated and on the computational resources available. Free-energy calculations can be performed as a function of many collective variables, with a particular focus on biological problems, and using state-of-the-art methods such as metadynamics, umbrella sampling and Jarzynski-equation based steered MD. The present software, written in ANSI-C language, can be easily interfaced with both fortran and C/C++ codes.",Human
"Lorentz's reciprocity lemma and Feld-Tai reciprocity theorem show the effect of interchanging the action and reaction in Maxwell's equations. We derive a free-space version of these reciprocity relations which generalizes the conservation of the momentum-energy tensor. This relation corresponds to the interference conservation of electromagnetic waves. We show that for any transformation or symmetry that leaves Maxwell's equations invariant, we can modify the reciprocity relation to introduce a conserving density, optical flux and stress tensor extending Noether's theorem to a different context. We apply this method to transformations that can be expressed as Hermitian operators and more specifically we define the operators associated with the optical energy, spin, linear and angular momentum.",Human
"The Golden ratio which appears in the geometry of a variety of creations in Nature is found to arise right in the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom due to the opposite charges of the electron and proton. The bond length of the hydrogen molecule is the diagonal of a square on the Bohr radius and hence also has two Golden sections, which form the cationic and anionic radii of hydrogen. It is shown here that these radii account for the bond lengths of many hydrides when added to the atomic and Golden ratio based ionic radii of many other atoms.",Human
"The rock mechanical design of gas storage cavern in salt requires the analysis of the stability and the usability of the cavern over the planned operating time period. The design includes the build up of a rock mass model and a numerical model taking into account the geological situation, load condition, geometrical condition, and material parameters. In this paper multiple caverns in salt formation with geological and geomechanical situation in Qom (central part of Iran) was investigated a using creep model. Minimum safe center to center distances (CTCD) of multiple horizontal caverns also were studied. CTCD of caverns interact at less than two times of cavern diameter. With increasing the CTCD to 2.5 times cavern diameters, diminish most interaction.",Human
"A novel nanometeric plasmonic filter in a tooth-shaped Metal-Insulator-Metal waveguide is proposed and demonstrated numerically. An analytic model based on the scattering matrix method is given. The result reveals that the single tooth-shaped filter has a wavelength filtering characteristic and an ultra-compact size in the length of a few hundred nanometers, compared to grating-like SPPs filters. Both analytic and simulation results show that the wavelength of the trough of the transmission has linear and nonlinear relationships with the tooth depth and the tooth width, respectively. The waveguide filter could be utilized to develop ultra-compact photonic filters for high integration.",Human

By utilizing high speed micromirrors with a broadband metallic coating, our system has the flexibility to simultaneously incorporate a wide range of wavelengths and multiple beams. We demonstrate reconfiguration of two independent beams at different wavelengths (780 and 635 nm) across a common 5x5 array with 4 us settling time. Full simulation of the optical system provides insights on the scalability of the system. Such a system can provide a versatile tool for applications where fast laser multiplexing is necessary.",Human
"The beam-beam interaction is one of the dominant sources of emittance growth and luminosity lifetime deterioration. A current carrying wire has been proposed to compensate long-range beam-beam effects in the LHC and strong localized long-range beam-beam effects are experimentally investigated in the RHIC collider. Tune shift, beam transfer function, and beam loss rate are measured in dedicated experiments. In this paper, we report on simulations to study the effect of beam-wire interactions based on diffusive apertures, beam loss rates, and beam transfer function using a parallelized weak-strong beam simulation code (bbsimc). The simulation results are compared with measurements performed in RHIC during 2007 and 2008.",Human
"In particle-based algorithms, the effect of binary collisions is commonly described in a statistical way, using Monte Carlo techniques. It is shown that, in the relativistic regime, stringent constraints should be considered on the sampling of particle pairs for collision, which are critical to ensure physically meaningful results, and that nonrelativistic sampling criteria (e.g., uniform random pairing) yield qualitatively wrong results, including equilibrium distributions that differ from the theoretical J\""uttner distribution. A general procedure for relativistically consistent algorithms is provided, and verified with three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, thus opening the way to the numerical exploration of the statistical properties of collisional relativistic systems.",Human
"The subsystems of the CMS silicon strip tracker were integrated and commissioned at the Tracker Integration Facility (TIF) in the period from November 2006 to July 2007. As part of the commissioning, large samples of cosmic ray data were recorded under various running conditions in the absence of a magnetic field. Cosmic rays detected by scintillation counters were used to trigger the readout of up to 15% of the final silicon strip detector, and over 4.7 million events were recorded. This document describes the cosmic track reconstruction and presents results on the performance of track and hit reconstruction as from dedicated analyses.",Human
"We study theoretically the rate of spontaneous emission of a two-level quantum emitter embedded in realistic systems: near a mirror, near a plasmonic sphere, or in a 3D photonic bandgap crystal. At constant frequency and position, we find striking (up to $10^{2}\times$) variations in emission rate by varying the orientation of the transition dipole moment. We present a general representation of rate versus orientation that only invokes symmetry of the Green function. The concomitant 3-dimensional geometric surfaces provide much insight in how preferred orientations for enhancement (or inhibition) depend on the emitter's frequency and location, and on optimal strategies to actively switch emission rates by controlling oriented dipoles.",Human
"We present a model for the rate of temperature relaxation between electrons and ions in plasmas. The model includes self-consistently the effects of particle screening, electron degeneracy and correlations between electrons and ions. We successfully validate the model over a wide range of plasma coupling against molecular-dynamics simulations of classical plasma of like-charged electrons and ions. We present calculations of the relaxation rates in dense hydrogen and show that, while electron-ion correlation effects are indispensable in classical, like-charged plasmas at any density and temperature, quantum diffraction effects prevail over e-i correlation effects in dense hydrogen plasmas.",Human
"The special theory of relativity is the foundation of modern physics, but its unusual postulate of invariant vacuum speed of light results in a number of plausible paradoxes. This situation leads to radical criticisms and suspicions against the theory of relativity. In this paper, from the perspective that the relativity is nothing but a geometry, we give a uniform resolution to some famous and typical paradoxes such as the ladder paradox, the Ehrenfest's rotational disc paradox. The discussion shows that all the paradoxes are caused by misinterpretation of concepts. We misused the global simultaneity and the principle of relativity. As a geometry of Minkowski space-time, special relativity can never result in a logical contradiction.",Human
"In this paper we present a statistical study of edge fluctuations taken with the Gas Puffing Imaging (GPI) diagnostics. We carry out a comparison of GPI signal from an extensive database including four devices (two Tokamaks and two Reversed Field Pinches). The data are analyzed in terms of their statistical moments Skewness and Kurtosis, as done in [B. Labit, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{98}, 255002 (2007)]. The data align along parabolic curves, although different from machine to machine, with some spread around the best-fitting curve. A discussion about the meaning of the parabolic trend as well as the departure of real data from it is provided. A phenomenological model is finally provided, attempting to accomodate experimental evidence.",Human
The form $A\cdot exp(-(x-c)^2 /(a(x-c)+2b^2))$ is an asymmetric distribution intermediate between the normal and exponential distributions. Some specific properties of the form are presented and methods of approximation are offered. Appropriate formulae and table are presented. The practical problems of approximation by the form are discussed with connection to the quality of original data. Application of the methods is illustrated by using in the problem of calculating and studying distribution function of maximum ultra high energy atmospheric showers. Relationship with exponential and normal distributions makes usage of the form to be effective in practice.,Human
"In every sphere of science, theories make predictions and experiments validate them. However, common experience suggests that theoretically predicted exact magnitude for a parameter, constitute a small subset of all the experimentally obtained magnitudes for that particular parameter. Typically, irrespective of the branch of science and the particular problem under consideration, the set of obtained experimental results form an interval [x_min,x_max], within which the theoretically predicted magnitude, say 'x', occurs with time, apparently randomly. We attempt here to find the characteristics of the statistical distribution of events of experimental observation of the occurrence of theoretically predicted 'x'; in other words, characterization of the time interval when theoretical predictions match the experimental readings, exactly.",Human
"We study the evolution of networks when the creation and decay of links are based on the position of nodes in the network measured by their centrality. We show that the same network dynamics arises under various centrality measures, and solve analytically the network evolution. During the complete evolution, the network is characterized by nestedness: the neighbourhood of a node is contained in the neighbourhood of the nodes with larger degree. We find a discontinuous transition in the network density between hierarchical and homogeneous networks, depending on the rate of link decay. We also show that this evolution mechanism leads to double power-law degree distributions, with interrelated exponents.",Human
"We report on spectroscopy and time-of-flight measurements using an 18 keV fast-pulsed photoelectron source of adjustable intensity, ranging from single photoelectrons per pulse to 5 photoelectrons per microsecond at pulse repetition rates of up to 10 kHz. Short pulses between 40 ns and 40 microseconds in length were produced by switching light emitting diodes with central output wavelengths of 265 nm and 257 nm, in the deep ultraviolet (or UV-C) regime, at kHz frequencies. Such photoelectron sources can be useful calibration devices for testing the properties of high-resolution electrostatic spectrometers, like the ones used in current neutrino mass searches.",Human
"The application of quadrupole-devices with high field gradients and small apertures requires precise control over higher order multipole field components. We present a new scheme for performance control and tuning, which allows the illumination of most of the quadrupole-device aperture because of the reduction of higher order field components. Consequently, the size of the aperture can be minimized to match the beam size achieving field gradients of up to 500 T/m at good imaging quality. The characterization method based on a Hall probe measurement and a Fourier analysis was confirmed using the high quality electron beam at the Mainz Microtron MAMI.",Human
"Community identification is a long-standing challenge in the modern network science, especially for very large scale networks containing millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a new metric to quantify the structural similarity between subgraphs, based on which an algorithm for community identification is designed. Extensive empirical results on several real networks from disparate fields has demonstrated that the present algorithm can provide the same level of reliability, measure by modularity, while takes much shorter time than the well-known fast algorithm proposed by Clauset, Newman and Moore (CNM). We further propose a hybrid algorithm that can simultaneously enhance modularity and save computational time compared with the CNM algorithm.",Human
"The first kinetic study of transient growth for a collisionless homogeneous Maxwellian plasma in a uniform magnetic field is presented. A system which is linearly stable may display transient growth if the linear operator describing its evolution is non-normal, so that its eigenvectors are non-orthogonal. In order to include plasma kinetic effects a Landau fluid model is employed. The linear operator of the model is shown to be non-normal and the results suggest that the nonnormality of a collisionless plasma is intrinsically related to its kinetic nature, with the transient growth being more accentuated for smaller scales and higher plasma beta. The results based on linear spectral theory have been confirmed with nonlinear simulations.",Human
"In this work we mimic the efficient propulsion mechanism of natural cilia by magnetically actuating thin films in a cyclic but non-reciprocating manner. By simultaneously solving the elasto-dynamic, magnetostatic and fluid mechanics equations, we show that the amount of fluid propelled is proportional to the area swept by the cilia. By using the intricate interplay between film magnetization and applied field we are able to generate a pronounced asymmetry and associated flow. We delineate the functional response of the system in terms of three dimensionless parameters that capture the relative contribution of elastic, inertial, viscous and magnetic forces.",Human
"Doping a helium nanodroplet with a tiny xenon cluster of a few atoms only, sparks complete ionization of the droplet at laser intensities below the ionization threshold of helium atoms. As a result, the intrinsically inert and transparent droplet turns into a fast and strong absorber of infrared light. Microscopic calculations reveal a two-step mechanism to be responsible for the dramatic change: Avalanche-like ionization of the helium atoms on a femtosecond time scale, driven by field ionization due to the quickly charged xenon core is followed by resonant absorption enabled by an unusual cigar-shaped nanoplasma within the droplet.",Human
"We generate a 200-nm optical frequency comb at 1.5 microns by injecting two single-frequency lasers into a highly nonlinear fiber, and explore its spectral phase properties and high power to demonstrate full nonlinear conversion into its second harmonic. Combs of optical frequencies with 100-nm (~ 48 THz) bandwidths, centered at 790-800 nm and spaced by 0.8-1 nm (380-470 GHz) were produced by second harmonic and multiple sum frequency generation simply by focusing into a 2-mm long nonlinear crystal. Conventional birefringence phase matching was used in normal incidence configuration without tilting the crystal.",Human
"In light of some recent experiments on quasi two-dimensional (2D) turbulent channel flow we provide here a model of the ideal case, for the sake of comparison. The ideal 2D channel flow differs from its 3D counterpart by having a second quadratic conserved variable in addition to the energy, and the latter has an inverse rather than a direct cascade. The resulting qualitative differences in profiles of velocity, V, and energy, K, as a function of the distance from the wall are highlighted and explained. The most glaring difference is that the 2D channel is much more energetic, with K in wall units increasing logarithmically with the Reynolds number $\Ret$ instead of being $\Ret$-independent in 3D channels.",Human
"Swift, high resolution CMOS pixel sensors are being developed for the ILC vertex detector, aiming to allow approaching the interaction point very closely. A major issue is the time resolution of the sensors needed to deal with the high occupancy generated by the beam related background. A 128x576 pixel sensor providing digitised outputs at a read-out time of 92.5 us, was fabricated in 2008 within the EU project EUDET, and tested with charged particles at the CERN-SPS. Its prominent performances in terms of noise, detection efficiency versus fake hit rate, spatial resolution and radiation tolerance are overviewed. They validate the sensor architecture.",Human
"In this paper, using a standard quantum chemistry approach based on pseudopotentials for atomic core representation, Gaussian basis sets, and effective core polarization potentials, we investigate the electronic properties of the MgH$^+$ ion. We first determine potential energy curves for several states using different basis sets and discuss their predicted accuracy by comparing our values of the well depths and position with other available results. We then calculate permanent and transition dipole moments for several transitions. Finally for the first time, we calculate the static dipole polarizability of MgH$^+$ as function of the interatomic distance. This study represents the first step towards the modeling of collisions between trapped cold Mg$^+$ ions and H$_2$ molecules.",Human
"Finding and sampling multiple reaction channels for molecular transitions remains an important challenge in physical chemistry. Here we show that the weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling method can readily sample multiple channels. In a first test, both the WE and transition path sampling methods are applied to two-dimensional model potentials. The comparison explains why the weighted ensemble approach will not be trapped in one channel. The WE approach is then used to sample the full transition path ensemble in implicitly solvated alanine dipeptide at two different temperatures. The ensembles are of sufficient quality to permit quantification of the fractional importance of each channel, even at T=300K when brute-force simulation is prohibitively expensive.",Human
"When the atoms of a dimer remain most of the time very far apart, in so-called long-range molecular states, their mutual interaction is ruled by plain atomic properties. The high-resolution spectroscopic study of some molecular excited states populated by photoassociation of cold atoms (photoassociative spectroscopy) gives a good illustration of this property. It provides accurate determinations of atomic radiative lifetimes, which are known to be sensitive tests for atomic calculations. A number of such analyses has been performed up to now, for all stable alkali atoms and for some other atomic species (Ca, Sr, Yb). A systematic review of these determinations is attempted here, with special attention paid to accuracy issues.",Human
"By investigating the quantum properties of magnetically trapped nS Rydberg atoms, it is demonstrated that the composite nature of Rydberg atoms significantly alters their trapping properties opposed to point-like particles with the same magnetic moment. We show how the specific signatures of the Rydberg trapping potential can be probed by means of ground state atoms that are off-resonantly coupled to the Rydberg state via a two photon laser transition. In addition, it is demonstrated how this approach provides new possibilities for generating traps for ground state atoms. Simulated time-of-flight pictures mirroring the experimental situation are provided.",Human
"The ultimate active constituents of the living medium, membranes, ions and molecules, are at the level of the nanometer. Their interactions thus require a quantum processing. The characteristic Action A, linked to the ""quantum objects"" : ions, radicals, water molecule... of the living medium, has an average value of A ~= 14.10-34 J.s or A ~= 2 h . It is thus strictly impossible to formulate a realistic ""classical "" theory of membrane electrodynamics. The transfer of the sodium ion - among others - could be then ensured under the action of a Tunnel effect, (with Hartman?s mechanism) specific to the channel and the ion transferred.",Human
The CALICE prototype for a Si/W electromagnetic calorimeter has been tested in large scale test beams. Several million events with electrons and hadrons of different energies and impact angles have been recorded. The energy resolution has been measured to be (16.6 +- 0.1)%/sqrt(E(GeV)) for the stochastic and (1.1 +- 0.1)% for the constant term with a linearity within the 1% level. The next step will be the construction of a large scale prototype which will take realistic experimental costraints into account. This module will naturally benefit from the experience gained with the first prototype.,Human
"We discuss the feasibility to realize a space cold atom clock with counter-propagating cold atoms in microgravity. The design of the space clock is based on atomic beam clock with a Ramsey cavity, except a magneto-optical trap (MOT) is placed at each side. Cold atoms are launched from MOTs at both side of the clock simultaneously and move at counter-direction towards each other. The velocity of launched atoms is precisely controlled to the Ramsauer-Townsend resonance so that no additional collision frequency shift is taken place. Such a configuration can efficiently cancel the frequency shift led from cavity phase shift and increase the signal to noise.",Human
"One important issue implied by the finite nature of real-world networks regards the identification of their more external (border) and internal nodes. The present work proposes a formal and objective definition of these properties, founded on the recently introduced concept of node diversity. It is shown that this feature does not exhibit any relevant correlation with several well-established complex networks measurements. A methodology for the identification of the borders of complex networks is described and illustrated with respect to theoretical (geographical and knitted networks) as well as real-world networks (urban and word association networks), yielding interesting results and insights in both cases.",Human
"Analysis of fluorescent spectra from complex biological systems containing various fluorescent probes with overlapping emission bands is a challenging task. Valuable information can be extracted from the full spectra, however, by using multivariate analysis (MA) of measurements at different wavelengths. We applied MA to spectral data of purified Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) protein reconstituted into liposomes made up of dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) doped with two extrinsic fluorescent probes (NBD-cholesterol/pyrene-PC). Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was observed between the protein and pyrene-PC and between pyrene-PC and NBD-cholesterol, leading to overlapping emission bands. Partial least squares analysis was applied to ...",Human
"Molecular motors are single macromolecules that generate forces at the piconewton range and nanometer scale. They convert chemical energy into mechanical work by moving along filamentous structures. In this paper, we study the velocity of two-head molecular motors in the framework of a mechanochemical network theory. The network model, a generalization of the recently work of Liepelt and Lipowsky (PRL 98, 258102 (2007)), is based on the discrete mechanochemical states of a molecular motor with multiple cycles. By generalizing the mathematical method developed by Fisher and Kolomeisky for single cycle motor (PNAS(2001) 98(14) P7748-7753), we are able to obtain an explicit formula for the velocity of a molecular motor.",Human
"At many universities, astronomy is a popular way for non-science majors to fulfill a general education requirement. Because general-education astronomy may be the only college-level science course taken by these students, it is the last chance to shape the science attitudes of these future journalists, teachers, politicians, and voters. I report on an attempt to measure and induce changes in science attitudes in my general-education astronomy course. I describe construction of the attitude survey, classroom activities designed to influence attitudes, and give numerical results indicating a significant improvement. In contrast, the literature on attitudes in introductory physics courses generally reports stagnation or decline. I briefly comment on some plausible explanations for this difference.",Human
"For a narrow slit structure backed by a conducting strip which is taken as a representative example of an aperture-body resonance (ABR) problem, the transmission resonance condition (i.e., condition for maximum power transmission) and the transmission width (i.e., normalized maximum transmitted power through the slit) are found to be the same as those for narrow slit coupling problem in a thick conducting screen, which is designated as a transmission-cavity resonance (TCR) problem. From a viewpoint of equivalent circuit representation for the transmission resonance condition and the funneling mechanism, the ABR and the TCR problems are thought to be essentially of the same nature.",Human
"Through the introduction of a class of appropriate translationally invariant trial wave functions, we show that the strong correlations in the lowest Landau level (LLL) reflect in finite systems the emergence of intrinsic point-group symmetries associated with rotations and vibrations of molecules formed through particle localization. This quantal molecular description is universal, being valid for both bosons and fermions, for both the yrast and excited states of the LLL spectra, and for both low and high angular momenta. ""Quantum-fluid"" physical pictures associated with Jastrow-type trial functions are shown to be reducible to the molecular description introduced in this paper.",Human
"A solution to the dark matter problem is set forth in the framework of reductive semiclassical gravity, i.e., semiclassical gravity involving quantum state reduction. In that theory, the Einstein equation includes the energy-momentum tensor originating from pseudomatter and partially compensating for quantum jumps of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The compensation ensures the continuity of metric and of its first time derivative. Pseudomatter is actualized as pseudodust and perceived as a dark matter. The necessity of compensating for quantum jumps makes pseudomatter, i.e., dark matter of such a form, an indispensable rather than ad hoc element of the theory. Applications: The Schwarzschild solution with pseudomatter, pseudomatter halo, collapse involving pseudomatter, pseudomatter in the FLRW universe.",Human
"Bodies of density one half (of the fluid in which they are immersed) that can float in all orientations are investigated. It is shown that expansions starting from and deforming the (hyper)sphere are possible in arbitrary dimensions and allow for a large manifold of solutions: One may either (i) expand r(n)+r(-n) in powers of a given difference r(u)-r(-u), (r(n) denoting the distance from the origin in direction n). Or (ii) the envelope of the water planes (for fixed body and varying direction of gravitation) may be given. Equivalently r(n) can be expanded in powers of the distance h(u) of the water planes from the origin perpendicular to u.",Human
"We analyze the various approaches to construct exchange-correlation functionals which are able to describe states of definite spin multiplicity in the DFT realm and outline the characteristics of possible functionals consistent with the Kohn-Sham theory. To achieve this goal the unitary group technique is applied to label many-electron states of definite total spin and to calculate the corresponding analogs of the Roothaan coupling coefficients. The possibility of using range separated Coulomb potential of electron-electron interaction for constructing functionals discriminating multiplet states in the d-shells is explored and a tentative system of state-specific functionals, covering nontrivial correlations in d-shells of transition metal ions, is proposed for the Fe^{2+} ions.",Human
We study the local distortion of the atomic structure in small biological samples illuminated by x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses. We concentrate on the effect of inhomogenities: heavy atoms in a light matrix and non-homogeneous spatial distribution of atoms. In biological systems we find both. Using molecular-dynamics type modeling it is shown that the local distortions about heavy atoms are larger than the average distortion in the light matrix. Further it is also shown that the large spatial density fluctuations also significantly alter the time evolution of atomic displacements as compared to samples with uniform density. This fact has serious consequences on single particle imaging. This is discussed and the possibility of a correction is envisaged.,Human
"In this brief note we describe two devices, a sort of flat and spherical capacitor, with which one should be able to test the possibility of creating a macroscopic voltage, and thus exploitable current, out of a single thermal source at room temperature. The basic idea is trivial and it makes use of a thermo-emitting cathode with work function as low as 0.7eV. The idea is not completely new, but our approach is simpler and neat. When implemented, it should allow to assess if approaches based on thermo-ionic materials at room temperature really violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics macroscopically.",Human
We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA hairpins that fold/unfold under the action of applied mechanical force. We introduce the concept of the molecular free energy landscape and derive simplified expressions for the force dependent Kramers-Bell rates. To test the theory we have designed a specific DNA hairpin sequence that shows two-state cooperative folding under mechanical tension and carried out pulling experiments using optical tweezers. We show how we can determine the parameters that characterize the molecular free energy landscape of such sequence from rupture force kinetic studies. Finally we combine such kinetic studies with experimental investigations of the Crooks fluctuation relation to derive the free energy of formation of the hairpin at zero force.,Human
We investigate irreversibility and dissipation in single molecules that cooperatively fold/unfold in a two state manner under the action of mechanical force. We apply path thermodynamics to derive analytical expressions for the average dissipated work and the average hopping number in two state systems. It is shown how these quantities only depend on two parameters that characterize the folding/unfolding kinetics of the molecule: the fragility and the coexistence hopping rate. The latter has to be rescaled to take into account the appropriate experimental setup. Finally we carry out pulling experiments with optical tweezers in a specifically designed DNA hairpin that shows two-state cooperative folding. We then use these experimental results to validate our theoretical predictions.,Human
"A system of 'telegrapher's' equations for a number of long lines joined into a network is studied. Explicit formulas for Fourier transforms of current and voltage are derived. These formulas are very suitable for computer application as well as for the analytical study of processes o networks. As an example, the availability of formulas aids the derivation of explicit formulas for maxima of current amplitude over the given class of admissible external influences. These values may be used to indicate the characteristic of network robustness to excess voltage or electromagnetic impulse. The approach is based on the operational solution already proposed by the author for more general partial differential equations on graphs.",Human
"To identify communities in directed networks, we propose a generalized form of modularity in directed networks by introducing a new quantity LinkRank, which can be considered as the PageRank of links. This generalization is consistent with the original modularity in undirected networks and the modularity optimization methods developed for undirected networks can be directly applied to directed networks by optimizing our new modularity. Also, a model network, which can be used as a benchmark network in further community studies, is proposed to verify our method. Our method is supposed to find communities effectively in citation- or reference-based directed networks.",Human
"Using the relativistic coupled-cluster method, we have calculated ionization potentials, E1 matrix elements and dipole polarizabilities of many low-lying states of Ca$^+$. Contributions from the Breit interaction are given explicitly for these properties. Polarizabilities of the ground and the first excited d-states are determined by evaluating the wave functions that are perturbed to first order by the electric dipole operator and the black-body radiation shifts are estimated from these results. We also report the results of branching ratios and lifetimes of the first excited p-states using both the calculated and experimental wavelengths and compare them with their measured values.",Human
A general scenario for electronic charge migration in finite samples illuminated by an intense laser pulse is given. Microscopic calculations for neon clusters under strong short pulses as produced by X-ray free-electron laser sources confirm this scenario and point to the prominent role of field ionization by strong internal fields. The latter leads to the fast formation of a core-shell system with an almost static core of screened ions while the outer shell explodes. Substituting the shell ions with a different material such as helium as a sacrificial layer leads to a substantial improvement of the diffraction image for the embedded cluster thus reducing the consequences of radiation damage for coherent diffractive imaging.,Human
"Directed acyclic graphs are a fundamental class of networks that includes citation networks, food webs, and family trees, among others. Here we define a random graph model for directed acyclic graphs and give solutions for a number of the model's properties, including connection probabilities and component sizes, as well as a fast algorithm for simulating the model on a computer. We compare the predictions of the model to a real-world network of citations between physics papers and find surprisingly good agreement, suggesting that the structure of the real network may be quite well described by the random graph.",Human
"We report the observation of a Fano resonance between continuum Mie scattering and a narrow Bragg band in synthetic opal photonic crystals. The resonance leads to a transmission spectrum exhibiting a Bragg dip with an asymmetric profile, which can be tunably reversed to a Bragg rise. The Fano asymmetry parameter is linked with the dielectric contrast between the permittivity of the filler and the specific value determined by the opal matrix. The existence of the Fano resonance is directly related to disorder due to non-uniformity of a-SiO2 opal spheres. Proposed theoretical ""quasi-3D"" model produces results in excellent agreement with the experimental data.",Human
"Some statistical properties of a network of two-Chinese-character compound words in Japanese language are reported. In this network, a node represents a Chinese character and an edge represents a two-Chinese-character compound word. It is found that this network has properties of ""small-world"" and ""scale-free."" A network formed by only Chinese characters for common use ({\it joyo-kanji} in Japanese), which is regarded as a subclass of the original network, also has small-world property. However, a degree distribution of the network exhibits no clear power law. In order to reproduce disappearance of the power-law property, a model for a selecting process of the Chinese characters for common use is proposed.",Human
"We give an alternative description of the new data produced in the KamLAND experiment, assuming the existence of a natural nuclear reactor on the boundary of the liquid and solid phases of the Earth's core. Analyzing the uncertainty of antineutrino spectrum of georeactor origin, we show that the theoretical (which takes into account the soliton-like nuclear georeactor with power about 20 TW) reactor antineutrino spectrum describes with good accuracy the new experimental KamLAND-data. At the same time the parameters of mixing calculated within the framework of georeactor hypothesis are substantially closer to the data of solar flux SNO-experiment then the parameters of mixing obtained in KamLAND-experiment.",Human
"The generalizations of instantaneous frequency and instantaneous bandwidth to a bivariate signal are derived. These are uniquely defined whether the signal is represented as a pair of real-valued signals, or as one analytic and one anti-analytic signal. A nonstationary but oscillatory bivariate signal has a natural representation as an ellipse whose properties evolve in time, and this representation provides a simple geometric interpretation for the bivariate instantaneous moments. The bivariate bandwidth is shown to consist of three terms measuring the degree of instability of the time-varying ellipse: amplitude modulation with fixed eccentricity, eccentricity modulation, and orientation modulation or precession. An application to the analysis of data from a free-drifting oceanographic float is presented and discussed.",Human
"Using a three-dimensional quasiclassical technique we explore the double ionization pathways of a diatomic molecule driven by an intense infrared (800nm) ultrashort laser pulse. For intensities corresponding to the tunneling regime, we find that the three main ionization mechanisms have distinct traces when considering the sum of the momenta parallel to the laser field as a function of the inter-electronic angle of escape. In addition, we find that the previously observed ""finger-like"" structure in the correlated momenta of the strongly driven He is also present for strongly driven diatomic molecules. We show that it is mainly due to the strong interaction, backscattering, the recolliding electron undergoes from the remaining core.",Human
"The problem of linear stability of confined V-flames with arbitrary gas expansion is addressed. Using the on-shell description of flame dynamics, a general equation governing propagation of disturbances of an anchored flame is obtained. This equation is solved analytically for V-flames in high-velocity channel streams. It is demonstrated that dynamics of flame disturbances in this case is controlled by the memory effects associated with vorticity generated by the curved front. The perturbation growth rate spectrum is determined, and explicit analytic expressions for the eigenfunctions are given. It is found that the piecewise linear V-structure is unstable for all values of the gas expansion coefficient.",Human
"We extend the Runge-Gross theorem for a very general class of Markovian and non-Markovian open quantum systems under weak assumptions about the nature of the bath and its coupling to the system. We show that for Kohn-Sham (KS) Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory, it is possible to rigorously include the effects of the environment within a bath functional in the KS potential, thus placing the interactions between the particles of the system and the coupling to the environment on the same footing. A Markovian bath functional inspired by the theory of nonlinear Schrodinger equations is suggested, which can be readily implemented in currently existing real-time codes. Finally, calculations on a helium model system are presented.",Human
"Tricritical points separate continuous and discontinuous symmetry breaking transitions. They occur in a variety of physical systems and their mathematical models. A tricritical point is used to determine a liquid-solid phase transition line in the pressure-temperature plane [Aitta, J. Stat. Mech., 2006]. Excellent experimental agreement has been obtained for iron, the material having the most high pressure data. This allows extrapolation to much higher pressures and temperatures than available experimentally. One can predict the temperature at the liquid-solid boundary in the core of the Earth where the pressure is 329 GPa. Light matter, present as impurities in the core fluid, is found to generate about a 600 K reduction of this temperature.",Human
"We discuss multiscale simulations of long biopolymer translocation through wide nanopores that can accommodate multiple polymer strands. The simulations provide clear evidence of folding quantization, namely, the translocation proceeds through multi-folded configurations characterized by a well-defined integer number of folds. As a consequence, the translocation time acquires a dependence on the average folding number, which results in a deviation from the single-exponent power-law characterizing single-file translocation through narrow pores. The mechanism of folding quantization allows polymers above a threshold length (approximately $1,000$ persistence lengths for double-stranded DNA) to exhibit cooperative behavior and as a result to translocate noticeably faster.",Human
"We investigate exceptional points, which are branch point singularities of two resonance eigenstates, in spectra of the hydrogen atom in crossed external electric and magnetic fields. A procedure to systematically search for exceptional points is presented, and their existence is proven. The properties of the branch point singularities are discussed with effective low-dimensional matrix models, their relation with avoided level crossings is analyzed, and their influence on dipole matrix elements and the photoionization cross section is investigated. Furthermore, the rare case of a connection between three resonances almost forming a triple-degeneracy in the form of a cubic root branch point is discussed.",Human
"We study the properties of the Fraunhofer diffraction patterns produced by Gaussian beams crossing spiral phase plates. We show, both analytically and numerically, that off-axis displacements of the input beam produce asymmetric diffraction patterns. The intensity profile along the direction of maximum asymmetry shows two different peaks. We find that the intensity ratio between these two peaks decreases exponentially with the off-axis displacement of the incident beam, the decay being steeper for higher strengths of the optical singularity of the spiral phase plate. We analyze how this intensity ratio can be used to measure small misalignments of the input beam with a very high precision.",Human
"We present a new pseudospectral algorithm for the calculation of the structure of atoms in strong magnetic fields. We have verified this technique for one, two and three-electron atoms in zero magnetic fields against laboratory results and find typically better than one-percent accuracy. We further verify this technique against the state-of-the-art calculations of hydrogen, helium and lithium in strong magnetic fields (up to about $2\times 10^{6}$ T) and find a similar level of agreement. The key enabling advantages of the algorithm are its simplicity (about 130 lines of commented code) and its speed (about $10^2-10^5$ times faster than finite-element methods to achieve similar accuracy).",Human
"In this paper a model for partial melts is constructed using two-scale homogenization theory. While this technique is well known to the mathematics and materials communities, it is relatively novel to problems in the solid Earth. This approach begins with a grain scale model of the medium, coarsening it into a macroscopic one. The emergent model is in good agreement with previous work, including D. McKenzie's, and serves as verification. This methodology also yields a series of Stokes problems whose solutions provide constitutive relations for permeability and viscosity. A numerical investigation of these relations appears in a companion paper.",Human
"The hyperfine induced $2s2p ^3P_0, ^3P_2 \to 2s^2 ^1S_0$ E1 transition probabilities of Be-like ions were calculated using grasp2K based on multi-configuration Dirac-Fock method and HFST packages. It was found that the hyperfine quenching rates are strongly affected by the interference for low-Z Be-like ions, especially for $2s2p ^3P_0 \to 2s^2 ^1S_0$ transition. In particular, the trends of interference effects with atomic number $Z$ in such two transitions are not monotone. The strongest interference effect occurs near Z=7 for $2s2p ^3P_0 \to 2s^2 ^1S_0$ E1 transition, and near Z=9 for $2s2p ^3P_2 \to 2s^2 ^1S_0$ E1 transition.",Human
"Interval analysis, when applied to the so called problem of experimental data fitting, appears to be still in its infancy. Sometimes, partly because of the unrivaled reliability of interval methods, we do not obtain any results at all. Worse yet, if this happens, then we are left in the state of complete ignorance concerning the unknown parameters of interest. This is in sharp contrast with widespread statistical methods of data analysis. In this paper I show the connections between those two approaches: how to process experimental data rigorously, using interval methods, and present the final results either as intervals (guaranteed, rigorous results) or in a more familiar probabilistic form: as a mean value and its standard deviation.",Human
"In a companion paper, equations for partially molten media were derived using two-scale homogenization theory. One advantage of homogenization is that material properties, such as permeability and viscosity, readily emerge. A caveat is that the dependence of these parameters upon the microstructure is not self-evident. In particular, one seeks to relate them to the porosity. In this paper, we numerically solve ensembles of the cell problems from which these quantities emerge. Using this data, we estimate relationships between the parameters and the porosity. In particular, the bulk viscosity appears to be inversely proportional to the porosity. Finally, we synthesize these numerical estimates with the models. Our hybrid numerical--analytical model predicts that the compaction length vanishes with porosity.",Human
"We have successfully built and operated a source deployment system for the KamLAND detector. This system was used to position radioactive sources throughout the delicate 1-kton liquid scintillator volume, while meeting stringent material cleanliness, material compatibility, and safety requirements. The calibration data obtained with this device were used to fully characterize detector position and energy reconstruction biases. As a result, the uncertainty in the size of the detector fiducial volume was reduced by a factor of two. Prior to calibration with this system, the fiducial volume was the largest source of systematic uncertainty in measuring the number of anti-neutrinos detected by KamLAND. This paper describes the design, operation and performance of this unique calibration system.",Human
"This is the written version of a talk given in memory of Gunnar K\""{a}ll\'{e}n, at the Departments of Theoretical Physics, Physics, and Astronomy of Lund University on February 13, 2009. It will be published in a collection of the papers of Gunnar K\""{a}ll\'{e}n, edited by C. Jarlskog and A. C. T. Wu. I discuss some of K\""{a}ll\'{e}n's work, especially regarding the problem of infinities in quantum field theory, and recount my own interactions with him. In addition, I describe for non-specialists the current status of the problem, and present my personal view on how it may be resolved in the future.",Human
"We prove that the matrix of capacitance in electrostatics is a positive-singular matrix with a non-degenerate null eigenvalue. We explore the physical implications of this fact, and study the physical meaning of the eigenvalue problem for such a matrix. Many properties are easily visualized by constructing a ""potential space"" isomorphic to the euclidean space. The problem of minimizing the internal energy of a system of conductors under constraints is considered, and an equivalent capacitance for an arbitrary number of conductors is obtained. Moreover, some properties of systems of conductors in successive embedding are examined. Finally, we discuss some issues concerning the gauge invariance of the formulation.",Human
"The Markovian diffusion theory is generalized within the framework of the special theory of relativity using a modification of the mathematical calculus of diffusion on Riemannian manifolds (with definite metric) to describe diffusion on Lorentzian manifolds with an indefinite metric. A generalized Langevin equation in the fiber space of position, velocity and orthonormal velocity frames is defined from which the generalized relativistic Kramers equation in the phase space in external force fields is derived. The obtained diffusion equation is invariant under Lorentz transformations and its stationary solution is given by the J\""{u}ttner distribution. Besides a non-stationary analytical solution is derived for the example of force-free relativistic diffusion.",Human
"The efficiency of traffic flows in urban areas is known to crucially depend on signal operation. Here, elements of signal control are discussed, based on the minimization of overall travel times or vehicle queues. Interestingly, we find different operation regimes, some of which involve a ""slower-is-faster effect"", where a delayed switching reduces the average travel times. These operation regimes characterize different ways of organizing traffic flows in urban road networks. Besides the optimize-one-phase approach, we discuss the procedure and advantages of optimizing multiple phases as well. To improve the service of vehicle platoons and support the self-organization of ""green waves"", it is proposed to consider the price of stopping newly arriving vehicles.",Human
"The key characteristic of an optical mode in a microcavity is its quality factor describing the optical losses. The numerical computation of this quantity can be very demanding for present-day devices. Here we show for a certain class of whispering-gallery cavities that the quality factor is related to dynamical tunneling, a phenomenon studied in the field of quantum chaos. We extend a recently developed approach for determining dynamical tunneling rates to open cavities. This allows us to derive an analytical formula for the quality factor which is in very good agreement with full solutions of Maxwell's equations.",Human
"We study the humanitarian response to the destruction brought by the tsunami generated by the Sumatra earthquake of December 26, 2004, as measured by donations, and find that it decays in time as a power law ~ 1/t^(alpha) with alpha=2.5 +/- 0.1. This behavior is suggested to be the rare outcome of a priority queuing process in which individuals execute tasks at a rate slightly faster than the rate at which new tasks arise. We believe this to be the first empirical evidence documenting this recently predicted regime, and provide additional independent evidence that suggests it arises as a result of the intense focus placed on this donation ""task"" by the media.",Human
"The FLASH L-band (1.3 GHz) superconducting accelerator facility at DESY has a Low Level RF (LLRF) system that is similar to that envisioned for ILC. This system has extensive monitoring capability and was used to gather performance data relevant to ILC. In particular, waveform data were recorded with beam off for three, 8-cavity cryomodules to evaluate the input rf stability, perturbations to the SC cavity frequencies and the rf overhead required to achieve constant gradient during the 800 microseconds pulses. In this paper, we discuss the measurements and data analysis procedures and present key findings on the pulse-to-pulse input rf and cavity field stability.",Human
"We experimentally verified the phenomena of photonic jets generated by plane-electromagnetic-wave-illuminated dielectric micro-cylinders with diameter comparable to the corresponding wavelength at microwave frequencies. Using a home-made 2D spatial field mapping system, we carried out a point-by-point measurement of both phase and intensity of spatial electric field distribution inside and around scattering cylinders, providing a clear complete electromagnetic field picture for these phenomena. Correspondingly, the theoretically predicted super-enhancement of the backscattering induced by small particles of deeply-subwavelength size located within the photonic jets was also confirmed. Our measurements agreed well with the numerical simulations, indicating that the photonic jets indeed can provide a promising powerful way for deeply subwavelength detection and imaging.",Human
"The use of hyperasymptotics and the Weniger transformation has been proposed, in a joint fashion, for decoding the divergent asymptotic series generated by the steepest descent on a wide class of saddle-point integrals {evaluated across Stokes sets} [R. Borghi, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 78,} 026703 (2008)]. In the present sequel, the full development of the H-WT up to the second order in H is derived. Numerical experiments, carried out on several classes of saddle-point integrals, including the swallowtail diffraction catastrophe, show the effectiveness of the 2nd-level H-WT, in particular when the integrals are evaluated beyond the asymptotic realm.",Human
"A thin liquid film covered with an insoluble surfactant in the vicinity of a first-order phase transition is discussed. Within the lubrication approximation we derive two coupled equations to describe the height profile of the film and the surfactant density. Thermodynamics of the surfactant is incorporated via a Cahn-Hilliard type free-energy functional which can be chosen to describe a transition between two stable phases of different surfactant density. Within this model, a linear stability analysis of stationary homogeneous solutions is performed, and drop formation in a film covered with surfactant in the lower density phase is investigated numerically in one and two spatial dimensions.",Human
We calculate the inelastic scattering probabilities in the wide band limit of a local polaron model with quadratic coupling to bosons. The central object is a two-particle Green function which is calculated exactly using a purely algebraic approach. Compared with the usual linear interaction term a quadratic interaction term gives higher probabilities for inelastic scattering involving a large number of bosons. As an application we consider the problem hot electron mediated energy transfer at surfaces and use the delta self-consistent field extension of density functional theory to calculate and compare coupling parameters and probabilities for exciting different vibrational modes of CO adsorbed on a Cu(100) surface.,Human
"The 7.6 eV electromagnetic transition between the nearly degenerate ground state and first excited state in the Th-229 nucleus may be very sensitive to potential changes in the fine-structure constant, $\alpha = e^2/\hbar c$. However, the sensitivity is not known, and nuclear calculations are currently unable to determine it. We propose measurements of the differences of atomic transition frequencies between thorium atoms (or ions) with the nucleus in the ground state and in the first excited (isomeric) state. This will enable extraction of the change in nuclear charge radius and electric quadrupole moment between the isomers, and hence the $\alpha$-dependence of the isomeric transition frequency with reasonable accuracy.",Human
We review the geometrical-optics evolution of an electromagnetic wave propagating along a curved ray trajectory in a gradient-index dielectric medium. A Coriolis-type term appears in Maxwell equations under transition to the rotating coordinate system accompanying the ray. This term describes the spin-orbit coupling of light which consists of (i) the Berry phase responsible for a trajectory-dependent polarization variations and (ii) the spin Hall effect representing polarization-dependent trajectory perturbations. These mutual phenomena are described within universal geometrical structures underlying the problem and are explained by the dynamics of the intrinsic angular momentum carried by the wave. Such close geometro-dynamical interrelations illuminate a dual physical nature of the phenomena.,Human
"Light transmission through bilayered thin metal films perforated with subwavelength hole arrays are numerically studied based on a full-vector finite-difference time-domain approach. A variety of transmission peaks originating from different physical mechanisms are observed. In addition to the direct tunnelling and Fabry-P\`{e}rot resonances, generally possessed by idealized bilayered dielectric slabs, the near-field localized plasmon polaritons also play important roles. They not only influence the direct tunnelling in a destructive or constructive way, the interactions between these localized plasmon polaritons on different metal films also result in additional channels which transfer optical energy effectively.",Human
"In this paper, we use a partition of the links of a network in order to uncover its community structure. This approach allows for communities to overlap at nodes, so that nodes may be in more than one community. We do this by making a node partition of the line graph of the original network. In this way we show that any algorithm which produces a partition of nodes can be used to produce a partition of links. We discuss the role of the degree heterogeneity and propose a weighted version of the line graph in order to account for this.",Human
"Schroedinger's first proposal for the interpretation of quantum mechanics was based on a postulate relating the wave function on configuration space to charge density in physical space. Schroedinger apparently later thought that his proposal was empirically wrong. We argue here that this is not the case, at least for a very similar proposal with charge density replaced by mass density. We argue that when analyzed carefully this theory is seen to be an empirically adequate many-worlds theory and not an empirically inadequate theory describing a single world. Moreover, this formulation--Schroedinger's first quantum theory--can be regarded as a formulation of the many-worlds view of quantum mechanics that is ontologically clearer than Everett's.",Human
"Strong electrostatic turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas is characterized by trapping or eddying of particle trajectories produced by the $E\times B$ stochastic drift. Trapping is shown to produce strong effects on test particles and on test modes. It determines non-standard statistics of trajectories: non-Gaussian distribution, memory effects and coherence. Trapped trajectories form quasi-coherent structure. Trajectory trapping has strong nonlinear effects on the test modes on turbulent plasmas. We determine the growth rate of drift modes as function of the statistical characteristics of the background turbulence. We show that trapping provides the physical mechanism for the inverse cascade observed in drift turbulence and for the zonal flow generation.",Human
"Invariance properties of a physical system govern its behavior: energy conservation in turbulence drives a wide distribution of energy among modes, as observed in geophysics, astrophysics and engineering. In hydrodynamic turbulence, the role of helicity (which measures departures from mirror symmetry) remains unclear since it does not alter this distribution. However, the interplay of rotation and helicity leads to significant differences. Using numerical simulations we show the occurence of long-lived laminar cyclonic vortices together with turbulent vortices, reminiscent of recent tornado observations. Furthermore, the small scales are completely self-similar with no deviations from Gaussianity. This result points to the discovery of a small parameter in rotating helical turbulence.",Human
"We show that the mass intervals among the pentaquark baryons $\Theta^{+}$, $N^{*}(1685)$ and $\Xi_{3/2}^{-}$ proposed to be the members of the SU(3) antidecuplet are exact integral multiples of the mass difference between a neutral pion and a muon i.e. 29.318 MeV, in agreement with the general tendency of the mass differences among elementary particles to be close integral/half integral multiple of this mass unit. Further our study reveals that the strength of the SU(3) breaking understood to give members of the same multiplet different masses takes values, discrete as integral multiple of the mass difference between a neutral pion and a muon, the first two massive elementary particles.",Human
"Finding the optimal assignment in budget-constrained auctions is a combinatorial optimization problem with many important applications, a notable example being the sale of advertisement space by search engines (in this context the problem is often referred to as the off-line AdWords problem). Based on the cavity method of statistical mechanics, we introduce a message passing algorithm that is capable of solving efficiently random instances of the problem extracted from a natural distribution, and we derive from its properties the phase diagram of the problem. As the control parameter (average value of the budgets) is varied, we find two phase transitions delimiting a region in which long-range correlations arise.",Human
"Spin-exchange relaxation free alkali-metal magnetometers typically operate in the regime of high optical density, presenting challenges for simple and efficient optical pumping and detection. We describe a high-sensitivity Rb magnetometer using a single elliptically-polarized off-resonant laser beam. Circular component of the light creates relatively uniform spin polarization while the linear component is used to measure optical rotation generated by the atoms. Modulation of the atomic spin direction with an oscillating magnetic field shifts the detected signal to high frequencies. Using a fiber-coupled DFB laser we achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 7 fT/$\sqrt{% \mathrm{Hz}}$ with a miniature $5\times5\times5$ mm Rb vapor cell.",Human
"We report large scale determinant Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the effective bandwidth, momentum distribution, and magnetic correlations of the square lattice fermion Hubbard Hamiltonian at half-filling. The sharp Fermi surface of the non-interacting limit is significantly broadened by the electronic correlations, but retains signatures of the approach to the edges of the first Brillouin zone as the density increases. Finite size scaling of simulations on large lattices allows us to extract the interaction dependence of the antiferromagnetic order parameter, exhibiting its evolution from weak coupling to the strong coupling Heisenberg limit. Our lattices provide improved resolution of the Green's function in momentum space, allowing a more quantitative comparison with time-of-flight optical lattice experiments.",Human
"Bohr's model agreed with the hydrogen spectrum results, but did not agree with the spectrum of Helium. Here we show that Bohr's model-based methods can calculate the experimental value (-79.005 eV) of Helium ground state energy correctly. we suppose the orbital planes of the two electrons are perpendicular to each other. By a computational method, we calculate the Coulomb force among the particles, and the number of de Broglie's waves contained in the short segment at short time intervals. Our results demonstrate that two electrons of Helium are actually moving around, not as electron clouds.",Human
"We show that heterogeneous degree distributions in observed scale-free topologies of complex networks can emerge as a consequence of the exponential expansion of hidden hyperbolic space. Fermi-Dirac statistics provides a physical interpretation of hyperbolic distances as energies of links. The hidden space curvature affects the heterogeneity of the degree distribution, while clustering is a function of temperature. We embed the Internet into the hyperbolic plane, and find a remarkable congruency between the embedding and our hyperbolic model. Besides proving our model realistic, this embedding may be used for routing with only local information, which holds significant promise for improving the performance of Internet routing.",Human
"We present analytical solutions for the evolution of collective states of N atoms. On the one hand is a (timed) Dicke state prepared by absorption of a single photon and exhibiting superradiant decay. This is in strong contrast to evolution of a symmetric Dicke state which is trapped for large atomic clouds. We show that virtual processes yield a small effect on the evolution of the rapidly decaying timed Dicke state. However, they change the long time dynamics from exponential decay into a power-law behavior which can be observed experimentally. For trapped states virtual processes are much more important and provide new decay channels resulting in a slow decay of the otherwise trapped state.",Human
"We show how to adapt a 0-f self-referencing technique to provide a single shot absolute Carrier Envelope Phase (CEP) measurement by using the CEP reference provided by difference frequency generation (DFG) between the spectral wings of the fundamental pulse. Usually, the beat between the input pulse and the DFG signal then provides feedback with which to stabilize the CEP slip in a pulse train. However, with a simple extension we can get a single shot absolute CEP measurement. Success relies on having well characterized input pulses, and the use of accurate propagation models through the nonlinear crystal -- these enable us to construct a mapping between the experimental measurement and the CEP of the optical pulse.",Human
"The scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave by a spherical particle was solved analytically by Gustav Mie in 1908. The Mie solution is expressed as a series with very many terms thus obscuring the physical interpretations of the results. The purpose of the paper is to try to illustrate this phenomenon within the Ramsauer framework used in atomic and nuclear physics. We show that although the approximations are numerous, the Ramsauer analytical formulae describe fairly well the differential and the total cross sections. This allows us to propose an explanation for the origin of the different structures in the total cross section.",Human
"This letter addresses the problem of modeling the highway systems of different countries by using complex networks formalism. More specifically, we compare two traditional geographical models with a modified geometrical network model where paths, rather than edges, are incorporated at each step between the origin and destination nodes. Optimal configurations of parameters are obtained for each model and used in the comparison. The highway networks of Brazil, the US and England are considered and shown to be properly modeled by the modified geographical model. The Brazilian highway network yielded small deviations that are potentially accountable by specific developing and sociogeographic features of that country.",Human
"We describe a fully-automatic 3D-segmentation technique for brain MR images. Using Markov random fields the segmentation algorithm captures three important MR features, i.e. non-parametric distributions of tissue intensities, neighborhood correlations and signal inhomogeneities. Detailed simulations and real MR images demonstrate the performance of the segmentation algorithm. The impact of noise, inhomogeneity, smoothing and structure thickness is analyzed quantitatively. Even single echo MR images are well classified into gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, scalp-bone and background. A simulated annealing and an iterated conditional modes implementation are presented.   Keywords: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Segmentation, Markov Random Fields",Human
"The collisions between linear polar molecules, trapped in a microwave field with circular polarization, are theoretically analyzed. The microwave trap suggested by DeMille \cite{DeMille} seems to be rather advantageous in comparison with other traps. Here we have demonstrated that the microwave trap can provide a successful evaporative cooling for polar molecules in a rather broad range of frequencies of the AC-field. We suggested that not only ground state polar molecules but also molecules in some other states can be safely trapped.   But the state in which molecules can be safely loaded and trapped depends on the frequency of the AC-field.",Human
"To elucidate the influence of shear flow on the generation of magnetic field (the dynamo effect), we study the kinematic limit where the magnetic field does not backreact on the velocity field. By non-perturbatively incorporating the effect of shear in a helically forced turbulence, we show that turbulence intensity and turbulent transport coefficients (turbulent viscosity, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effect) are enhanced by a weak shear while strongly suppressed for strong shear. In particular, $\beta$ is shown to be much more strongly suppressed than $\alpha$ effect. We discuss its important implications for dynamo efficiency, i.e. on the scaling of the dynamo number with differential rotation.",Human
"We present a novel buckling instability relevant to membrane budding in eukaryotic cells. In this mechanism, curved filaments bind to a lipid bilayer without changing its intrinsic curvature. As more and more filaments adsorb, newly added ones are more and more strained, which destabilizes the flat membrane. We perform a linear stability analysis of filament-dressed membranes and find that the buckling threshold is within reasonable in vivo parameter values. We account for the formation of long tubes previously observed in cells and in purified systems. We study strongly deformed dressed membranes and their bifurcation diagram numerically. Our mechanism could be validated by a simple experiment.",Human
"Astronomers in the early 17th century misunderstood the images of stars that they saw in their telescopes. For this reason, the data a skilled observer of that time acquired via telescopic observation of the heavens appeared to support a geocentric Tychonic (or semi-Tychonic) world system, and not a heliocentric Copernican world system. Galileo Galilei made steps in the direction of letting observations lead him towards a Tychonic or semi-Tychonic world system. However, he ultimately backed the Copernican system, against the data he had on hand. By contrast, the German astronomer Simon Marius understood that data acquired by telescopic observation supported a Tychonic world system.",Human
"We present a formalism for rigorous calculations of cross sections for inelastic and reactive collisions of ultracold atoms and molecules confined by laser fields in quasi-2D geometry. Our results show that the elastic-to-inelastic ratios of collision cross sections are enhanced in the presence of a laser confinement and that the threshold energy dependence of the collision cross sections can be tuned by varying the confinement strength and external magnetic fields. The enhancement of the elastic-to-inelastic ratios is inversely proportional to $\sqrt{\epsilon/\hbar \omega_0}$, where $\epsilon$ is the kinetic energy and $\omega_0$ is the oscillation frequency of the trapped particles in the confinement potential.",Human
"We propose an approach for studying quantum information and performing high resolution spectroscopy of rotational states of trapped molecular ions using an on-chip superconducting microwave resonator. Molecular ions have several advantages over neutral molecules. Ions can be loaded into deep (1 eV) RF traps and are trapped independent of the electric dipole moment of their rotational transition. Their charge protects them from motional dephasing and prevents collisional loss, allowing 1 s coherence times when used as a quantum memory, with detection of single molecules possible in <10 ms. An analysis of the detection efficiency and coherence properties of the molecules is presented.",Human
"Using multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations we study ion acceleration from a foil irradiated by a circularly polarized laser pulse at 1022W/cm^2 intensity. When the foil is shaped initially in the transverse direction to match the laser intensity profile, the center part of the target can be uniformly accelerated for a longer time compared to a usual flat target. Target deformation and undesirable plasma heating are effectively suppressed. The final energy spectrum of the accelerated ion beam is improved dramatically. Collimated GeV quasi-mono-energetic ion beams carrying as much as 18% of the laser energy are observed in multi-dimensional simulations. Radiation damping effects are also checked in the simulations.",Human
"We present a concrete picture of spoof surface plasmons (SSPs) combined with cavity resonance to clarify the basic mechanism underlying extraordinary light transmission through metal films with subwavelength slits or holes. This picture may indicate a general mechanism of metallic nanostructure optics: When light is incident on a non-planar conducting surface, the free electrons cannot move homogeneously in response to the incident electric field, i.e., their movement can be impeded at the rough parts, forming inhomogeneous charge distributions. The oscillating charges/dipoles then emit photons (similar to Thomson scattering of x rays by oscillating electrons), and the interference between the photons may give rise to anomalous transmission, reflection or scattering.",Human
"A Fermi-Fermi mixture of 40K and 6Li does not exhibit the Efimov effect in a free space, but the Efimov effect can be induced by confining only 40K in one dimension. Here the Efimov's three-body parameter is controlled by the confinement length. We show that the three-body recombination rate in such a system in the dilute limit has a characteristic logarithmic-periodic dependence on the effective scattering length with the scaling factor 22.0 and can be expressed by formulas similar to those for identical bosons in three dimensions. The ultracold mixture of 40K and 6Li in the 1D-3D mixed dimensions is thus a promising candidate to observe the Efimov physics in fermions.",Human
"A spatial light modulator (SLM) and a pair of galvanometer-mounted mirrors (GMM) were combined into an optical tweezers set-up. This provides great flexibility as the SLM creates an array of traps which can be moved smoothly and quickly with the GMM. To optimise performance, the effect of the incidence angle on the SLM with respect to phase and intensity response was investigated. Although it is common to use the SLM at an incidence angle of 45 degrees, smaller angles give a full 2pi phase shift and an output intensity which is less dependent on the magnitude of the phase shift. The traps were calibrated using an active oscillatory technique and a passive probability distribution method.",Human
"Recently achieved high intensities of short laser pulses open new prospects in their application to hole boring in inhomogeneous overdense plasmas and for ignition in precompressed DT fusion targets. A simple analytical model and numerical simulations demonstrate that pulses with intensities exceeding 1022 W/cm2 may penetrate deeply into the plasma as a result of efficient ponderomotive acceleration of ions in the forward direction. The penetration depth as big as hundreds of microns depends on the laser fluence, which has to exceed a few tens of GJ/cm2. The fast ions, accelerated at the bottom of the channel with an efficiency of more than 20%, show a high directionality and may heat the precompressed target core to fusion conditions.",Human
"A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array has been developed at FBK-irst having 32 channels and a dimension of 8.0 x 1.1 mm^2. Each 250 um wide channel is subdivided into 5 x 22 rectangularly arranged pixels. These sensors are developed to read out a modular high resolution scintillating fiber tracker. Key properties like breakdown voltage, gain and photon detection efficiency (PDE) are found to be homogeneous over all 32 channels of an SiPM array. This could make scintillating fiber trackers with SiPM array readout a promising alternative to available tracker technologies, if noise properties and the PDE are improved.",Human
"We examine the quenching reaction Rb (doublet S) + NH (singlet Delta) goes to Rb (doublet P one-half) + NH (ground triplet Sigma minus). This reaction may be utilized to produce ground state NH molecules for studies of ultracold physics or for other purposes, and is interesting in that it involves initial and final states that are nearly degenerate. This near degeneracy is expected to lead to a large reaction rate. We examine this system using ab initio quantum chemistry calculations and scattering calculations, which include spin-orbit effects, and find that the reaction rate is large and, in fact, approaches the quantum mechanical unitarity limit. We discuss the prospects for an experimental examination of this system.",Human
"We document our Fortran 77 code for multicanonical simulations of 4D U(1) lattice gauge theory in the neighborhood of its phase transition. This includes programs and routines for canonical simulations using biased Metropolis heatbath updating and overrelaxation, determination of multicanonical weights via a Wang-Landau recursion, and multicanonical simulations with fixed weights supplemented by overrelaxation sweeps. Measurements are performed for the action, Polyakov loops and some of their structure factors. Many features of the code transcend the particular application and are expected to be useful for other lattice gauge theory models as well as for systems in statistical physics.",Human
"We offer a solution to a long-standing problem in the physics of networks, the creation of a plausible, solvable model of a network that displays clustering or transitivity -- the propensity for two neighbors of a network node also to be neighbors of one another. We show how standard random graph models can be generalized to incorporate clustering and give exact solutions for various properties of the resulting networks, including sizes of network components, size of the giant component if there is one, position of the phase transition at which the giant component forms, and position of the phase transition for percolation on the network.",Human
"Bloch oscillations (i.e., coherent acceleration of matter waves by an optical lattice) and Bragg diffraction are integrated into light-pulse atom interferometers with large momentum splitting between the interferometer arms, and hence enhanced sensitivity. Simultaneous acceleration of both arms in the same internal states suppresses systematic effects, and simultaneously running a pair of interferometers suppresses the effect of vibrations. Ramsey-Bord\'e interferometers using four such Bloch-Bragg-Bloch (BBB) beam splitters exhibit 15% contrast at 24$\hbar k$ splitting, the largest so far ($\hbar k$ is the photon momentum); single beam splitters achieve 88$\hbar k$. The prospects for reaching 100s of $\hbar k$ and applications like gravitational wave sensors are discussed.",Human
"A parallel dispersive finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for the modeling of three-dimensional (3-D) electromagnetic cloaking structures is presented in this paper. The permittivity and permeability of the cloak are mapped to the Drude dispersion model and taken into account in FDTD simulations using an auxiliary differential equation (ADE) method. It is shown that the correction of numerical material parameters and the slow switching-on of source are necessary to ensure stable and convergent single-frequency simulations. Numerical results from wideband simulations demonstrate that waves passing through a three-dimensional cloak experience considerable delay comparing with the free space propagations, as well as pulse broadening and blue-shift effects.",Human
"We present an elementary method to obtain the equations of the shallow-water solitary waves in different orders of approximation. The first two of these equations are solved to get the shapes and propagation velocities of the corresponding solitary waves. The first-order equation is shown to be equivalent to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, while the second-order equation is solved numerically. The propagation velocity found for the solitary waves of the second-order equation coincides with a known expression, but it is obtained in a simpler way. By measuring the propagation velocity of solitary waves in the laboratory, we demonstrate that the second-order theory gives a considerably improved fit to experimental results.",Human
"Elementary gas-phase reactions of the bimolecular type A + B -> Products are characterized by the second order kinetic law -d[A]/dt=k[A][B], where [A] and [B] are the concentrations of A and B species, t is time and k is the rate constant, usually estimated by means of Eyring equation. Here, we show that its standard derivation, as such, is not consistent with the second order law. This contradiction is however removed by introducing a correlation between what we call ""potentially reactive pairs"". A new derivation of Eyring equation is finally proposed on the basis of the previous findings.",Human
"On the basis of the field concept of gravitation and gravitational analogue of the Faradays induction law the difference of inertial mass of a body at its accelerated movement in horizontal and vertical directions relative to the Earth is shown. For an illustration of such a distinction the results of comparison of a motion of balance mechanical watch at horizontal and vertical orientations of balance axis are given. The expediency of statement of precision mechanical experiments with measurement of anisotropy of the inertial mass is noted, allowing to estimate the validity of the field approach in the description of gravitation.",Human
"It is demonstrated that strong laser pulses can introduce torsional motion in the axially chiral molecule 3,5-diflouro-3',5'-dibromo-biphenyl (DFDBrBPh). A nanosecond laser pulse spatially aligns the stereogenic carbon-carbon (C-C) bond axis allowing a perpendicularly polarized, intense femtosecond pulse to initiate torsional motion accompanied by a rotation about the fixed axis. We monitor the induced motion by femtosecond time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging. Our theoretical analysis corroborates the experimental findings and on the basis of these results we discuss future applications of laser induced torsion, viz., time-resolved studies of de-racemization and laser controlled molecular junctions based on molecules with torsion.",Human
"In this pedagogical work we point out a subtle mistake that can be done by undergraduate or graduate students in the computation of the electrostatic energy of a system containing charges and perfect conductors if they naively use the image method. Specifically, we show that the naive expressions for the electrostatic energy for these systems obtained directly from the image method are wrong by a factor 1/2. We start our discussion with well known examples, namely, point charge-perfectly conducting wall and point charge-perfectly conducting sphere and then proceed to the demonstration of general results, valid for conductors of arbitrary shapes.",Human
"Freak waves, or rogue waves, are one of the fascinating manifestations of the strength of nature. These devastating walls of water appear from nowhere, are short-lived and extremely rare. Despite the large amount of research activities on this subject, neither the minimum ingredients required for their generation nor the mechanisms explaining their formation have been given. Today, it is possible to reproduce such kind of waves in optical fibre systems. In this context, we demonstrate theoretically and numerically that convective instability is the basic ingredient for the formation of rogue waves. This explains why rogues waves are extremely sensitive to noisy environments.",Human
"We present a method, based on a non-Markovian Langevin equation, to include quantum corrections to the classical dynamics of ions in a quasi-harmonic system. By properly fitting the correlation function of the noise, one can vary the fluctuations in positions and momenta as a function of the vibrational frequency, and fit them so as to reproduce the quantum-mechanical behavior, with minimal a priori knowledge of the details of the system. We discuss the application of the thermostat to diamond and to ice Ih. We find that results in agreement with path-integral molecular dynamics can be obtained using only a fraction of the computational effort.",Human
"The collective behavior in a variant of Schelling's segregation model is characterized with methods borrowed from statistical physics, in a context where their relevance was not conspicuous. A measure of segregation based on cluster geometry is defined and several quantities analogous to those used to describe physical lattice models at equilibrium are introduced. This physical approach allows to distinguish quantitatively several regimes and to characterize the transitions between them, leading to the building of a phase diagram. Some of the transitions evoke empirical sudden ethnic turnovers. We also establish links with 'spin-1' models in physics. Our approach provides generic tools to analyze the dynamics of other socio-economic systems.",Human
"The issue of the thermodynamics of a system of distinguishable particles is discussed in this paper. In constructing the statistical mechanics of distinguishable particles from the definition of Boltzmann entropy, it is found that the entropy is not extensive. The inextensivity leads to the so-called Gibbs paradox in which the mixing entropy of two identical classical gases increases. Lots of literature from different points of view were created to resolve the paradox. In this paper, starting from the Boltzmann entropy, we present the thermodynamics of the system of distinguishable particles. A straightforward way to get the corrected Boltzmann counting is shown. The corrected Boltzmann counting factor can be justified in classical statistical mechanics.",Human
The influence of an underlying current on 3-wave interactions of capillary water waves is studied. The fact that in irrotational flow resonant 3-wave interactions are not possible can be invalidated by the presence of an underlying current of constant non-zero vorticity. We show that: 1) wave trains in flows with constant non-zero vorticity are possible only for two-dimensional flows; 2) only positive constant vorticities can trigger the appearance of three-wave resonances; 3) the number of positive constant vorticities which do trigger a resonance is countable; 4) the magnitude of a positive constant vorticity triggering a resonance can not be too small.,Human
"Experiments by several groups during the past decade have shown that a molten polymer nanofilm subject to a large transverse thermal gradient undergoes spontaneous formation of periodic nanopillar arrays. The prevailing explanation is that coherent reflections of acoustic phonons within the film cause a periodic modulation of the radiation pressure which enhances pillar growth. By exploring a deformational instability of particular relevance to nanofilms, we demonstrate that thermocapillary forces play a crucial role in the formation process. Analytic and numerical predictions show good agreement with the pillar spacings obtained in experiment. Simulations of the interface equation further determine the rate of pillar growth of importance to technological applications.",Human
"In January 2004, the Stardust spacecraft flew through the dust of comet 81P/Wild 2 and captured specks of the cometary dust. On analysis of the comet 81P/Wild 2 samples, it was found that they contain materials found in the coldest and hottest region of the early solar nebula, strongly suggesting 'mixing' on the grandest scale. Here it is suggested that if microorganisms were present in the early solar nebula, as required by the hypothesis of cometary panspermia, then in the light of the Stardust findings, life was already present in the very material that formed the planetary bodies.",Human
"J. E. Hirsch (2005) introduced the h-index to quantify an individual's scientific research output by the largest number h of a scientist's papers, that received at least h citations. This so-called Hirsch index can be easily modified to take multiple co-authorship into account by counting the papers fractionally according to (the inverse of) the number of authors. I have worked out 26 empirical cases of physicists to illustrate the effect of this modification. Although the correlation between the original and the modified Hirsch index is relatively strong, the arrangement of the datasets is significantly different depending on whether they are put into order according to the values of either the original or the modified index.",Human
"Some preliminary thoughts on how to design and develop the DAQ architecture for the Silicon tracking system at the future Linear electron positron collider, are briefly presented here. The proposed structure includes three DAQ levels. The first level is based on a high level processing mix-mode ASIC sitting on the detector. The second level still on the detector is a DSP like interface that will send the processed data to the general DAQ system. Several novel technological aspects are part of this development. The role of the ongoing test beam activities with detector prototypes as training camp is emphasized.",Human
"A method and facilities for delivering payload and people into outer space are presented. This method uses, in general, engines located on a planetary surface. The installation consists of a space apparatus, power drive stations, which include a flywheel accumulator (for storage) of energy, a variable reducer, a powerful homopolar electric generator and electric rails. The drive stations accelerate the apparatus up to hypersonic speed.   The estimations and computations show the possibility of making this project a reality in a short period of time (for payloads which can tolerate high g-forces). The launch will be very cheap at a projected cost of 3 - 5 dollars per pound. The authors developed a theory of this type of the launcher.",Human
"We address the problem of achieving a random laser with a cloud of cold atoms, in which gain and scattering are provided by the same atoms. In this system, the elastic scattering cross-section is related to the complex atomic polarizability. As a consequence, the random laser threshold is expressed as a function of this polarizability, which can be fully determined by spectroscopic measurements. We apply this idea to experimentally evaluate the threshold of a random laser based on Raman gain between non-degenerate Zeeman states and find a critical optical thickness on the order of 200, which is within reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments.",Human
"We show that using the properties of the photon Green's function one can successfully describe the propagation of arbitrary nonclassical optical radiation through structured materials. In contrast to the similar input-output approach, our method is not restricted neither to the spatial homogeneous matter nor to the specific direction of light beam incidence or outcoupling. Several quantum states of light are addressed in detail, such as Fock, Glauber, and different squeezed light states, and their Green functions are given. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how scattering of light at a slab can be described with Poynting's energy flow vector, and how experimental setups can be modeled.",Human
"Two new forms of strongly coupled plasmas will be discussed. They have become possible to create and observe in the laboratory only recently and exhibit a wealth of intriguing complex behavior which can be studied, in many cases for the first time, experimentally. Plasmas, gases of charged particles, are universal in the sense that certain properties of complex behavior do only depend on ratios of characteristic parameters of the plasma, not on the parameters themselves. Therefore, it is of fundamental and far reaching consequence, to be able to create and observe a strongly coupled plasma since its behavior is paradigmatic for an entire class of plasmas.",Human
Supersonic beams of polar molecules are deflected using inhomogeneous electric fields. The quantum-state selectivity of the deflection is used to spatially separate molecules according to their quantum state. A detailed analysis of the deflection and the obtained quantum-state selection is presented. The rotational temperatures of the molecular beams are determined from the spatial beam profiles and are all approximately 1 K. Unprecedented degrees of laser-induced alignment $(<\cos^2\theta_{2D}>=0.972)$ and orientation of iodobenzene molecules are demonstrated when the state-selected samples are used. Such state-selected and oriented molecules provide unique possibilities for many novel experiments in chemistry and physics.,Human
"We propose to achieve super-resolution in far-field imaging by use of dual-dye-doped nanoparticles. The nanoparticles with a diameter of a few nanometers are co-doped with two types of dye molecules, namely, Cy3 and Cy5, at a controllable ratio. Due to the short distances between the dye molecules confined in the nanoparticles, Forster resonant energy transfer can occur between the Cy3 and Cy5 molecules with high efficiency. Therefore, the Cy5 molecules can quench the fluorescence emission from the Cy3 molecules in the outer region of focal spot of the excitation beam, thereby enhancing the resolution of imaging.",Human
"Any future high energy e+e- linear collider aims at precision measurements of Standard Model quantities as well as of new, not yet discovered phenomena. In order to pursue this physics programme, excellent detectors at the interaction region have to be complemented by beam diagnostics of unprecedented precision. This article gives an overview of current plans and issues for polarimeters and energy spectrometers at the International Linear Collider, which have been designed to fulfill the precision goals at a large range of beam energies from 45.6 GeV at the Z pole up to 250 GeV or, as an upgrade, up to 500 GeV.",Human
"The cross section for dissociative recombination of BeH^+ is calculated by solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in the local complex potential approximation. The effects of couplings between resonant states and the Rydberg states converging to the ground state of the ion are studied. The relevant potentials, couplings and autoionization widths are extracted using ab initio electron scattering and structure calculations, followed by a diabatization procedure. The calculated cross sections shows a sizable magnitude at low energy, followed by a high-energy peak centered around 1 eV. The electronic couplings between the neutral states induce oscillations in the cross section. Analytical forms for the cross sections at low collision energies are given.",Human
"A hidden symmetry of the nonlinear wave equation is exploited to analyse the propagation of paraxial and uniform atom-laser beams in time-independent, quadratic and cylindrical potentials varying smoothly along the propagation axis. The quality factor and the paraxial ABCD formalism are generalized to account exactly for mean-field interaction effects in such beams. Using an approach based on moments, these theoretical tools provide a very simple and yet exact picture of the interacting beam profile evolution. Guided atom laser experiments are discussed. This treatment addresses simultaneously optical and atomic beams in a unified manner, exploiting the formal analogy between nonlinear optics and nonlinear paraxial atom optics.",Human
"We study light scattering by spheres made of negative refractive index materials. We demonstrate that scattering efficiency of the light does not always obey the well-known Rayleigh's law $Q_{\rm sca}\sim1/\lambda^4$ for small values of size parameter, but could be wavelength independent $Q_{\rm sca}\sim const$, or even increase with the wavelength as $Q_{\rm sca}\sim\lambda^2$. In addition, it is found that spheres with radius comparable with the input wavelength may exhibit suppression of the scattering in any directions, particularly in forward one. It can be considered as analogues of Brewster's angles for spheres.",Human
"The Gaussian formula and spherical aberrations of the static and relativistic curved mirrors are analyzed using the optical path length (OPL) and Fermat's principle. The geometrical figures generated by the rotation of conic sections about their symmetry axes are considered for the shapes of the mirrors. By comparing the results in static and relativistic cases, it is shown that the focal lengths and the spherical aberration relations of the relativistic mirrors obey the Lorentz contraction. Further analysis of the spherical aberrations for both static and relativistic cases have resulted in the information about the limits for the paraxial approximation, as well as for the minimum speed of the systems to reduce the spherical aberrations.",Human
"The capacitance between arbitrary nodes in perfect infinite networks of identical capacitors is studied. We calculate the capacitance between the origin and the lattice site (l,m)for an infinite linear chain, and for an infinite square network consisting of identical capacitors using the lattice green's function. The asymptotic behavior of the capacitance for an infinite square lattice is investigated for large separation between the origin and the site (l,m). We point out the relation between the capacitance of the lattice and the van Hove singularity of the tight- binding Hamiltonian. This method can be applied to other types of lattice structures.",Human
"In this paper we present a mathematical analysis for a steady-state laminar boundary layer flow, governed by the Ostwald-de Wael power-law model of an incompressible non- Newtonian fluid past a semi-infinite power-law stretched flat plate with uniform free stream velocity. A generalization of the usual Blasius similarity transformation is used to find similarity solutions [1]. Under appropriate assumptions, partial differential equations are transformed into an autonomous third-order nonlinear degenerate ordinary differential equation with boundary conditions. Using a shooting method, we establish the existence of an infinite number of global unbounded solutions. The asymptotic behavior is also discussed. Some properties of those solutions depend on the viscosity power-law index.",Human
"We present a theoretical investigation of the excitation of multiple electrostatic wakefields by the ponderomotive force of a short electromagnetic pulse propagating through a dense plasma. It is found that the inclusion of the quantum statistical pressure and quantum electron tunneling effects can qualitatively change the classical behavior of the wakefield. In addition to the well known plasma oscillation wakefield, with a wavelength of the order of the electron skin depth, which in a dense plasma is of the order of several nanometers, wakefields in dense plasmas with a shorter wavelength are also excited. The wakefields can trap electrons and accelerate them to extremely high energies over nanoscales.",Human
"We simulate the impact of a viscous liquid drop onto a smooth dry solid surface. As in experiments, when ambient air effects are negligible, impact flattens the falling drop without producing a splash. The no-slip boundary condition at the wall produces a boundary layer inside the liquid. Later, the flattening surface of the drop traces out the boundary layer. As a result, the eventual shape of the drop is a ""pancake"" of uniform thickness except at the rim, where surface tension effects are significant. The thickness of the pancake is simply the height where the drop surface first collides with the boundary layer.",Human
"A hallmark of the attention economy is the competition for the attention of others. Thus people persistently upload content to social media sites, hoping for the highly unlikely outcome of topping the charts and reaching a wide audience. And yet, an analysis of the production histories and success dynamics of 10 million videos from \texttt{YouTube} revealed that the more frequently an individual uploads content the less likely it is that it will reach a success threshold. This paradoxical result is further compounded by the fact that the average quality of submissions does increase with the number of uploads, with the likelihood of success less than that of playing a lottery.",Human
"Wavelength scaling law for the yield of high-order harmonic emission is theoretically examined for excited state atoms which are optically prepared by simultaneously exposing to an extreme ultraviolet pulse at the resonant wavelength and an infrared pulse at a variable wavelength in the range of 0.8\mum-2.4\mum. Numerical simulations are performed based on the three-dimensional time-dependent Schrodinger equation (3D TDSE) for Ne and H. We confirm that the harmonic yield follows a \lambda^-{4-6} scaling with the single fundamental driving laser pulse; whereas for the optically prepared excited state atoms, a \lambda^-{2-3} scaling for the harmonic yield is revealed.",Human
Semi-analytical model for calculating acoustic response to a line-focused laser pulse in an optically absorptive isotropic cylinder is proposed and implemented. It is assumed that the laser input is absorbed over the volume and thus creates a radially distributed thermoelastic source. Closed-form solution is obtained in the Fourier domain. Two inverse Fourier transforms in frequency and circumferential wave number yield the sought waveforms of acoustic response in the time-space domain. Numerical simulation is compared to the calculation based on a surface dipole source. The two signals have essentially different shapes of the wave-arrival peaks when the optical penetration is large enough.,Human
The problem concerning the form of the electrostatic field potential of the infinite charged metallic plane contacting with the metallic sphere is solved. The distributions of the surface charge densities both on the plane and the sphere and also the force acting on the sphere that causing to tear away from the plane are found. The expressions found for the charge of the sphere and the force of tear from the plane permits estimate the frequency of the shuttle motion of the nanoparticles and the charge transfer between metallic electrodes and also use them for the measurement of their sizes and to make use of their separation in progress.,Human
"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is applied to the condensation process of supersaturated vapors of methane, ethane, and carbon dioxide. Simulations of systems with up to a million particles were conducted with a massively parallel MD program. This leads to reliable statistics and makes nucleation rates down to the order of 10^30/(m^3 s) accessible to the direct simulation approach. Simulation results are compared to the classical nucleation theory (CNT) as well as the theory of Laaksonen, Ford, and Kulmala (LFK) which introduces a size dependence of the specific surface energy. CNT describes the nucleation of ethane and carbon dioxide excellently over the entire studied temperature range, whereas LFK provides a better approach to methane at low temperatures.",Human
"An optically-dense ionization wave (IW) produced by two femtosecond laser pulses focused cylindrically and crossing each other is shown to be an efficient coherent x-ray converter. The resulting velocity of a quasi-plane IW in the vicinity of pulse intersection increases with the angle between the pulses from the group velocity of ionizing pulses to infinity allowing an easy tuning the wavelength of x-rays. The x-ray spectra of a converted, lower frequency coherent light change from the monochromatic to a high order harmonic-like with the duration of ionizing pulses and the intensity of scattered pulses; the spectrum are not symmetrical at V<c and V>c.",Human
"Though often considered as one of the main driving process of the complexation of species of opposite charges, the release of counterions has never been experimentally directly measured on polyelectrolyte/proteins complexes. We present here the first structural determination of such a release by Small Angle Neutron Scattering in complexes made of lysozyme, a positively charged protein and of PSS, a negatively charged polyelectrolyte. Both components have the same neutron density length, so their scattering can be switched off simultaneously in an appropriate ""matching"" solvent; this enables determination of the spatial distribution of the single counterions within the complexes. The counterions (including the one subjected to Manning condensation) are expelled from the cores where the species are at electrostatic stoichiometry.",Human
"We use the three-cornered-hat method to evaluate the absolute frequency stabilities of three different ultrastable reference cavities, one of which has a vibration-insensitive design that does not even require vibration isolation. An Nd:YAG laser and a diode laser are implemented as light sources. We observe $\sim1$ Hz beat note linewidths between all three cavities. The measurement demonstrates that the vibration-insensitive cavity has a good frequency stability over the entire measurement time from 100 $\mu$s to 200 s. An absolute, correlation-removed Allan deviation of $1.4\times10^{-15}$ at 1 s of this cavity is obtained, giving a frequency uncertainty of only 0.44 Hz.",Human
"The fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the probabilities of physical outcomes are obtained from the intermediate states and processes of the interacting particles, considered as happening concurrently. When the interaction is described by a potential, the total energy of the particle is equal to its total kinetic plus potential energies. We derive the Schrodinger and Dirac equations as the conditions the wavefunction must satisfy at each point in order to fulfill the corresponding energy equation. In our approach quantum theory is tangible, experimentally justified and theoretically consistent.

"InGaAsP/InP quantum wells (QW) ridge waveguide lasers were fabricated for the evaluation of Ga+ Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling of mirrors. Electrical and optical proprieties were investigated. A 7% increment in threshold current, a 17% reduction in external quantum efficiency and 15 nm blue shift in the emission spectrum were observed after milling as compared to the as cleaved facet result. Annealing in inert atmosphere partially revert these effects resulting in 4% increment in threshold current, 11% reduction in external efficiency and 13 nm blue shift with the as cleaved result. The current-voltage behavior after milling and annealing shows a very small increase in leakage current indicating that optical damage is the main effect of the milling process.",Human
"It is proposed that convection driven dynamos operating in planetary cores could be oscillatory even when the oscillations are not directly noticeable from the outside. Examples of dynamo simulations are pointed out that exhibit oscillations in the structure of the azimuthally averaged toroidal magnetic flux while the mean poloidal field shows only variations in its amplitude. In the case of the geomagnetic field, global excursions may be associated with these oscillations. Long period dynamo simulations indicate that the oscillations may cause reversals once in a while. No special attempt has been made to use most realistic parameter values. Nevertheless some similarities between the simulations and the paleomagnetic record can be pointed out.",Human
"We study high-density traffic of information packets on sparse modular networks with scale-free subgraphs. With different statistical measures we distinguish between the free flow and congested regime and point out the role of modules in the jamming transition. We further consider correlations between traffic signals collected at each node in the network. The correlation matrix between pairs of signals reflects the network modularity in the eigenvalue spectrum and the structure of eigenvectors. The internal structure of the modules has an important role in the diffusion dynamics, leading to enhanced correlations between the modular hubs, which can not be filtered out by standard methods. Implications for the analysis of real networks with unknown modular structure are discussed.",Human
"While Special and General Relativity are well known by a very large number of people, Einstein's religious convinctions are almost ignored. The paper focuses on what was his view about immortality. Einstein believed in Spinoza's view of God and in cosmic religion. Since the Special Relativity implies a kind of superdeterminism with the future completely determined,that can be taken as ontological proof for the non-Existence of an hypothetical God. Because of that K.Popper in a private conversation with him said: ""You are Parmenides"". Einstein's Pantheism was in contrast with the non-Euclidean universe of Special Relativity. In conclusion the interest in our times of his Weltanschaung will be taken in consideration.",Human
"The ability to artificially grow in a controllable manner at nanoscale, from modern deposition techniques, complex structural configurations made with metallic, polar and semiconductors materials raises today the issue of the ""best"" achievable inner structure to tailor the near-field properties of a nanostructured medium. In the present work we make a step towards the rational design of these materials by reporting numerical experimentations demonstrating the possibility of identifying structural configurations of layered metallodielectric media specifically designed to control the electromagnetic density of states in the close vicinity of their surface. These results could find broad applications in near-field technologies.",Human
"In this paper, we introduce a scientific format for text-based data files, which facilitates storing and communicating tabular data sets. The so-called Full-Metadata Format builds on the widely used INI-standard and is based on four principles: readable self-documentation, flexible structure, fail-safe compatibility, and searchability. As a consequence, all metadata required to interpret the tabular data are stored in the same file, allowing for the automated generation of publication-ready tables and graphs and the semantic searchability of data file collections. The Full-Metadata Format is introduced on the basis of three comprehensive examples. The complete format and syntax is given in the appendix.",Human
"We present a theoretical study on the energy loss by protons in solid copper. The ab initio shellwise local plasma approximation (SLPA) is employed for the inner-shells, and the Mermin dielectric function for the valence electrons. The partial contribution of each sub-shell of target electrons is calculated separately, including the screening among the electrons of the same binding energy. Present results are obtained using the SLPA and the known Hartree-Fock wave functions for copper. The theoretical curves are compared with the experimental data available and with the semi-empirical srim08 values, showing very good agreement in a large energy region (5 keV-30 MeV).",Human
"A measurement of the hyperfine coefficients and isotope shifts for the Dy I 421.291 nm transition [$4f^{10}6s^2 (J=8)\to4f^{10}6s6p (J=9)$] using atomic beam laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy is presented. A King Plot analysis is performed to determine a specific mass shift of $\delta \nu_{sms}^{164-162}=11(7)$ Hz for the 421-nm transition, confirming the pure $4f^{10}6s6p$ configuration of the excited state. This transition is currently being explored for laser cooling of an atomic beam of dysprosium used in a search for a temporal variation of the fine-structure constant.",Human
"Cremer-Pople puckering coordinates appear to be the natural candidate variables to explore the conformational space of cyclic compounds, and in literature different parametrizations have been used to this end. However, while every parametrization is equivalent in identifying conformations, it is not obvious that they can also act as proper collective variables for the exploration of the puckered conformations free energy surface. It is shown that only the polar parametrization is fit to produce an unbiased estimate of the free energy landscape. As an example, the case of a six-membered ring, glucuronic acid, is presented, showing the artefacts that are generated when a wrong parametrization is used.",Human
"Morphogen profiles play a vital role in biology by specifying position in embryonic development. However, the factors that influence the shape of a morphogen profile remain poorly understood. Since morphogens should provide precise positional information, one significant factor is the robustness of the profile to noise. We compare three classes of morphogen profiles (linear, exponential, algebraic) to see which is most precise when subject to both external embryo-to-embryo fluctuations and internal fluctuations due to intrinsically random processes such as diffusion. We find that both the kinetic parameters and the overall gradient shape (e.g. exponential versus algebraic) can be optimised to generate maximally precise positional information.",Human
"Liquids in contact with solids are submitted to intermolecular forces making liquids heterogeneous and, in a mechanical model, the stress tensor is not any more spherical as in homogeneous bulks. The aim of this article is to show that a square-gradient functional taking into account the volume liquid free energy corrected with two surface liquid density functionals is a mean field approximation allowing to study structures of very thin liquid nanofilms near plane solid walls. The model determines analytically the concept of disjoining pressure for liquid films of thicknesses of a very few number of nanometers and yields a behavior in good agreement with the shapes of experimental curves carried out by Derjaguin and his successors.",Human
"Vector algebra is a powerful and needful tool for Physics but unfortunately, due to lack of mathematical skills, it becomes misleading for first undergraduate courses of science and engineering studies. Standard vector identities are usually proved using Cartesian components or geometrical arguments, accordingly. Instead, this work presents a new teaching strategy in order to derive symbolically vector identities without analytical expansions in components, either explicitly or using indicial notation. This strategy is mainly based on the correspondence between three-dimensional vectors and skew-symmetric second-rank tensors. Hence, the derivations are performed from skew tensors and dyadic products, rather than cross products. Some examples of skew-symmetric tensors in Physics are illustrated.",Human
"We look afresh at the deduction of the ""Lorentz contraction"" of a ""rod"" from the Lorentz transformation equations of the special theory of relativity. We show that under special conditions, which include acceleration of the ""rod"", length ""expansion"" and ""invariance"" are possible, and thus these are purely kinematical phenomena. We then take a closer look at Einstein's two famous papers on the special theory of relativity and point out a flaw in his argument. It seems that it is possible to have the times of the clocks of two, and indeed all, inertial systems to agree with each other.",Human
"We show that the thermodynamic limit of a bistable phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle has a selection rule for the ""more stable"" macroscopic steady state. The analysis is akin to the Maxwell construction. Based on the chemical master equation approach, it is shown that, except at a critical point, bistability disappears in the stochastic model when fluctuation is sufficiently low but unneglectable. Onsager's Gaussian fluctuation theory applies to the unique macroscopic steady state. With initial state in the basin of attraction of the ""less stable"" steady state, the deterministic dynamics obtained by the Law of Mass Action is a metastable phenomenon. Stability and robustness in cell biology are stochastic concepts.",Human
"In this work we show that in a microfluidic network and in low Reynolds numbers a system can be irreversible because of hysteresis effects.The network, which is employed in our simulations, is taken from recent experiments. The network consists of one loop connected to input and output pipes. A train of droplets enter the system at a uniform rate, but they may leave it in different patterns, e.g. periodic or even chaotic. The out put pattern depends on the time interval among the incoming droplets as well as the network geometry and for some parameters the system is not reversible.",Human
"A scheme of evaluating an impact of a given scientific paper based on importance of papers quoting it is investigated. Introducing a weight of a given citation, dependent on the previous scientific achievements of the author of the citing paper, we define the weighting factor of a given scientist. Technically the weighting factors are defined by the components of the normalized leading eigenvector of the matrix describing the citation graph. The weighting factor of a given scientist, reflecting the scientific output of other researchers quoting his work, allows us to define weighted number of citation of a given paper, weighted impact factor of a journal and weighted Hirsch index of an individual scientist or of an entire scientific institution.",Human
"Human motor activities are known to exhibit scale-free long-term correlated fluctuations over a wide range of timescales, from few to thousands of seconds. The fundamental processes originating such fractal-like behavior are not yet understood. To untangle the most significant features of these fluctuations, in this work the problem is oversimplified by studying a much simpler system: the spontaneous motion of rodents, recorded during several days. The analysis of the animal motion reveals a robust scaling comparable with the results previously reported in humans. It is shown that the most relevant features of the experimental results can be replicated by the statistics of the activation-threshold model proposed in another context by Davidsen and Schuster.",Human
The present paper presents the carrier-acoustic phonon scattering in the spherical and TMV viruses. We demonstrate theoretically that the absorption rate changes in spherical and TMV viruses according to the phonon energy while emission of phonon is limited by the hole energy. The obtained relaxation rate is then used to calculate the conductivity and mobility of viruses. The obtained conductivity for spherical and TMV viruses suggest that the TMV virus is more conducting and therefore may be a good candidate for the connector or wire to be used in the nanoelectronics. The value of resistance obtained for TMV virus is lower than the earlier reported resistance of DNA.,Human
"Motivated by the observed coordination of nearby beating cilia, we use a scale model experiment to show that hydrodynamic interactions can cause synchronization between rotating paddles driven at constant torque in a very viscous fluid. Synchronization is only observed when the shafts supporting the paddles have some flexibility. The phase difference in the synchronized state depends on the symmetry of the paddles. We use the method of regularized stokeslets to model the paddles and find excellent agreement with the experimental observations. We also use a simple analytic theory based on far-field approximations to derive scaling laws for the synchronization time as a function of paddle separation.",Human
"Properties of random and fluctuating systems are often studied through the use of Gaussian distributions. However, in a number of situations, rare events have drastic consequences, which can not be explained by Gaussian statistics. Considerable efforts have thus been devoted to the study of non Gaussian fluctuations such as L\'evy statistics, generalizing the standard description of random walks. Unfortunately only macroscopic signatures, obtained by averaging over many random steps, are usually observed in physical systems. We present experimental results investigating the elementary process of anomalous diffusion of photons in hot atomic vapours. We measure the step size distribution of the random walk and show that it follows a power law characteristic of L\'evy flights.",Human
"A computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the identification of lung internal nodules in low-dose multi-detector helical Computed Tomography (CT) images was developed in the framework of the MAGIC-5 project. The three modules of our lung CAD system, a segmentation algorithm for lung internal region identification, a multi-scale dot-enhancement filter for nodule candidate selection and a multi-scale neural technique for false positive finding reduction, are described. The results obtained on a dataset of low-dose and thin-slice CT scans are shown in terms of free response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curves and discussed.",Human
"Protein amyloid fibrils are a form of linear protein aggregates that are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we study the dynamics of amyloid fibril elongation by performing Langevin dynamic simulations on a coarse-grained model of peptides. Our simulation results suggest that the elongation process is dominated by a series of local minimum due to frustration in monomer-fibril interactions. This rugged energy landscape picture indicates that the amount of recycling of monomers at the fibrils' ends before being fibrilized is substantially reduced in comparison to the conventional two-step elongation model. This picture, along with other predictions discussed, can be tested with current experimental techniques.",Human
"We have quantified collisional losses, decoherence and the collision shift in a one-dimensional optical lattice clock with bosonic 88Sr. The lattice clock is referenced to the highly forbidden transition 1S0 - 3P0 at 698 nm, which becomes weakly allowed due to state mixing in a homogeneous magnetic field. We were able to quantify three decoherence coefficients, which are due to dephasing collisions, inelastic collisions between atoms in the upper and lower clock state, and atoms in the upper clock state only. Based on the measured coefficients, we determine the operation parameters at which a 1D-lattice clock with 88Sr shows no degradation due to collisions on the relative accuracy level of 10-16.",Human
"A theoretical interpretation is given for the observed long-distance correlations in potential fluctuations in TJ-II. The value of the correlation increases above the critical point of the transition for the emergence of the plasma edge shear flow layer. Mean (i.e. surface averaged, zero-frequency) sheared flows cannot account for the experimental results. A model consisting of four envelope equations for the fluctuation level, the mean flow shear, the zonal flow amplitude shear, and the averaged pressure gradient is proposed. It is shown that the presence of zonal flows is essential to reproduce the main features of the experimental observations.",Human
"We demonstrate the long-distance transmission of an ultra-stable optical frequency derived directly from a state-of-the-art optical frequency standard. Using an active stabilization system we deliver the frequency via a 146 km long underground fiber link with a fractional instability of 3*10^{-15} at 1 s, which is close to the theoretical limit for our transfer experiment. The relative uncertainty for the transfer is below 1*10^{-19} after 30 000 seconds. Tests with a very short fiber show that noise in our stabilization system contributes fluctuations which are two orders of magnitude lower, namely 3*10^{-17} at 1 s, reaching 10^{-20} after 4000 s.",Human
"We present a new technique to synthesize high-power single-cycle pulses in the visible and ultraviolet ranges by coherent superposition of a multiband octave-spanning spectrum obtained by highly-nondegenerate cascaded four-wave mixing of femtosecond pulses in bulk isotropic nonresonant media. The generation of coherent spectra spanning over two octaves in bandwidth is experimentally demonstrated using a thin fused silica slide. Full characterization of the intervening multicolored fields using frequency-resolved optical gating, where multiple cascaded orders have been measured simultaneously for the first time, supports the possibility of direct synthesis of near-single-cycle 2.2 fs visible-UV pulses without recurring to complex amplitude or phase control, which should enable many applications in science and technology.",Human
"The structure of the basin of attraction of a stable equilibrium point is investigated for a dynamical system (W97) often used to model transition to turbulence in shear flows. The basin boundary contains not only an equilibrium point Xlb but also a periodic orbit P, and it is the latter that mediates the transition. Orbits starting near Xlb relaminarize. We offer evidence that this is due to the extreme narrowness of the region complementary to basin of attraction in that part of phase space near Xlb. This leads to a proposal for interpreting the 'edge of chaos' in terms of more familiar invariant sets.",Human
"We propose a general method to circumvent the singularity of arbitrary 2D cloaks, which arises from infinitely large values of material parameters at inner boundaries. The presented method is based on the deformation view of the transformation design method. It is shown that by adjusting the principle stretch out of the cloaking plane, 2D cloaks of arbitrary shapes without singularity can be constructed. It is also demonstrated that the method based on the equivalent dispersion relation and the design method for nonsingular 2D cloak from mirror-symmetric cross section of 3D cloak can be derived from the proposed theory. Examples of a cylindrical electromagnetic cloak and an arbitrary shaped 2D electromagnetic cloak without singularity are provided to illustrate the method.",Human
"In the context of the search for gasoline surrogates for kinetic modeling purpose, this paper describes a new model for the low-temperature auto-ignition of n-heptane/iso-octane/hexene/toluene blends for the different linear isomers of hexene. The model simulates satisfactory experimental results obtained in a rapid compression machine for temperatures ranging from 650 to 850 K in the case of binary and ternary mixtures including iso octane, 1-hexene and toluene. Predictive simulations have also been performed for the autoignition of n heptane/iso octane/hexene/toluene quaternary mixtures: the predicted reactivity is close to that of pure iso octane with a retarding effect when going from 1- to 3-alkene.",Human
"Inertial effects in nonlinear magnetic reconnection are studied within the context of 2D electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) with resistive and viscous dissipation. Families of nonlinear solutions for relevant current sheet parameters are predicted and confirmed numerically in all regimes of interest. Electron inertia becomes important for current sheet thicknesses $\delta$ below the inertial length $d_{e}$. In this case, in the absence of electron viscosity, the sheet thickness experiences a nonlinear collapse. Viscosity regularizes solutions at small scales. Transition from resistive to viscous regimes shows a nontrivial dependence on resistivity and viscosity, featuring a hysteresis bifurcation. In all accessible regimes, the nonlinear reconnection rate is found to be explicitly independent of the electron inertia and dissipation coefficients.",Human
"Many real-world complex networks contain a significant amount of structural redundancy, in which multiple vertices play identical topological roles. Such redundancy arises naturally from the simple growth processes which form and shape many real-world systems. Since structurally redundant elements may be permuted without altering network structure, redundancy may be formally investigated by examining network automorphism (symmetry) groups. Here, we use a group-theoretic approach to give a complete description of spectral signatures of redundancy in undirected networks. In particular, we describe how a network's automorphism group may be used to directly associate specific eigenvalues and eigenvectors with specific network motifs.",Human
"The ability to render objects invisible using a cloak - not detectable by an external observer - for concealing objects has been a tantalizing goal1-6. Here, we demonstrate a cloak operating in the near infrared at a wavelength of 1550 nm. The cloak conceals a deformation on a flat reflecting surface, under which an object can be hidden. The device has an area of 225 um2 and hides a region of 1.6 um2. It is composed of nanometre size silicon structures with spatially varying densities across the cloak. The density variation is defined using transformation optics to define the effective index distribution of the cloak.",Human
This study focuses on the automatic generation by the software EXGAS of kinetic models for the oxidation of large methyl esters using a single set of kinetic parameters. The obtained models allow to well reproduce the oxidation of n-decane / methyl palmitate mixture in a jet-stirred reactor. This paper also presents the construction and a comparison of models for methyl esters from C7 up to C17 in terms f conversion in a jet-stirred reactor and of ignition delay time in a shock tube. This comparison study showed that methyl esters larger than methyl octanoate behave similarly and have very close reactivities.,Human
"Invisibility or cloaking has captured human's imagination for many years. With the recent advancement of metamaterials, several theoretical proposals show cloaking of objects is possible, however, so far there is a lack of an experimental demonstration at optical frequencies. Here, we report the first experimental realization of a dielectric optical cloak. The cloak is designed using quasi-conformal mapping to conceal an object that is placed under a curved reflecting surface which imitates the reflection of a flat surface. Our cloak consists only of isotropic dielectric materials which enables broadband and low-loss invisibility at a wavelength range of 1400-1800 nm.",Human
"Molecular modelling and simulation as well as four equations of state (EOS) are applied to natural gas mixtures regarding Joule-Thomson (JT) inversion. JT inversion curves are determined by molecular simulation for six different natural gas mixtures consisting of methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and ethane. These components are also regarded as pure fluids, leading to a total of ten studied systems. The results are compared to four advanced mixture EOS: DDMIX, SUPERTRAPP, BACKONE and the recent GERG-2004 Wide-Range Reference EOS. It is found that molecular simulation is competitive with state-of-the-art EOS in predicting JT inversion curves. The molecular based approaches (simulation and BACKONE) are superior to DDMIX and SUERTRAPP.",Human
"We study fluctuations of the number of photocounts measured by an ideal photodetector illuminated by light scattered in an amplifying disordered medium, below the threshold for random lasing. We show that the variance of fluctuations and their correlation function carry information about fluctuating properties of the medium. A direct link is established between the fluctuations of the number of photocounts due to the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and the dimensionless conductance g of the medium. Our results suggest a possibility of probing amplifying disordered media by analyzing statistics of their ASE, without illuminating them from outside by a probe beam.",Human
"A sampling procedure to compute exactly the rate of activated processes arising in systems at equilibrium or nonequilibrium steady state is presented. The procedure is a generalization of the method in [A. Warmflash, P. Bhimalapuram, and A. R. Dinner, J. Chem. Phys., 127, 154112 (2007); A. Dickson, A. Warmflash, and A. R. Dinner, J. Chem. Phys., 130, 074104 (2009)] in which one performs simulations restricted into cells by using a reinjection rule at the boundaries of the cells which is consistent with the exact probability fluxes through these boundaries. Our generalization uses results from transition path theory which indicate how to twist the dynamics to calculate reaction rates.",Human
"It is shown that, in the liquid-filled hollow core of a single-mode photonic crystal fiber, a micron-sized particle can be held stably against a fluidic counter-flow using radiation pressure, and moved to and fro (over 10s of cm) by ramping the laser power up and down. The results represent a major advance over previous work on particle transport in optically multimode liquid-filled fibers, in which the fluctuating transverse field pattern renders the radiation and trapping forces unpredictable. The counter-flowing liquid can be loaded with sequences of chemicals in precisely controlled concentrations and doses, making possible studies of single particles, vesicles or cells.",Human
"The Open Science Grid (OSG) includes work to enable new science, new scientists, and new modalities in support of computationally based research.

"Leon Rosenfeld published in 1930 the first systematic Hamiltonian approach to Lagrangian models that possess a local gauge symmetry. The application of this formalism to theories with local internal symmetries, such as electromagnetism in interaction with charged matter fields, is valid and complete, and predates by two decades the work by Dirac and Bergmann. Although he provided a group-theoretical justification for gauge fixing procedures that had just been implemented in the first expositions of quantum electrodynamics by Heisenberg and Pauli, and also by Fermi, his contribution went largely unnoticed. This lack of impact seems to be related to a generalized disenchantment with second quantization in the 1930's and 1940's.",Human
"The linear inverse source and scattering problems are studied from the perspective of compressed sensing, in particular the idea that sufficient incoherence and sparsity guarantee uniqueness of the solution. By introducing the sensor as well as target ensembles, the maximum number of recoverable targets is proved to be at least proportional to the number of measurement data modulo a log-square factor with overwhelming probability. Important contributions of the analysis include the discoveries of the threshold aperture, consistent with the classical Rayleigh criterion, and the decoherence effect induced by random antenna locations. The prediction of theorems are confirmed by numerical simulations.",Human
"The standard theory of ideal gases ignores the interaction of the gas particles with the thermal radiation (photon gas) that fills the otherwise vacuum space between them. This is an unphysical feature of the theory since every material in this universe, and hence also the particles of a gas, absorbs and radiates thermal energy. The interaction with the thermal radiation that is contained within the volume of the body may be important in gases since the latter, unlike solids and liquids, are capable of undergoing conspicuous volume changes. Taking this interaction into account makes the behaviour of the ideal gases more realistic and removes Gibbs' paradox.",Human
"We numerically demonstrate inhibition of absorption, optical transparency, and anomalous momentum states of phase locked harmonic pulses in semiconductors, at UV and extreme UV frequencies, in spectral regions where the dielectric constant of typical semiconductors is negative. We show that a generated harmonic signal can propagate through a bulk metallic medium without being absorbed as a result of a phase locking mechanism between the pump and its harmonics. These findings may open new regimes in nonlinear optics and are particularly relevant to the emerging fields of nonlinear negative index meta-materials and nano-plasmonics, especially in the ultrafast pulse regime.",Human
"This work reports a theoretical study of the gas phase unimolecular decomposition of cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane by means of quantum chemical calculations. A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each cycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed have been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data (?H\degree f, S\degree, C\degree p) for all the involved species have been obtained by means of isodesmic reactions. Rate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition state theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. These values have been compared with the few data available in the literature and showed a rather good agreement.",Human
"We present an application of the Faraday effect to produce a narrow band atomic filter in an alkali metal vapor. In our experiment two Raman beams separated in frequency by the ground state hyperfine splitting in 87Rb are produced using an EOM and then filtered using the Faraday effect in an isotopically pure 85Rb thermal vapor. An experimental transmission spectra for the filter is presented along with a theoretical calculation. The performance of the filter is then demonstrated and characterized using a Fabry-Perot etalon. For a temperature of 70 degrees and a longitudinal magnetic field of 80 G a suppression to -18 dB is achieved, limited by the quality of the polarizers.",Human
"We report measurements of the isotope shifts of the (3s3p)$^3$P$_{0,1,2}$ - (3s4s)$^3$S$_1$ Mg I transitions for the stable isotopes $^{24}$Mg (I=0), $^{25}$Mg (I=5/2) and $^{26}$Mg (I=0). Furthermore the $^{25}$Mg $^3$S$_1$ hyperfine coefficient A($^3$S$_1$) = (-321.6 $\pm$ 1.5) MHz is extracted and found to be in excellent agreement with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions giving A($^3$S$_1$) = -325 MHz and B($^3$S$_1$) $\simeq 10^{-5}$ MHz. Compared to previous measurements, the data presented in this work is improved up to a factor of ten.",Human
"In practical applications of tomographic imaging, there are often challenges for image reconstruction due to under-sampling and insufficient data. In computed tomography (CT), for example, image reconstruction from few views would enable rapid scanning with a reduced x-ray dose delivered to the patient. Limited-angle problems are also of practical significance in CT. In this work, we develop and investigate an iterative image reconstruction algorithm based on the minimization of the image total variation (TV) that applies to divergent-beam CT. Numerical demonstrations of our TV algorithm are performed with various insufficient data problems in fan-beam CT. The TV algorithm can be generalized to cone-beam CT as well as other tomographic imaging modalities.",Human
"Self diffusion coefficients and binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients were determined by equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with the Green-Kubo method. The study covers five pure fluids: neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and methane and three binary mixtures: argon+krypton, argon+xenon, and krypton+xenon. The fluids are modeled by spherical Lennard-Jones air-potentials, with parameters which were determined solely on the basis of vapor-liquid equilibria data. The predictions of the self diffusion coefficients agree within 5% for gas state points and about 10% for liquid state points. The Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients are predicted within 10%. A test of Darken's model shows good agreement.",Human
"Beam loading is the phenomenon which limits the charge and the beam quality in plasma based accelerators. An experimental study conducted with a laser-plasma accelerator is presented. Beam loading manifests itself through the decrease of the beam energy, the reduction of dark current and the increase of the energy spread for large beam charge. 3D PIC simulations are compared to the experimental results and confirm the effects of beam loading. It is found that, in our experimental conditions, the trapped electron beams generate decelerating fields on the order of 1 GV/m/pC and that beam loading effects are optimized for trapped charges of about 20 pC.",Human
"Electrons colliding with spatially fixed ions in strong laser fields are investigated by solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. Considering first simple one-dimensional model systems, the mechanisms and energy spectra of fast electrons are analyzed, starting from collisions on a single ion. By using these electrons as projectiles for a second and third collision, the maximum possible energy obtained can be significantly increased. We then generalize the analysis to 2D systems where additional angular degrees of freedom lead to a drastic loss of efficiency. This problem can be overcome by introducing external confinements, which allow to focus the electrons and increase the intensity of high-energy electrons.",Human
"We present a rigorous procedure to derive coarse-grained red blood cell (RBC) models, which lead to accurate mechanical properties of realistic RBCs. Based on a semi-analytic theory linear and non-linear elastic properties of the RBC membrane can be matched with those obtained in optical tweezers stretching experiments. In addition, we develop a nearly stress-free model which avoids a number of pitfalls of existing RBC models, such as non-biconcave equilibrium shape and dependence of RBC mechanical properties on the triangulation quality. The proposed RBC model is suitable for use in many existing numerical methods, such as Lattice Boltzmann, Multiparticle Collision Dynamics, Immersed Boundary, etc.",Human
"We describe the design, fabrication, and spectroscopy of coupled, high Quality (Q) factor silicon nanobeam photonic crystal cavities. We show that the single nanobeam cavity modes are coupled into even and odd superposition modes, and we simulate the frequency and Q factor as a function of nanobeam spacing, demonstrating that a differential wavelength shift of 70 nm between the two modes is possible while maintaining Q factors greater than 10^6. For both on-substrate and free-standing nanobeams, we experimentally monitor the response of the even mode as the gap is varied, and measure Q factors as high as 200,000.",Human
"Following Nye and Berry's analogy with crystal dislocations, an approach to the Burgers vector of a wave dislocation (phase singularity, optical vortex) is proposed. It is defined to be a regularized phase gradient evaluated at the phase singularity, and is computed explicitly. The screw component of this vector is naturally related to the helicoidal twisting of wavefronts along a vortex line, and is related to the helicity of the phase gradient. The edge component is related to the nearby current flow (defined by the phase gradient) perpendicular to the vortex, and the distribution of this component is found numerically for random two-dimensional monochromatic waves.",Human
"We study the dynamics of correlation and variance in systems under the load of environmental factors. A universal effect in ensembles of similar systems under the load of similar factors is described: in crisis, typically, even before obvious symptoms of crisis appear, correlation increases, and, at the same time, variance (and volatility) increases too. This effect is supported by many experiments and observations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial time series.   A general approach to the explanation of the effect through dynamics of individual adaptation of similar non-interactive individuals to a similar system of external factors is developed. Qualitatively, this approach follows Selye's idea about adaptation energy.",Human
"We address the elliptically shaped vortex solitons in defocusing nonlinear media imprinted with a composite Mathieu lattice. Elliptic vortices feature anisotropic patterns both in intensity and phase, and can only exist when their energy flow exceed some certain threshold. Single-charged elliptic vortices are found to arise via bifurcation from dipole modes, which, to the best of our knowledge is the first example in the context of optics studies of symmetry breaking bifurcations for the phase dislocations of different dimensionalities. Higher-order elliptic vortices with topological charge could exhibit spatially separated single-charged phase singularities, leading to their stabilization. The salient features of reported elliptic vortices qualitatively hold for other elliptic shaped confining potentials.",Human
"In this paper, we show by experiment that by covering a thin flat nonlinear lens on the sources, the sub-diffraction-limit observation can be achieved by measuring either the near-field distribution or the far-field radiation of the sources at the harmonic frequencies and calculating the inverse Fourier transformation to obtain the sub-wavelength imaging. Especially, the sub-wavelength image calculated from measured far-field data demonstrates very clear resolution. Since metamaterials included with active elements can easily behave strong nonlinearity under very weak incident electromagnetic powers, the application of the nonlinear lens proposed in this paper would have important potential in improving the sub-wavelength resolution in the near future.",Human
"According to general relativity, a spinning body of mass M and angular momentum S, like a star or a planet, generates a gravitomagnetic field which induces, among other phenomena, also the Lense-Thirring effect, i.e. secular precessions of the path of a test particle orbiting it. Direct and indisputable tests of such a relativistic prediction are still missing. We discuss some performed attempts to measure it in the gravitational fields of several bodies in the Solar System with natural and artificial objects. The focus is on the realistic evaluation of the impact of some competing classical forces regarded as sources of systematic uncertainties degrading the total accuracy obtainable.",Human
The fluid-dynamical model of a self-gravitating mass of viscous liquid with singular density at the center vibrating in fundamental mode is considered in juxtaposition with that for Kelvin fundamental mode in a homogeneous heavy mass of incompressible inviscid liquid. Particular attention is given to the difference between spectral formulae for the frequency and lifetime of $f$-mode in the singular and homogeneous models. The newly obtained results are discussed in the context of theoretical asteroseismology of pre-white dwarf stage of red giants and stellar cocoons -- spherical gas-dust clouds with dense star-forming core at the center.,Human
"The cosmological principle says that the Universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic. It predicts, among other phenomena, the cosmic redshift of light and the Hubble law. Nevertheless, the existence of structure in the Universe violates the (exact) cosmological principle. A more precise formulation of the cosmological principle must allow for the formation of structure and must therefore incorporate probability distributions. In this contribution to the Memorial Volume for Wolfgang Kummer, a great teacher and mentor to me, I discuss how we could formulate a new version of the cosmological principle, how to test it, and how to possibly justify it by fundamental physics. My contribution starts with some of my memories of Wolfgang.",Human
"We use a simple model of Bullard-type disc dynamo, in which the disc rotation rate is subject to harmonic oscillations, to analyze the generation of magnetic field by the parametric resonance mechanism. The problem is governed by a damped Mathieu equation. The Floquet exponents, which define the magnetic field growth rates, are calculated depending on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations. Firstly, we show that the dynamo can be excited at significantly subcritical disc rotation rates when the latter is subject to harmonic oscillations with a certain frequency. Secondly, at supercritical mean rotation rates, the dynamo can also be suppressed but only in narrow frequency bands and at sufficiently large oscillation amplitudes.",Human
"pCVD diamond sensors are regularly used as beam loss monitors in accelerators by measuring the ionization of the lost particles. In the past these beam loss monitors showed sudden increases in the dark leakage current without beam losses and these erratic leakage currents were found to decrease, if magnetic fields were present. Here we report on a systematic study of leakage currents inside a magnetic field. The decrease of erratic currents in a magnetic field was confirmed. On the contrary, diamonds without erratic currents showed an increase of the leakage current in a magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field for fields up to 0.6T, for higher fields it decreases. A preliminary model is introduced to explain the observations.",Human
"We present methods for generating and for sorting specific orbital angular momentum (OAM) eigenmodes of a light beam with high efficiency, using a liquid crystal birefringent plate with unit topological charge, known as \qo{q-plate}. The generation efficiency has been optimized by tuning the optical retardation of the q-plate with temperature. The measured OAM $m=\pm2$ eigenmodes generation efficiency from an input TEM$_{00}$ beam was of 97%. Mode sorting of the two input OAM $m=\pm2$ eigenmodes was achieved with an efficiency of 81% and an extinction-ratio (or cross-talk) larger than 4.5:1.",Human
"Rydberg States are used in our One Atom Maser experiment because they offer a large dipole moment and couple strongly to low numbers of microwave photons in a high Q cavity. Here we report the absolute frequencies of the P$_{3/2}$ states for principal quantum numbers $n=36$ to $n=63$. These measurements were made with a three step laser excitation scheme. A wavemeter was calibrated against a frequency comb to provide accurate absolute frequency measurements over the entire range, reducing the measurement uncertainty to 1MHz. We compare the spectroscopic results with known frequency measurements as a test of measurement accuracy.",Human
"We derive on the level of quantum optics expressions for the uncertainty of the photocount in a multi-mode multi-frequency setup. The result depends on the quantum correlations of the individual modes and the frequency spectrum of the radiation, the latter leading to a frequency beating sometimes referred to as dynamic laser speckle. When the mode structure of the radiation field is disturbed between source and detector, another contribution to the photocount uncertainty referred to as static speckle appears. To predict the size of this effect, we present a suitable definition of the etendue (or phase space volume) that links the number of modes of a radiation field to macroscopic quantities.",Human
"Eighty years after de Broglie's, and a little more than half a century after Bohm's seminal papers, the de Broglie--Bohm theory (a.k.a. Bohmian mechanics), which is presumably the simplest theory which explains the orthodox quantum mechanics formalism, has reached an exemplary state of conceptual clarity and mathematical integrity. No other theory of quantum mechanics comes even close. Yet anyone curious enough to walk this road to quantum mechanics is soon being confused by many misleading signposts that have been put up, and not just by its detractors, but unfortunately enough also by some of its proponents.   This paper outlines a road map to help navigate ones way.",Human
"This paper presents a statistical method to subtract background in maximum likelihood fit, without relying on any separate sideband or simulation for background modeling. The method, called sFit, is an extension to the sPlot technique originally developed to reconstruct true distribution for each date component. The sWeights defined for the sPlot technique allow to construct a modified likelihood function using only the signal probability density function and events in the signal region. Contribution of background events in the signal region to the likelihood function cancels out on a statistical basis. Maximizing this likelihood function leads to unbiased estimates of the fit parameters in the signal probability density function.",Human
"When an infectious disease strikes a population, the number of newly reported cases is often the only available information that one can obtain during early stages of the outbreak. An important goal of early outbreak analysis is to obtain a reliable estimate for the basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, from the limited information available. We present a novel method that enables us to make a reliable real-time estimate of the reproduction number at a much earlier stage compared to other available methods. Our method takes into account the possibility that a disease has a wide distribution of infectious period and that the degree distribution of the contact network is heterogeneous. We validate our analytical framework with numerical simulations.",Human
"We construct a tractable model to describe the rate at which a knotted polymer is ejected from a spherical capsid via a small pore. Knots are too large to fit through the pore and must reptate to the end of the polymer for ejection to occur. The reptation of knots is described by symmetric exclusion on the line, with the internal capsid pressure represented by an additional biased particle that drives knots to the end of the chain. We compute the exact ejection speed for a finite number of knots L and find that it scales as 1/L. We also construct a continuum theory for many knots that matches the exact discrete theory for large L.",Human
"The guided dispersion characteristics of subwavelength nanoscale plasmonic coaxial lines are analyzed in detail over a wide optical frequency range below the plasma frequency with a varying gap between the inner and outer plasmonic conductors, providing important preliminary information for understanding the guided mode characteristics of subwavelength nanoscale coaxial lines with plasmonic metals. In particular, when the inner or outer radius is varied, guided modes with similar and dissimilar dispersive features are obtained and discussed. A brief comparison of the propagating modes for the present subwavelength plasmonic coaxial lines and those for a subwavelength plasmonic hole and wire is also made.",Human
"The promotion of cooperation on spatial lattices is an important issue in evolutionary game theory. This effect clearly depends on the update rule: it diminishes with stochastic imitative rules whereas it increases with unconditional imitation. To study the transition between both regimes, we propose a new evolutionary rule, which stochastically combines unconditional imitation with another imitative rule. We find that, surprinsingly, in many social dilemmas this rule yields higher cooperative levels than any of the two original ones. This nontrivial effect occurs because the basic rules induce a separation of timescales in the microscopic processes at cluster interfaces. The result is robust in the space of 2x2 symmetric games, on regular lattices and on scale-free networks.",Human
The properties of bosonic Ytterbium photoassociation spectra near the intercombination transition $^{1}S_{0}$--$^{3}P_{1}$ are studied theoretically at ultra low temperatures. We demonstrate how the shapes and intensities of rotational components of optical Feshbach resonances are affected by mass tuning of the scattering properties of the two colliding ground state atoms. Particular attention is given to the relationship between the magnitude of the scattering length and the occurrence of shape resonances in higher partial waves of the van der Waals system. We develop a mass scaled model of the excited state potential that represents the experimental data for different isotopes. The shape of the rotational photoassociation spectrum for various bosonic Yb isotopes can be qualitatively different.,Human
We investigate two coupled microdisks with non-identical radii focusing on the parametric evolution of energy levels and the unidirectional far-field emission. We show that the evolution of energy levels is characterized by the avoided crossing intrinsically associated with the exceptional point or the non-Hermitian degeneracy. These spectral properties explain highly asymmetric near-field intensity pattern of the resonance mode. The observed unidirectional far-field emission is shown to be understood by considering the forbidden inter-disk coupling in the ray picture induced by the frustrated total internal reflection near the closest point between two disks when the inter-disk distance is small enough.,Human
"In this article, we analytically study second harmonic (SH) generation from thin metallic films with subwavelength, non-centrosymmetry patterns. Because the thickness of the film is much smaller than the SH wavelength, retardation effects are negligible. The far-field SH intensities are thus dominated by an effective electric dipole. These analytical observations are further justified numerically by studying the effect of polarization of the fundamental field on both the SH signal and the electric dipole. It is demonstrated that bulk SH polarization density is comparable with its surface counterpart. The electric dipole, consequently, originates from the entire {volume of the metallic membrane, in contrast to the fact that SH generation from metal surface is generally dominated by a surface dipole.",Human
"New model describing the pressure effect on the melting temperature is proposed by using four assumptions. One, the average wavelength of the phonon vibration at the Debye temperature corresponds to the length of the unit cell. Two, the phonon vibration at the melting temperature is in self-resonance with the lattice vibration of the surface atomic/molecular layer. Three, the phonon wavelength ratio of the Debye and the melting temperature does not be affected by the pressure. Four the pressure reduces the anharmonic part of the vibration. The relevant equations are derived and tested against the experiments of sodium with positive result.",Human
"Transformation optics is used to design a gateway that can block electromagnetic waves but allows the passage of other entities. Our conceptual device has the advantage that it can be realized with simple materials and structural parameters and can have a reasonably wide bandwidth. In particular, we show that our system can be implemented by using a magnetic photonic crystal structure that employs a square ray of ferrite rods, and as the field response of ferrites can be tuned by external magnetic fields, we end up with an electromagnetic gateway that can be open or shut using external fields. The functionality is also robust against the positional disorder of the rods that made up the photonic crystal.",Human
"A complex network approach on a rough fracture is developed. In this manner, some hidden metric spaces (similarity measurements) between apertures profiles are set up and a general evolutionary network in two directions (in parallel and perpendicular to the shear direction) is constructed. Also, an algorithm (COmplex Networks on Apertures: CONA) is proposed in which evolving of a network is accomplished using preferential detachments and attachments of edges (based on a competition and game manner) while the number of nodes is fixed. Also, evolving of clustering coefficients and number of edges display similar patterns as well as are appeared in shear stress, hydraulic conductivity and dilation changes, which can be engaged to estimate shear strength distribution of asperities.",Human
"We investigate an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game among self-driven agents, where collective motion of biological flocks is imitated through averaging directions of neighbors. Depending on the temptation to defect and the velocity at which agents move, we find that cooperation can not only be maintained in such a system but there exists an optimal size of interaction neighborhood, which can induce the maximum cooperation level. When compared with the case that all agents do not move, cooperation can even be enhanced by the mobility of individuals, provided that the velocity and the size of neighborhood are not too large. Besides, we find that the system exhibits aggregation behavior, and cooperators may coexist with defectors at equilibrium.",Human
"We present a theoretical interpretation of the recently revealed features of temperature evolution in the ultracold plasma clouds released from a magneto-optical trap, namely: (a) its independence at the sufficiently large times on the initial plasma parameters and (b) the asymptotics close to t^{-1} instead of t^{-2}, expected for a rarefied ideal gas. It is shown that both these properties can be well explained by the model of virialization of the charged particle velocities in the regime of strong electron-ion correlations, while heating due to inelastic processes (e.g. three-body recombination) should be of secondary importance. These conclusions are confirmed also by the results of ab initio computer simulations.",Human
"We investigate the spatial and temporal features of dense contaminant plumes dynamics in porous materials. Our analysis is supported by novel experimental results concerning pollutant concentration profiles inside a vertical column setup. We describe the experimental methods and elucidate the salient outcomes of the measurements, with focus on miscible fluids in homogeneous saturated media. By resorting to a finite elements approach, we numerically solve the equations that rule the pollutants migration and compare the simulation results with the experimental data. Finally, we qualitatively explore the interfacial dynamics behavior between the dense contaminant plume and the lighter resident fluid that saturates the column.",Human
"The data analysis of aftershock events of L Aquila earthquake in Apennines following the main 6.3 Mw event of April 6, 2009 has been carried out by standard statistical geophysical tools. The results show the heterogeneity of seismic activity in five different geographical sub-regions indicated by anomalous critical indices of power law distributions: the exponents of the Omori law, the b values of Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency distribution, and the distribution of waiting times. The heterogeneous distribution of dynamic stress and a different morphology in the five sub-regions has been found and two anomalous sub-regions have been identified.",Human
"We present an efficient approach to evaluate two-center two-electron integrals with exponential functions and with an arbitrary polynomial in electron-nucleus and electron-electron distances. We show that the master integral with the single negative power of all distances can be obtained from the second order differential equation in $r$, the distance between nuclei. For particular values of nonlinear parameters corresponding to the James-Coolidge basis, we find a fully analytic expression. For integrals with arbitrary powers of all distances, we construct recursion relations which starts from the master integral. The presented approach opens a window for the high precision calculations of relativistic effects in diatomic molecules.",Human

It provides a panoramic view of the main theoretical developments in high energy physics since its inception more than half a century ago, a period in which experiments have spanned an enormous range of energies, theories have been developed leading up to the Standard Model, and proposals -- including the radical paradigm of String Theory -- have been made to go beyond the Standard Model. The list of references provided here is not intended to properly credit all original work but rather to supply the reader with a few pointers to the literature, specifically highlighting work done by Indian authors.",Human
"Solar UV emission has a profound impact on the upper terrestrial atmosphere. Because of instrumental constraints, however, solar proxies often need to be used as substitutes for the solar spectral variability. Finding proxies that properly reproduce specific spectral bands or lines is an ongoing problem. Using daily observations from 2003 to 2008 and a multiscale statistical approach, we test the performances of 9 proxies for the UV solar flux. Their relevance is evaluated at different time-scales and a novel representation allows all quantities to be compared simultaneously. This representation reveals which proxies are most appropriate for different spectral bands and for different time scales.",Human
"The Sun provides the main energy input to the terrestrial atmosphere, and yet the impact of solar variability on long-term changes remains a controversial issue. Direct radiative forcing is the most studied mechanism. Other much weaker mechanisms, however, can have a significant leverage, but the underlying physics is often poorly known.   We review the main mechanisms by which solar variability may impact the terrestrial atmosphere, on time scales ranging from days to millennia. This includes radiative forcing, but also the effect of interplanetary perturbations and energetic particle fluxes, all of which are eventually driven by the solar magnetic field.",Human

"We study the statistical properties of the network constructed from the energy dissipation rate time series in the three dimensional developed turbulence using the visibility algorithm. The degree distribution is found to have a power-law tail with the tail exponent $\alpha=3.0$. The exponential relationship between the number of the boxes $N_B$ and the box size $l_B$ in the edge-covering box-counting method illustrates that the network is not self-similar, which is also confirmed by the hub-hub attraction according to the visibility algorithm. In addition, it is found that the skeleton of the visibility network exhibits excellent allometric scaling with the scaling exponent $\eta=1.163\pm0.005$.",Human

"Optical dipole traps and atom chips are two very powerful tools for the quantum manipulation of neutral atoms. We demonstrate that both methods can be combined by creating an optical lattice potential on an atom chip. A red-detuned laser beam is retro-reflected using the atom chip surface as a high-quality mirror, generating a vertical array of purely optical oblate traps. We load thermal atoms from the chip into the lattice and observe cooling into the two-dimensional regime where the thermal energy is smaller than a quantum of transverse excitation. Using a chip-generated Bose-Einstein condensate, we demonstrate coherent Bloch oscillations in the lattice.",Human
"We present and discuss a variance-reduced stochastic particle method for simulating the relaxation-time model of the Boltzmann transport equation. The present paper focuses on the dilute gas case, although the method is expected to directly extend to all fields (carriers) for which the relaxation-time approximation is reasonable. The variance reduction, achieved by simulating only the deviation from equilibrium, results in a significant computational efficiency advantage compared to traditional stochastic particle methods in the limit of small deviation from equilibrium. More specifically, the proposed method can efficiently simulate arbitrarily small deviations from equilibrium at a computational cost that is independent of the deviation from equilibrium, which is in sharp contrast to traditional particle methods.",Human
"We present a generalized discontinuous Galerkin method for a multicomponent compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes system of equations. The system presented has a functional viscosity nu which depends on the pressure p=p(rho,mu_i) of the flow, with the density rho and the local concentration mu_i. High order Runge-Kutta time discretization techniques are employed, and different methods of dealing with arbitrary coupled boundary conditions are discussed. Analysis of the energy consistency of the scheme is performed in addition to inspection of the relative error of the solution compared to exact analytic test cases. Finally several examples, comparisons, generalizations and physical applications are presented.",Human
"Bhabha's scientific research contributions are descibed in the context of his life and contemporary science. During the Cambridge period(1927-1939),he worked in Positron theory(Bhabha scattering),Cosmic rays (Bhabha- Heitler theory of cosmic ray showers,prediction of heavier electrons) and Meson theory.In Bangalore during 1939-1945, he worked on classical relativistic spinning particles (Bhabha-Corben equations),meson theory and initiated experimental work in cosmic rays in India.He then founded Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in1945 at Bombay and moved there. Here he started work on relativistic wave equations (Bhabha eqns.).He also initiated India's nuclear energy programme in 1948 and this was his main preoccupation later.",Human
We demonstrate laser slowing of a hot thulium atomic beam using the nearly closed cycling transition $4\textrm{f}^{13}6\textrm{s}^2(^2\textrm{F}^\circ)(J=7/2)\leftrightarrow4\textrm{f}^{12}(^3\textrm{H}_5)5\textrm{d}_{3/2}6\textrm{s}^2(J=9/2)$ at 410.6 nm. Atoms are decelerated to velocities around 25 m/s by a 40 cm Zeeman slower. The flux of slowed atoms is evaluated as $10^7 \textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{cm}^{-2}$. The experiment explicitly indicates the possibility of trapping Tm atoms in a magneto-optical trap.,Human
"In this work we combine the large per-photon optical gradient force with the sensitive feedback of a high quality factor whispering-gallery microcavity. The cavity geometry, consisting of a pair of silica disks separated by a nanoscale gap, shows extremely strong dynamical backaction, powerful enough to excite giant coherent oscillations even under heavily damped conditions (mechanical Q=4). In vacuum, the threshold for regenerative mechanical oscillation is lowered to an optical input power of only 270-nanoWatts, or roughly 1000 stored cavity photons, and efficient cooling of the mechanical motion is obtained with a temperature compression factor of 13-dB for 4-microWatts of dropped optical input power.",Human
"A new regime of turbulent convection has been reported nearly one decade ago, based on global heat transfer measurements at very high Rayleigh numbers. We examine the signature of this ""Ultimate Regime"" from within the flow itself. A systematic study of probe-size corrections shows that the earlier temperature measurements within the flow were altered by an excessive size of thermometer, but not according to a theoretical model proposed in the literature. Using a probe one order of magnitude smaller than the one used previously, we find evidence that the transition to the Ultimate Regime is indeed accompanied with a clear change in the statistics of temperature fluctuations in the flow.",Human
"Transformation-based cylindrical cloaks and concentrators are illuminated with non-monochromatic waves and unusual effects are observed with interesting potential applications. The transient responses of the devices are studied numerically with the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method and the results are verified with analytical formulas. We compute the effective bandwidth of several cloaking schemes as well as the effect of losses on the performance of the structures. We also find that narrowband behavior, frequency shift effects, time delays and spatial disturbances of the incoming waves are dominant due to the inherently dispersive nature of the devices. These effects are important and should be taken into account when designing metamaterial-based devices.",Human
"Producing useful electrical work in consuming chemical energy, the fuel cell have to reject heat to its surrounding. However, as it occurs for any other type of engine, this thermal energy cannot be exchanged in an isothermal way in finite time through finite areas. As it was already done for various types of systems, we study the fuel cell within the finite time thermodynamics framework and define an endoreversible fuel cell. Considering different types of heat transfer laws, we obtain an optimal value of the operating temperature, corresponding to a maximum produced power. This analysis is a first step of a thermodynamical approach of design of thermal management devices, taking into account performances of the whole system.",Human
"We report a 1.036 GHz gated Geiger mode InGaAs avalanche photodiode with a detection dead time of just 1.93 ns. This is demonstrated by full recovery of the detection efficiency two gate cycles after a detection event, as well as a measured maximum detection rate of 497 MHz. As an application, we measure the second order correlation function $g^{(2)}$ of the emission from a diode laser with a single detector which works reliably at high speed owing to the extremely short dead time of the detector. The device is ideal for high bit rate fiber wavelength quantum key distribution and photonic quantum computing.",Human
"To ensure homogeneous conditions within the complete area of perfused microfluidic bio-reactors, we develop a general design of a continuously feed bio-reactor with uniform perfusion flow. This is achieved by introducing a specific type of perfusion inlet to the reaction area. The geometry of these inlets are found using the methods of topology optimization and shape optimization. The results are compared with two different analytic models, from which a general parametric description of the design is obtained and tested numerically. Such a parametric description will generally be beneficial for the design of a broad range of microfluidic bioreactors used for e.g. cell culturing and analysis, and in feeding bio-arrays.",Human
"In this brief report, a thermal lattice-Boltzmann (LB) model is presented for axisymmetric thermal flows in the incompressible limit. The model is based on the double-distribution-function LB method, which has attracted much attention since its emergence for its excellent numerical stability. Compared with the existing axisymmetric thermal LB models, the present model is simpler and retains the inherent features of the standard LB method. Numerical simulations are carried out for the thermally developing laminar flows in circular ducts and the natural convection in an annulus between two coaxial vertical cylinders. The Nusselt number obtained from the simulations agrees well with the analytical solutions and/or the results reported in previous studies.",Human
"We report an experimental study of the 1064nm transition dipoles in neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) by measuring the coupling constant between two orthogonal modes of a laser cavity for different cuts of the YAG gain crystal. We propose a theoretical model in which the transition dipoles, slightly elliptic, are oriented along the crystallographic axes. Our experimental measurements show a very good quantitative agreement with this model, and predict a dipole ellipticity between 2% and 3%. This work provides an experimental evidence for the simple description in which transition dipoles and crystallographic axes are collinear in Nd-YAG (with an accuracy better than 1 deg), a point that has been discussed for years.",Human
"We address the problem of how the survival of cooperation in a social system depends on the motion of the individuals. Specifically, we study a model in which Prisoner's Dilemma players are allowed to move in a two-dimensional plane. Our results show that cooperation can survive in such a system provided that both the temptation to defect and the velocity at which agents move are not too high. Moreover, we show that when these conditions are fulfilled, the only asymptotic state of the system is that in which all players are cooperators. Our results might have implications for the design of cooperative strategies in motion coordination and other applications including wireless networks.",Human
"We study the dynamics of some uniform learning strategy limits or a probabilistic version of the ""Kolkata Paise Restaurant"" problem, where N agents choose among N equally priced but differently ranked restaurants every evening such that each agent can get dinner in the best possible ranked restaurant (each serving only one customer and the rest arriving there going without dinner that evening). We consider the learning to be uniform among the agents and assume that each follow the same probabilistic strategy dependent on the information of the past successes in the game. The numerical results for utilization of the restaurants in some limiting cases are analytically examined.",Human
"Here we propose and demonstrate an all-optical wavelength-routing approach which uses a tuning mechanism based upon the optical gradient force in a specially-designed nano-optomechanical system. The resulting mechanically-compliant ""spiderweb"" resonantor realizes seamless wavelength routing over a range of 3000 times the intrinsic channel width, with a tuning efficiency of 309-GHz/mW, a switching time of less than 200-ns, and 100% channel-quality preservation over the entire tuning range. These results indicate the potential for radiation pressure actuated devices to be used in a variety of photonics applications, such as channel routing/switching, buffering, dispersion compensation, pulse trapping/release, and widely tunable lasers.",Human
"A two-parameter family of complexity measures $\tilde{C}^{(\alpha,\beta)}$ based on the R\'enyi entropies is introduced and characterized by a detailed study of its mathematical properties. This family is the generalization of a continuous version of the LMC complexity, which is recovered for $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=2$. These complexity measures are obtained by multiplying two quantities bringing global information on the probability distribution defining the system. When one of the parameters, $\alpha$ or $\beta$, goes to infinity, one of the global factors becomes a local factor. For this special case, the complexity is calculated on different quantum systems: H-atom, harmonic oscillator and square well.",Human
"We introduce a new fundamental property of waveguides induced by the forces of the guided light, namely, the ability to self align or be in instability. A nanoscale waveguide broken by an offset and a gap may tend to self align to form a continuous waveguide. Conversely, depending on the geometry and light polarization, the two parts of the waveguide may be deflected away from each other, thus being in an unstable state. These effects are unique as they rely on the presence of both the guided mode and the scattered light. Strong self alignment forces may be facilitated by near field interaction with polarization surface charges.",Human
"We apply the laws of human gait vertical ground reaction force and discover the existence of the phenomenon of least action principle in gait. Using a capacitive mat transducer system, we obtain the variations of human gait vertical ground reaction force and establish a structure equation for the resultant of such a force. Defining the deviation of vertical force as an action function, we observe from our gait optimization analysis the least action principle at half of the stride time. We develop an evaluation index of mechanical energy consumption based upon the least action principle in gait. We conclude that these observations can be employed to enhance the accountability of gait evaluation.",Human
"The present work studies the isotropic and homogeneous turbulence for incompressible fluids through a specific Lyapunov analysis, assuming that the turbulence is due to the bifurcations associated to the velocity field.   The analysis consists in the study of the mechanism of the energy cascade from large to small scales through the Lyapunov analysis of the relative motion between two particles and in the calculation of the velocity fluctuation through the Lyapunov analysis of the local deformation and the Navier-Stokes equations.   The analysis provides an explanation for the mechanism of the energy cascade, leads to the closure of the von K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation, and describes the statistics of the velocity difference.   Several tests and numerical results are presented.",Human
"This paper introduces a new approach to describe the spread of research topics across disciplines using epidemic models. The approach is based on applying individual-based models from mathematical epidemiology to the diffusion of a research topic over a contact network that represents knowledge flows over the map of science -as obtained from citations between ISI Subject Categories. Using research publications on the protein class kinesin as a case study, we report a better fit between model and empirical data when using the citation-based contact network. Incubation periods on the order of 4 to 15.5 years support the view that, whilst research topics may grow very quickly, they face difficulties to overcome disciplinary boundaries.",Human
"A novel method is presented for the beam shaping of far field intensity distributions of coherently combined fiber arrays. The fibers are arranged uniformly on the perimeter of a circle, and the linearly polarized beams of equal shape are superimposed such that the far field pattern represents an effective radially polarized vector beam, or discrete cylindrical vector (DCV) beam. The DCV beam is produced by three or more beams that each individually have a varying polarization vector. The beams are appropriately distributed in the near field such that the far field intensity distribution has a central null. This result is in contrast to the situation of parallel linearly polarized beams, where the intensity peaks on axis.",Human
"We propose and analyze a scheme to interface individual neutral atoms with nanoscale solid-state systems. The interface is enabled by optically trapping the atom via the strong near-field generated by a sharp metallic nanotip. We show that under realistic conditions, a neutral atom can be trapped with position uncertainties of just a few nanometers, and within tens of nanometers of other surfaces. Simultaneously, the guided surface plasmon modes of the nanotip allow the atom to be optically manipulated, or for fluorescence photons to be collected, with very high efficiency. Finally, we analyze the surface forces and heating and decoherence rates acting on the trapped atom.",Human
We realize a flat lens with graded negative refractive index by a two-dimensional phononic crystal. The index-grade is achieved by gradual modification of the filling fraction along the transverse direction to propagation. We demonstrate that this lens can realize the focusing and amplification of parallel incident acoustic waves. A formula for the refractive index profile is derived by which the lens with desired focal length can be precisely designed and the aberrations of image can be effectively reduced. This designable lens is expected to bear significance in applications such as coupling or integration with various types of acoustic devices.,Human
"By studying the statistics of recurrence intervals, $\tau$, between volatilities of Internet traffic rate changes exceeding a certain threshold $q$, we find that the probability distribution functions, $P_{q}(\tau)$, for both byte and packet flows, show scaling property as $P_{q}(\tau)=\frac{1}{\overline{\tau}}f(\frac{\tau}{\overline{\tau}})$. The scaling functions for both byte and packet flows obeys the same stretching exponential form, $f(x)=A\texttt{exp}(-Bx^{\beta})$, with $\beta \approx 0.45$. In addition, we detect a strong memory effect that a short (or long) recurrence interval tends to be followed by another short (or long) one. The detrended fluctuation analysis further demonstrates the presence of long-term correlation in recurrence intervals.",Human
"We have studied the nature of classical work ($W_{c}$) and thermodynamic work ($W$) fluctuations in systems driven out of equilibrium both in transient and time periodic steady state. As the observation time of trajectory increases, we show that the number of trajectories which exhibit excursions away from the typical behaviour i.e., $W_{c}<0$, $W<\Delta F$ and dissipated heat $Q<0$ decreases as anticipated for macroscopic time scales. Analytical expressions for such trajectories are obtained. Trajectory for which $W_{c}<0$ may not correspond to $W<\Delta F$ or $Q<0$. The applicability of steady state fluctuation theorems are discussed in our linear as well as nonlinear models.",Human
"In an attempt to understand why the dominating magnetic field observed in the von-K\'arm\'an-Sodium (VKS) dynamo experiment is axisymmetric, we investigate in the present paper the ability of mean field models to generate axisymmetric eigenmodes in cylindrical geometries. An $\alpha$-effect is added to the induction equation and we identify reasonable and necessary properties of the $\alpha$ distribution so that axisymmetric eigenmodes are generated. The parametric study is done with two different simulation codes. We find that simple distributions of $\alpha$-effect, either concentrated in the disk neighbourhood or occupying the bulk of the flow, require unrealistically large values of the parameter $\alpha$ to explain the VKS observations.",Human
"Optical mushroom shaped billiards offer a unique opportunity to isolate and study non-dispersive, marginally unstable periodic orbits. Here we show that the openness of the cavity to external fields presents unanticipated consequences for the far-field distribution, including directional emission. This is mediated by interactions of marginally unstable periodic orbits with chaotic modes and is potentially relevant for the design of microcavity lasers. We also show that such orbits are robust against perturbations to the shape of the cavity, despite the non-generic character of the classical counterpart and the lack of structural stability of the corresponding classical orbits.",Human
"We interpret the subgraph centrality as the partition function of a network. The entropy, the internal energy and the Helmholtz free energy are defined for networks and molecular graphs on the basis of graph spectral theory. Various relations of these quantities to the structure and the dynamics of the complex networks are discussed. They include the cohesiveness of the network and the critical coupling of coupled phase oscillators. We explore several models of network growing/evolution as well as real-world networks, such as those representing metabolic and protein-protein interaction networks as well as the interaction between secondary structure elements in proteins.",Human
"The ALPS collaboration runs a light-shining-through-walls (LSW) experiment to search for photon oscillations into ""weakly interacting sub-eV particles"" (WISPs) inside of a superconducting HERA dipole magnet at the site of DESY. In this paper we report on the first successful integration of a large-scale optical cavity to boost the available power for WISP production in this type of experiments. The key elements are a frequency tunable narrow line-width continuous wave laser acting as the primary light source and an electronic feed-back control loop to stabilize the power build-up. We describe and characterize our apparatus and demonstrate the data analysis procedures on the basis of a brief exemplary run.",Human
"Grid-based discretizations of the time dependent Schr\""odinger equation coupled to an external magnetic field are converted to manifest gauge invariant discretizations. This is done using generalizations of ideas used in classical lattice gauge theory, and the process defined is applicable to a large class of discretized differential operators. In particular, popular discretizations such as pseudospectral discretizations using the fast Fourier transform can be transformed to gauge invariant schemes. Also generic gauge invariant versions of generic time integration methods are considered, enabling completely gauge invariant calculations of the time dependent Schr\""odinger equation. Numerical examples illuminating the differences between a gauge invariant discretization and conventional discretization procedures are also presented.",Human
"We present evidences of the diffusive motion of the ground and tunnels and show that if systematic movements are excluded then the remaining uncorrelated component of the motion obeys a characteristic fractal law with the displacement variance dY^2 scaling with time- and spatial intervals T and L as dY^2 \propto T^(Alpha)L^(Gamma) with both exponents close to 1. We briefly describe experimental methods of the mesa- and microscopic ground motion detection used in the measurements at the physics research facilities sensitive to the motion, particularly, large high energy elementary particle accelerators. A simple mathematical model of the fractal motion demonstrating the observed scaling law is also presented and discussed.",Human
"Weighted histograms in Monte Carlo simulations are often used for the estimation of probability density functions. They are obtained as a result of random experiments with random events that have weights. In this paper, the bin contents of a weighted histogram are considered as a sum of random variables with a random number of terms. Generalizations of the classical chi-square test for comparing weighted histograms was proposed. Numerical examples illustrate an application of the tests for the histograms with different statistics of events and different weighted functions. The proposed tests can be used for the comparison of experimental data histograms with simulated data histograms, as well as for the two simulated data histograms.",Human
"We analyze the Bombay stock exchange (BSE) price index over the period of last 12 years. Keeping in mind the large fluctuations in last few years, we carefully find out the transient, non-statistical and locally structured variations. For that purpose, we make use of Daubechies wavelet and characterize the fractal behavior of the returns using a recently developed wavelet based fluctuation analysis method. the returns show a fat-tail distribution as also weak non-statistical behavior. We have also carried out continuous wavelet as well as Fourier power spectral analysis to characterize the periodic nature and correlation properties of the time series.",Human
"ALICE at CERN-LHC is an experiment dedicated to the study of high-energy heavy-ion collision. In this paper we will briefly describe the experimental layout and give an overview on the installation status of the ALICE detector components including an outlook towards the completion of the staged detector setup. We will review the commissioning of the detector components with emphasis on the central detectors, in particular the time projection chamber (TPC). The commissioning took place in summer 2008 awaiting the first beams from the LHC in the fall. The result from commissioning are compared with the performance figures, which are outlined in the ALICE Physics Performance Reports.",Human
"The previous twelve turnout rates of French national elections by municipality show regularities. These regularities do not depend on the national turnout level, nor on the nature of the election. Based on past statistical regularities we make three predictions. The first one deals with the standard deviation of the turnout rate by municipality. The second one refers to the continuity in time of the heterogeneity of turnout rates in the vicinity of a municipality. The last one is about the correlation between the heterogeneity of turnout rates in the vicinity of a municipality and the population in its surroundings. Details, explanations and discussions will be given in forthcoming papers.",Human
"The temperature behaviour in the range 22\degree C to 500\degree C of the dielectric permittivity in the infrared range is investigated for CaF2, BaF2 and Al2O3 through reflectivity measurements. The dielectric permittivity is retrieved by fitting reflectivity spectra with a model taking into account multiphonon contributions. The results extrapolated from the measurements are applied to predict a temperature-dependent atom-surface van der Waals interaction. We specifically consider as the atom of interest Cs (8P3/2), the most relevant virtual couplings of which, fall in the range of thermal radiation and are located in the vicinity of the reststrahlen band of fluoride materials.",Human
"We study two kinds of economic exchange, additive and multiplicative, in a system of N agents. The work is divided in two parts, in the first one, the agents are free to interact with each other. The system evolves to a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution with additive exchange and condenses with a multiplicative one. If bankruptcy is introduced, both types of exchange lead to condensation. Condensation times have been studied. In the second part, the agents are placed in a social network. We analyze the behavior of wealth distributions in time, and the formation of economic classes was observed for certain values of network connectivity.",Human
"The structure of networks that provide optimal transport properties has been investigated in a variety of contexts. While many different formulations of this problem have been considered, it is recurrently found that optimal networks are trees. It is shown here that this result is contingent on the assumption of a stationary flow through the network. When time variations or fluctuations are allowed for, a different class of optimal structures is found, which share the hierarchical organization of trees yet contain loops. The transitions between different network topologies as the parameters of the problem vary are examined. These results may have strong implications for the structure and formation of natural networks, as is illustrated by the example of leaf venation networks.",Human
"Imaging technologies such as dynamic viewpoint generation are engineered for incoherent radiation using the traditional light field, and for coherent radiation using electromagnetic field theory. We present a model of coherent image formation that strikes a balance between the utility of the light field and the comprehensive predictive power of Maxwell's equations. We synthesize research in optics and signal processing to formulate, capture, and form images from quasi light fields, which extend the light field from incoherent to coherent radiation. Our coherent cameras generalize the classic beamforming algorithm in sensor array processing, and invite further research on alternative notions of image formation.",Human
"The traditional cultures of Aboriginal Australians include a significant astronomical component, which is usually reported in terms of songs or stories associated with stars and constellations. Here we argue that the astronomical components extend further, and include a search for meaning in the sky, beyond simply mirroring the earth-bound understanding. In particular, we have found that traditional Aboriginal cultures include a deep understanding of the motion of objects in the sky, and that this knowledge was used for practical purposes such as constructing calendars. We also present evidence that traditional Aboriginal Australians made careful records and measurements of cyclical phenomena, and paid careful attention to unexpected phenomena such as eclipses and meteorite impacts.",Human
"Possibilities and difficulties of applying the theory of magnetic field generation by convection flows in rotating spherical fluid shells to the Giant Planets are outlined. Recent progress in the understanding of the distribution of electrical conductivity in the Giant Planets suggests that the dynamo process occurs predominantly in regions of semiconductivity. In contrast to the geodynamo the magnetic field generation in the Giant Planets is thus characterized by strong radial conductivity variations. The importance of the constraint on the Ohmic dissipation provided by the planetary luminosity is emphasized. Planetary dynamos are likely to be of an oscillatory type, although these oscillations may not be evident from the exterior of the planets.",Human
"The erosion of lunar soil by rocket exhaust plumes is investigated experimentally. This has identified the diffusion-driven flow in the bulk of the sand as an important but previously unrecognized mechanism for erosion dynamics. It has also shown that slow regime cratering is governed by the recirculation of sand in the widening geometry of the crater. Scaling relationships and erosion mechanisms have been characterized in detail for the slow regime. The diffusion-driven flow occurs in both slow and fast regime cratering. Because diffusion-driven flow had been omitted from the lunar erosion theory and from the pressure cratering theory of the Apollo and Viking era, those theories cannot be entirely correct.",Human
"We examine closely the motion of the south-pointing chariot on a surface by taking into account the fact that both wheels have to roll without slipping. We firstly develop a procedure of successive approximations. In the limit where the distance between the wheels tends to zero, we find again the result due to Santander that the pointer is parallel transported. This is longer true generally within the first-order approximation. We secondly determine in an exact manner the motion of the south-pointing chariot on the sphere. Then, we define a pointer and we prove that this one is parallel transported exactly.",Human
"In this paper, we present an application of neural networks in the renewable energy domain. We have developed a methodology for the daily prediction of global solar radiation on a horizontal surface. We use an ad-hoc time series preprocessing and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in order to predict solar radiation at daily horizon. First results are promising with nRMSE < 21% and RMSE < 998 Wh/m2. Our optimized MLP presents prediction similar to or even better than conventional methods such as ARIMA techniques, Bayesian inference, Markov chains and k-Nearest-Neighbors approximators. Moreover we found that our data preprocessing approach can reduce significantly forecasting errors.",Human
"Analytical solutions are presented for the electromagnetic radiation by an arbitrary pulsed source into a homogeneous time-varying background medium. In the constant-impedance case an explicit radiation formula is obtained for the synchronous permittivity and permeability described by any positive function of time. As might be expected, such a medium introduces significant spectral shifts and spatio-temporal modulation, which are analized here for the linear and exponential time-variations of the medium parameters. In the varying-impedance case the solution is obtained for the fourth-order polynomial time-dependence of the permittivity. In addition to the spectral shifts and modulation this spatially homogeneous medium scatters the field introducing causal echoes at the receiver location.",Human
"The computational cost of a Monte Carlo algorithm can only be meaningfully discussed when taking into account the magnitude of the resulting statistical error. Aiming for a fixed error per particle, we study the scaling behavior of the diffusion Monte Carlo method for large quantum systems. We identify the correlation within the population of walkers as the dominant scaling factor for large systems. While this factor is negligible for small and medium sized systems that are typically studied, it ultimately shows exponential scaling. The scaling factor can be estimated straightforwardly for each specific system and we find that is typically only becomes relevant for systems containing more than several hundred atoms.",Human
The interaction of the two counter-propagating ultrashort laser pulses with a singular wavefronts in the thin slice of the underdense plasma is considered. It is shown that ion-acoustic wave is excited via Brillouin three-wave resonance by corkscrew interference pattern of a paraxial singular laser beams. The orbital angular momentum carried by light is transferred to plasma ion-acoustic vortex. The rotation of the density perturbations of electron fluid is the cause of helical current which produce the kilogauss axial quasi-static magnetic field. The exact analytical configurations are presented for an ion-acoustic current field and magnetic induction. The range of experimentally accessible parameters is evaluated.,Human
"We investigate a toy model of inductive interacting agents aiming to forecast a continuous, exogenous random variable E. Private information on E is spread heterogeneously across agents. Herding turns out to be the preferred forecasting mechanism when heterogeneity is maximal. However in such conditions aggregating information efficiently is hard even in the presence of learning, as the herding ratio rises significantly above the efficient-market expectation of 1 and remarkably close to the empirically observed values. We also study how different parameters (interaction range, learning rate, cost of information and score memory) may affect this scenario and improve efficiency in the hard phase.",Human
Tunneling electron-positron pair production is studied in a new setup in which a strong low-frequency and a weak high-frequency laser field propagate in the same direction and collide head-on with a relativistic nucleus. The electron-positron pair production rate is calculated analytically in the limit in which in the nucleus rest frame the strong field is undercritical and the frequency of the weak field is below and close to the pair production threshold. By changing the frequency of the weak field one can reduce the tunneling barrier substantially. As a result tunneling pair production is shown to be observable with presently available technology.,Human
"It is proposed to treat cancer by the combination of a strong magnetic field with intense ultrasound. At the low electrical conductivity of tissue the magnetic field is not frozen into the tissue, and oscillates against the tissue which is brought into rapid oscillation by the ultrasound. As a result, a rapidly oscillating electric field is induced in the tissue, strong enough to disrupt cancer cell replication. Unlike radio frequency waves, which have been proposed for this purpose, ultrasound can be easily focused onto the regions to be treated. This method has the potential for the complete eradication of the tumor.",Human
"A scheme for an X-ray free electron laser is proposed, based on a Raman process occurring during the interaction between a moderately relativistic bunch of free electrons, and twin intense short pulse lasers interfering to form a transverse standing wave along the electron trajectories. In the high intensity regime of the Kapitza-Dirac effect, the laser ponderomotive potential forces the electrons into a lateral oscillatory motion, resulting in a Raman scattering process. I show how a parametric process is triggered, resulting in the amplification of the Stokes component of the Raman-scattered photons. Experimental operating parameters and implementations, based both on LINAC and Laser Wakefield Acceleration techniques, are discussed.",Human
"We consider the problem of oscillation damping in air of a thermally actuated microlever as it is gradually approached towards an infinite wall in parallel geometry. As the gap is decreased from 20 nm down to 400 nm, we observe the increasing damping of the lever Brownian motion in the fluid laminar regime. This manifests itself as a linear decrease with distance of the lever quality factor accompanied by a dramatic softening of its resonance, and eventually leads to the freezing of the CL oscillation. We are able to quantitatively explain this behavior by analytically solving the Navier-Stokes equation with perfect slip boundary conditions. Our findings may have implications for microfluidics and micro- nano-electromechanical applications.",Human

This calorimeter will be made of LYSO crystals readout by Silicon Photomultipliers, to achieve an energy resolution better than 8% at 200 MeV.",Human
"Almost all the ""Voyages Extraordinaires"" written by Jules Verne refer to astronomy. In some of them, astronomy is even the leading theme. However, Jules Verne was basically not learned in science. His knowledge of astronomy came from contemporaneous popular publications and discussions with specialists among his friends or his family. In this article, I examine, from the text and illustrations of his novels, how astronomy was perceived and conveyed by Jules Verne, with errors and limitations on the one hand, with great respect and enthusiasm on the other hand. This informs us on how astronomy was understood by an ""honn\^ete homme"" in the late 19th century.",Human
"Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy has been performed on silver nanoparticles in a scanning electron microscopy setup. Peaks appearing in the visible range for particles fabricated on silicon substrate are shown to arrive from excitation of out of plane eigenmodes by the electron beam. Monochromatic emission maps have been shown to resolve spatial field variation of resonant plasmon mode on length scale smaller than 25nm. Finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations are performed for both the cases of light excitation and electron excitation. The results of radiative emission under electron excitation show an excellent agreement with experiments. A complete vectorial description of induced field is given, which complements the information obtained from experiments.",Human
"We propose a scheme to dynamically create a supersolid state in an optical lattice, using an attractive mixture of mass-imbalanced bosons. Starting from a ""molecular"" quantum crystal, supersolidity is induced dynamically as an out-of-equilibrium state. When neighboring molecular wavefunctions overlap, both bosonic species simultaneously exhibit quasi-condensation and long-range solid order, which is stabilized by their mass imbalance. Supersolidity appears in a perfect one-dimensional crystal, without the requirement of doping. Our model can be realized in present experiments with bosonic mixtures that feature simple on-site interactions, clearing the path to the observation of supersolidity.",Human
"We present a new optoelectronic architecture intended for chaotic optical intensity generation. The principle relies on an electro-optic non-linear delay dynamics, which non linearity is performed by a 4-waves integrated optics interferometer involving 2 independent electro-optic modulation inputs. The setup allows both to have an ultra-fast dynamics up to several GHz frequencies, and potentially high dimensional chaos intended for encryption of optical data at the physical layer. We have built a mathematical model of the system and analyzed a number of its possible solutions: stable steady states, periodic and chaotic regimes. The experimental observations allowed to validate the dynamical model, through good qualitative agreements with the numerical simulations.",Human
"The upgrade of the DA$\Phi$NE machine layout requires a modification of the size and position of the inner focusing quadrupoles of KLOE-2 thus asking for the realization of two new calorimeters covering the quadrupoles area. To improve the reconstruction of $K_L\to 2\pi^0$ events with photons hitting the quadrupoles a calorimeter with high efficiency to low energy photons (20-300 MeV), time resolution of less than 1 ns and space resolution of few cm, is needed. To match these requirements, we are designing a tile calorimeter, QCALT, where each single tile is readout by mean of SiPM for a total granularity of 2400 channels. We show first tests of the different calorimeter components.",Human
"A cylindrical system is proposed that will store magnetic energy in a localized azimuthal field that can then be quickly released on Alfvenic timescales, accompanied by the formation of a flowing Z-pinch plasma. The magnetized plasma is MHD in character and will have unilateral axial momentum with Alfvenic speeds. Conventional plasma gun injectors (Marshall type) have a limited parameter space of operation. The ""magnetic spring"" momentum injector differs from Marshall guns in that it has an already stored strong magnetic field before release. The resulting parameter space is much broader. There are possible applications to momentum injectors for fusion and to plasma and rail guns.",Human
"We study experimentally the influence of the intensity of the infrared (IR) probe field on attosecond pulse train (APT) phase measurements performed with the RABITT method (Reconstruction of Attosecond Beating by Interference in Two-Photon Transitions). We find that if a strong IR field is applied, the attosecond pulses will appear to have lower-than-actual chirp rates. We also observe the onset of the streaking regime in the breakdown of the weak-field RABITT conditions. We perform a Fourier-analysis of harmonic and sideband continuum states and show that the mutual phase relation of the harmonics can be extracted from higher Fourier components.",Human
"Research work in the area of the Global Electric Circuit (GEC) has rapidly expanded in recent years mainly through observations of lightning from satellites and ground-based networks and observations of optical emissions between cloud and the ionosphere. After reviewing this progress, we critically examine the role of various generators of the currents flowing in the lower and upper atmosphere and supplying currents to the GEC. The role of aerosols and cosmic rays in controlling the GEC and linkage between climate, solarterrestrial relationships and the GEC has been briefly discussed. Some unsolved problems in this area are reported for future investigations.",Human
"We study the effects of a time-varying gravitomagnetic field on the motion of test particles. Starting from recent results, we consider the gravitomagnetic field of a source whose spin angular momentum has a linearly time-varying magnitude. The acceleration due to such a time-varying gravitomagnetic field is considered as a perturbation of the Newtonian motion, and we explicitly evaluate the effects of this perturbation on the Keplerian elements of a closed orbit. The theoretical predictions are compared with actual astronomical and astrophysical scenarios, both in the solar system and in binary pulsars systems, in order to evaluate the impact of these effects on real systems.",Human
"Patterns of convection in internally heated, self-gravitating rotating spherical fluid shells are investigated through numerical simulations. While turbulent states are of primary interest in planetary and stellar applications the present paper emphasizes more regular dynamical features at Rayleigh numbers not far above threshold which are similar to those which might be observed in laboratory or space experiments. Amplitude vacillations and spatial modulations of convection columns are common features at moderate and large Prandtl numbers. In the low Prandtl number regime equatorially attached convection evolves differently with increasing Rayleigh number and exhibits an early transition into a chaotic state. Relationships of the dynamical features to coherent structures in fully turbulent convection states are emphasized.",Human
"The paper discusses the affection of the scalar potential on the speed of light in the electromagnetic field, by means of the characteristics of octonion. In the octonion space, the radius vector is combined with the integral of field potentials to become one new radius vector. When the field potentials can not be neglected, the new radius vector will cause the prediction to departure slightly from the theoretical value of the speed of light. The results explain why the speed of light varies in diversiform optical waveguide. And there exist negative refractive indexes due to different scalar potentials in the gravitational field and electromagnetic field.",Human
"A simulation study of the magnetic electron drift vortex (MEDV) mode turbulence in a magnetoplasma in the presence of inhomogeneities in the plasma temperature and density, as well as in the external magnetic field, is presented. The study shows that the influence of the magnetic field inhomogeneity is to suppress streamer-like structures observed in previous simulation studies without background magnetic fields. The MEDV mode turbulence exhibits non-universal (non-Kolmogorov type) spectra for different sets of the plasma parameters. In the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, the spectrum changes to a 7/3 power law, which is flatter than without magnetic field gradients. The relevance of this work to laser-produced plasmas in the laboratory is briefly mentioned.",Human
"We present a method, based on noncollinear second harmonic generation, to evaluate the non-zero elements of the nonlinear optical susceptibility. At a fixed incidence angle, the generated signal is investigated by varying the polarization state of both fundamental beams. The resulting polarization charts allows to verify if Kleinman symmetry rules can be applied to a given material or to retrieve the absolute value of the nonlinear optical tensor terms, from a reference measurement. Experimental measurements obtained from Gallium Nitride layers are reported. The proposed method does not require an angular scan thus is useful when the generated signal is strongly affected by sample rotation",Human
"Electron-positron pair production is considered in the relativistic collision of a nucleus and an anti-nucleus, in which both leptons are created in bound states of the corresponding nucleus-lepton system. Compared to free and bound-free pair production this process is shown to display a qualitatively different dependency both on the impact energy and charged of the colliding particles. Interestingly, at high impact energies the cross section for this process is found to be larger than that for the analogous atomic process of non-radiative electron capture although the latter does not involve the creation of new particles.",Human
"We observe the statistical properties of blogs that are expected to reflect social human interaction. Firstly, we introduce a basic normalization preprocess that enables us to evaluate the genuine word frequency in blogs that are independent of external factors such as spam blogs, server-breakdowns, increase in the population of bloggers, and periodic weekly behaviors. After this process, we can confirm that small frequency words clearly follow an independent Poisson process as theoretically expected. Secondly, we focus on each blogger's basic behaviors. It is found that there are two kinds of behaviors of bloggers. Further, Zipf's law on word frequency is confirmed to be universally independent of individual activity types.",Human
"We have developed an interface which allows to perform rigorous electromagnetic field (EMF) simulations with the simulator JCMsuite and subsequent aerial imaging and resist simulations with the simulator Dr.LiTHO. With the combined tools we investigate the convergence of near-field and far-field results for different DUV masks. We also benchmark results obtained with the waveguide-method EMF solver included in Dr.LiTHO and with the finite-element-method EMF solver JCMsuite. We demonstrate results on convergence for dense and isolated hole arrays, for masks including diagonal structures, and for a large 3D mask pattern of lateral size 10 microns by 10 microns.",Human
Our understanding of earthquakes is based on the theory of plate tectonics. Earthquake dynamics is the study of the interactions of plates (solid disjoint parts of the lithosphere) which produce seismic activity. Over the last about fifty years many models have come up which try to simulate seismic activity by mimicking plate plate interactions. The validity of a given model is subject to the compliance of the synthetic seismic activity it produces to the well known empirical laws which describe the statistical features of observed seismic activity. Here we present a review of two such models of earthquake dynamics with main focus on a relatively new model namely The Two Fractal Overlap Model.,Human
"We demonstrate how the shape of femtosecond laser pulses can be tailored in order to obtain maximal ionization of atoms or molecules. For that purpose, we have overlayed a direct-optimization scheme on top of a fully unconstrained computation of the three-dimensional time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The procedure looks for pulses that maintain the same total length and integrated intensity or fluence as a given pulse that serves as an initial guess. It allows, however, for changes in frequencies -- within a certain, predefined range -- and overall shape, leading to enhanced ionization. We illustrate the scheme by calculating ionization yields for the H2+ molecule when irradiated with short (~5 fs), high-intensity laser pulses.",Human
"We have measured time-resolved the photon storage time and the quality factor of an ultrafast photonic cavity using an autocorrelator. The cavity consists of a $\lambda$-thick GaAs layer sandwiched between GaAs/AlAs distributed Bragg reflectors and resonates at 985 nm wavelength. The inverse relative linewidth measured with white light reflectivity is 830, while the quality factor obtained from the time resolved measurements is 1500. The photon storage time in the cavity is 0.78 ps. We show that the difference between the quality factor and the inverse relative linewidth results from inhomogeneous broadening of the microcavity resonance due to a spatial gradient in the cavity layer.",Human
"We present a fully {\it ab initio}, non-perturbative, time-dependent approach to describe single and double ionization of helium by proton and antiproton impact. A flexible and accurate finite-element discrete-variable-representation is applied to discretize the problem on the radial grid in spherical coordinates. Good agreement with the most recent experimental data for absolute angle-integrated cross sections is obtained over a wide range of incident projectile energies between 3 keV and 6 MeV. Furthermore, angle-differential cross sections for two-electron ejection are predicted for a proton impact energy of 6 MeV. Finally, the time evaluation of the ionization process is portrayed by displaying the electron density as a function of the projectile location.",Human
"In the present study we discuss several modeling issues of powder-snow avalanche flows. We take a two-fluid modeling paradigm. For the sake of simplicity, we will restrict our attention to barotropic equations. We begin the exposition by a compressible model with two velocities for each fluid. However, this model may become non-hyperbolic and thus, represents serious challenges for numerical methods. To overcome these issues, we derive a single velocity model as a result of a relaxation process. This model can be easily shown to be hyperbolic for any reasonable equation of state. Finally, an incompressible limit of this model is derived.",Human
We examine the stability of intense flat bunches in barrier buckets used in the Recycler. We consider some common stationary distributions and show that they would be unstable against rigid dipole oscillations. We then discuss an analytical model for the line density that best describes measured bunch profiles. We include space charge in this model to predict the bunch intensity at which Landau damping would be lost. The dependence of this threshold on the bunch length is studied and related to the results of an experimental study with shorter bunch lengths. The threshold for the microwave instability is estimated. These studies will be followed by more detailed numerical studies.,Human
We present a new scheme for a laser cooled Raman optical fiber amplifier. The heat generated in the process of stimulated Raman scattering is compensated for with laser cooling provided by anti-Stokes fluorescence of ytterbium ions doped in the core of the fiber. The device is pumped with two pump sources. One of the pump sources provides Raman amplification of the signal and does not interact with the ytterbium ions in the core of the fiber. The second pump provides laser cooling of the fiber with anti-Stokes fluorescence of the Yb3+ ions. The proper arrangement of Yb3+distribution can provide athermal performance of the device.,Human
"This contribution replies to H. M. Zhang's paper ""What Faster-than-traffic Characteristic Speeds Mean for Vehicular Traffic Flow"", which comments on the manuscript ""On the Controversy around Daganzo's Requiem for and Aw-Rascle's Resurrection of Second-Order Traffic Flow Models"" published in this issue of Eurpean Physical Journal B. The author clarifies several points and agrees that suitable experiments can be a way of deciding the controversy on the existence of propagation speeds faster than the speed of vehicles. Moreover, he proposes to aim at an integrated theory, which is both, theoretically consistent and practically relevant.",Human
"A sensor web is a collection of heterogeneous sensors which autonomously reacts to the observed environment. The SouthEast Alaska MOnitoring Network for Science, Technology, Education, and Research (SEAMONSTER) project has implemented a sensor web in partially glaciated watersheds near Juneau, Alaska, on the edge of the Juneau Icefield. By coupling the SEAMONSTER sensor web with digital earth technologies the scientific utility, education and public outreach efforts, and sensor web management of the project all greatly benefit. This paper describes the scientific motivation for a sensor web, the technology developed to implement the sensor web, the software developed to couple the sensor web with digital earth technologies, and demonstrates the SEAMONSTER sensor web in a digital earth framework.",Human
"Non-relativisitic second-order corrections to the wave function at origin in muonic and exotic atoms are considered. The corrections are due to the electronic vacuum polarization. Such corrections are of interest due to various effective approaches, which take into account QED and hadronic effects. The wave function at origin plays a key role in the calculation of the pionium lifetime, various finite nuclear size effects and the hyperfine splitting. The results are obtained for the $1s$ and $2s$ states in pionic and muonic hydrogen and deuterium and in pionium, a bound system of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$. Applications to the hyperfine structure and the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen are also considered.",Human
"We study some spring mass models for a structure having a unilateral spring of small rigidity $\epsilon$. We obtain and justify an asymptotic expansion with the method of strained coordinates with new tools to handle such defects, including a non negligible cumulative effect over a long time: $T_\eps \sim \eps^{-1}$ as usual; or, for a new critical case, we can only expect: $T_\eps \sim \eps^{-1/2}$. We check numerically these results and present a purely numerical algorithm to compute ""Non linear Normal Modes"" (NNM); this algorithm provides results close to the asymptotic expansions but enables to compute NNM even when $\epsilon$ becomes larger.",Human
"We re-examine past suggestions of a close link between terrestrial climate change and the Sun's transit of spiral arms in its path through the Milky Way galaxy. These links produced concrete fits, deriving the unknown spiral pattern speed from terrestrial climate correlations. We test these fits against new data on spiral structure based on CO data that does not make simplifying assumptions about symmetry and circular rotation. If we compare the times of these transits to changes in the climate of Earth, not only do the claimed correlations disappear, but also we find that they cannot be resurrected for any reasonable pattern speed.",Human
"Dynamic fracture experiments were performed in PMMA over a wide range of velocities and reveal that the fracture energy exhibits an abrupt 3-folds increase from its value at crack initiation at a well-defined critical velocity, below the one associated to the onset of micro-branching instability. This transition is associated with the appearance of conics patterns on fracture surfaces that, in many materials, are the signature of damage spreading through the nucleation and growth of microcracks. A simple model allows to relate both the energetic and fractographic measurements. These results suggest that dynamic fracture at low velocities in amorphous materials is controlled by the brittle/quasi-brittle transition studied here.",Human
"Single vehicle data obtained from magnetic loops on an expressway allowed us to measure velocity correlations and velocity differences between non--neighbor vehicles on the same lane, showing some strong correlations even for platoons of 7 or 8 vehicles. The corresponding time headway distribution for non--neighbor vehicles is also presented. We were also able to get some informations about inter--lane structures, through crossed time headway distributions. It should be noticed that these last results on crossed time headways are meaningful only because the subset of data we used corresponds to a unique stationary traffic state -- and still contains a large amount of data, with a large fraction of short time headways. The link with passing maneuvers is discussed.",Human
"A strong inhomogeneous static electric field is used to spatially disperse a rotationally cold supersonic beam of 2,6-difluoroiodobenzene molecules according to their rotational quantum state. The molecules in the lowest lying rotational states are selected and used as targets for 3-dimensional alignment and orientation. The alignment is induced in the adiabatic regime with an elliptically polarized, intense laser pulse and the orientation is induced by the combined action of the laser pulse and a weak static electric field. We show that the degree of 3-dimensional alignment and orientation is strongly enhanced when rotationally state-selected molecules, rather than molecules in the original molecular beam, are used as targets.",Human
"We are used to describe the detection of light in terms of particles and its propagation from the source to the detection, by waves. For instance, the slowing down of light in a transparent medium is always explained within the electromagnetic wave framework. We propose to approach that phenomenon through a purely corpuscular description. We find expression for the refractive indices which differ slightly from the usual Maxwell wave approach. We thus compare these expressions against experimental refractive indices and we show that both reproduce well the data. We show also how this corpuscular framework gives a very natural interpretation to the self focusing Kerr effect. Finally an experimental expectation of fluctuation of the speed of light is presented.",Human
"The aim of this study is to assess the performances of the global optimisation (GO) method (Bone position estimation from skin marker co-ordinates using GO with joint constraints. Journal of Biomechanics 32, 129-134) within the upper limb kinematics analysis. First the model of the upper limb is presented. Then we apply GO method in order to reduce skin movement artefacts that imply relative movement between markers and bones. The performances of the method are then evaluated with the help of simulated movements of the upper limb. Results show a significant reduction of the errors and of the variability due to skin movement.",Human
"After describing Bhabha's early life at Bombay, now Mumbai, we discuss his research career at Cambridge, where he made many distinguished contributions to positron physics, cosmic rays and the meson theory. These include theory of positron-electron scattering (Bhabha scattering), Bhabha-Heitler theory of cosmic ray showers and prediction of heavier electrons (ie. muons). Later in his life, after 1945, Bhabha worked in India at Bangalore and Mumbai. In India Bhabha laid foundations of modern nuclear science and technology. He emerged as a successful institution builder founding Tata Institute of Fundamental Research at Mumbai and the Laboratories of Atomic Energy Establishment at Trombay, now renamed as Bhabha Atomic Research Center.",Human
"We report a method for estimating people's achievement based on their fame. Earlier we discovered (cond-mat/0310049) that fame of fighter pilot aces (measured as number of Google hits) grows exponentially with their achievement (number of victories). We hypothesize that the same functional relation between achievement and fame holds for other professions. This allows us to estimate achievement for professions where an unquestionable and universally accepted measure of achievement does not exist. We apply the method to Nobel Prize winners in Physics. For example, we obtain that Paul Dirac, who is hundred times less famous than Einstein contributed to physics only two times less. We compare our results with Landau's ranking.",Human
"A crab cavity is required in the CLIC to allow effective head-on collision of bunches at the IP. A high operating frequency is preferred as the deflection voltage required for a given rotation angle and the RF phase tolerance for a crab cavity are inversely proportional to the operating frequency. The short bunch spacing of the CLIC scheme and the high sensitivity of the crab cavity to dipole kicks demand very high damping of the inter-bunch wakes, the major contributor to the luminosity loss of colliding bunches. This paper investigates the nature of the wakefields in the CLIC crab cavity and the possibility of using various damping schemes to suppress them effectively.",Human
"We present a detailed analysis and comparison of dielectric waveguides made of CdTe, GaP, GaAs and InP for modal phase matched optical difference frequency generation (DFG) in the terahertz domain. From the form of the DFG equations, we derived the definition of a very general figure of merit (FOM). In turn, this FOM enabled us to compare different configurations, by taking into account linear and nonlinear susceptibility dispersion, terahertz absorption, and a rigorous evaluation of the waveguide modes properties. The most efficient waveguides found with this procedure are predicted to approach the quantum efficiency limit with input optical power in the order of kWs.",Human
"We address the stability of light bullets supported by Bessel optical lattices with out-of-phase modulation of the linear and nonlinear refractive indices. We show that spatial modulation of the nonlinearity significantly modifies the shapes and stability domains of the light bullets. The addressed bullets can be stable, provided that the peak intensity does not exceed a critical value. We show that the width of the stability domain in terms of the propagation constant may be controlled by varying the nonlinearity modulation depth. In particular, we show that the maximum energy of the stable bullets grows with increasing nonlinearity modulation depth.",Human
"We propose a new model-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for tumor detection and classification (cancerous v.s. benign) in breast images. Specifically, we show that (x-ray, ultrasound and MRI) images can be accurately modeled by two-dimensional autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) random fields. We derive a two-stage Yule-Walker Least-Squares estimates of the model parameters, which are subsequently used as the basis for statistical inference and biophysical interpretation of the breast image. We use a k-means classifier to segment the breast image into three regions: healthy tissue, benign tumor, and cancerous tumor. Our simulation results on ultrasound breast images illustrate the power of the proposed approach.",Human
"We present numerical simulations of the magnetic field generated by the flow of liquid sodium driven by two counter-rotating impellers (VKS experiment). Using a dynamo kinematic code in cylindrical geometry, it is shown that different magnetic modes can be generated depending on the flow configuration. While the time averaged axisymmetric mean flow generates an equatorial dipole, our simulations show that an axial field of either dipolar or quadrupolar symmetry can be generated by taking into account non-axisymmetric components of the flow. Moreover, we show that by breaking a symmetry of the flow, the magnetic field becomes oscillatory. This leads to reversals of the axial dipole polarity, involving a competition with the quadrupolar component.",Human
A wave model for the interconversion of photon particle behavior and wave phenomena is examined in relation to the adiabatic spatial expansion of the Universe. An historical perspective of the mathematics of physical science over the 20th century between what are termed phenomenal and noumenal are contrasted based on quotations from leading scholars. The question is posed whether the generation of space is an energetic sink and should be included in the conservation of energy as posited by the First Law of Thermodynamics. Various aspects of space expansion and electromagnetic radiation are examined as well as a mechanism based on imaginary conmponents to real space dimensions and the consequent creation of the time dimension.,Human
"We discuss the influence of a single or double fullerenes shell upon photoionization and vacancy decay of an atom, stuffed inside the fullerenes construction. The main manifestations of this influence are additional structures in the photoionization cross-section and variation of the vacancy decay probability. The main mechanisms, with which fullerenes shells affect the processes in caged atoms is the scattering of the outgoing electrons by the fullerenes shell and modification of the photon beam due to fullerenes shell polarization. General consideration will be illustrated by numeric calculations where C60 and C240 will be chosen as fullerenes and Ar and Xe as caged atoms.",Human
"We present a general analysis of the influence of nonlinear optical absorption on terahertz generation via optical difference frequency generation, when reaching for the quantum conversion efficiency limit. By casting the equations governing the process in a suitably normalized form, including either two-photon- or three-photon-absorption terms, we have been able to plot universal charts for phase matched optical-to-terahertz conversion for different values of the nonlinear absorption coefficients. We apply our analysis to some experiments reported to date, in order to understand to what extent multiphoton absorption could have played a role and also to predict the maximum achievable conversion efficiency at higher peak pump intensities.",Human
In order to assess the performance of liquid xenon detectors for use in positron emission tomography we studied the scintillation light and ionization charge produced by 511 keV photons in a small prototype detector. Scintillation light was detected with large area avalanche photodiodes while ionization electrons were collected on an anode instrumented with low noise electronics after drifting up to 3 cm. Operational conditions were studied as a function of the electric field. Energy resolutions of <10 % (FWHM) were achieved by combining the scintillation light and ionization charge signals. The relationship between scintillation light and ionization signals was investigated. An analysis of the sources of fluctuations was performed in order to optimize future detector designs.,Human
"A large part of the experimental program in Hall B of the Jefferson Lab is dedicated to baryon spectroscopy. Photoproduction experiments are essential part of this program. CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) and availability of circularly and linearly polarized tagged photon beams provide unique conditions for this type of experiments. Recent addition of the Frozen Spin Target (FROST) gives a remarkable opportunity to measure double and triple polarization observables for different pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction processes. For the first time, a complete or nearly complete experiment becomes possible and will allow model independent extraction of the reaction amplitude. An overview of the experiment and its current status is presented.",Human
"Five new correlations between sunspot activity and orbiting position of the Jovian planets are detected. In order to explain these correlations it is suggested that the resonance of the outer planets destabilizes the orbit of Kuiper Belt Objects and generates a cyclical impact frequency on the Sun. The vaporization of the object initiates a shock way disrupting the upwelling of the plasma resulting in a sunspot formation. The proposed model is able to explain the length of the cycle, the latitude distribution of the sunspots and the extremely long term stability of the cycles. Calculating the positions of the Jovian planets at conjunction and opposition allows the long term prediction of the solar activity.",Human
"The existence of definite orders in frustrated quantum systems is related rigorously to the occurrence of fully factorized ground states below a threshold value of the frustration. Ground-state separability thus provides a natural measure of frustration: strongly frustrated systems are those that cannot accommodate for classical-like solutions. The exact form of the factorized ground states and the critical frustration are determined for various classes of nonexactly solvable spin models with different spatial ranges of the interactions. For weak frustration, the existence of disentangling transitions determines the range of applicability of mean-field descriptions in biological and physical problems such as stochastic gene expression and the stability of long-period modulated structures.",Human
"We model the mobility of mobile phone users to study the fundamental spreading patterns characterizing a mobile virus outbreak. We find that while Bluetooth viruses can reach all susceptible handsets with time, they spread slowly due to human mobility, offering ample opportunities to deploy antiviral software. In contrast, viruses utilizing multimedia messaging services could infect all users in hours, but currently a phase transition on the underlying call graph limits them to only a small fraction of the susceptible users. These results explain the lack of a major mobile virus breakout so far and predict that once a mobile operating system's market share reaches the phase transition point, viruses will pose a serious threat to mobile communications.",Human
"In this letter, we report on all-optical fiber approach to the generation of ultra-low noise microwave signals. We make use of two erbium fiber mode-locked lasers phase locked to a common ultra-stable laser source to generate an 11.55 GHz signal with an unprecedented relative phase noise of -111 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz from the carrier.The residual frequency instability of the microwave signals derived from the two optical frequency combs is below 2.3 10^(-16) at 1s and about 4 10^(-19) at 6.5 10^(4)s (in 5 Hz bandwidth, three days continuous operation).",Human
"The femtosecond response of NO-doped rare gas matrices is studied within a stochastic Langevin theoretical framework. As is shown, a simple damped harmonic oscillator model can describe properly the absorption and emission line shapes associated with the NO ($A^2\Sigma^+ \longleftrightarrow X^2\Pi$) electronic transitions inside these media as well as the matrix first-solvation shell response in a process with two timescales, finding a fairly good agreement with available experimental data. This approach thus constitutes an alternative and complementary way to analyze the structural relaxation dynamics of systems in liquids and solids, leading to a better understanding of the underlying physics.",Human
"The development of instruments for remote sensing applications (active or passive) requires in situ validation measurements. The equipments (radar or radiometer) must be tested on real geological profiles. We must have accurate information on the profiles studied (permittivity, humidity, thickness of layers ...). Sensors (humidity), samples (thickness) or laboratory measurements (permittivity) provide local data about the profile while the remote sensing equipment is performing global measurements on a geological structure. The present work describes an in situ characterization bench test, based on two horn antennas, associated with an identification profiles software we developed to obtain comprehensive and instantaneous information on the geological profiles.",Human
"We report new measurements and simulations of laser-induced fluorescence in ultracold neutral plasmas. We focus on the earliest times, when the plasma equilibrium is evolving and before the plasma expands. In the simulation, the ions interact via the Yukawa potential in a small cell with wrapped boundary conditions. We solve the optical Bloch equation for each ion in the simulation as a function of time. Both the simulation and experiment show the initial Bloch vector rotation, disorder-induced heating, and coherent oscillation of the rms ion velocity. Detailed modeling of the fluorescence signal makes it possible to use fluorescence spectroscopy to probe ion dynamics in ultracold and strongly coupled plasmas.",Human

Written in Perl, and using the SCPI protocol, enabled instruments can be easily programmed to perform a wide variety of tasks.

"Stimulated emission in small-molecule organic films at a high dye concentration is generally hindered by fluorescence quenching, especially in the red region of the spectrum. Here we demonstrate the achievement of high net gains (up to 50 cm-1) around 640 nm in thermally evaporated non-doped films of 4-di(4'-tert-butylbiphenyl-4-yl)amino-4'-dicyanovinylbenzene, which makes this material suitable for green-light pumped single-mode organic lasers with low threshold and superior stability.

"Here, an analytical version of numerical results is obtained in case of considering the laminar non-turbulent limit, of a twisted Riemannian thin flux tube. It is shown that the magnetic field is amplified, when electric current helicity and Riemann curvature are both negative. Thus spaces of positive and negative Riemannian curvatures seems to support dynamo action inside the torus, and not only negative Riemannian curvature surfaces as happens in 2D dynamos. New features appear in ${\alpha}^{2}$-dynamo twisted flow, using the approximation of thin tubes flux tubes. These solutions are obtained in the resonant profile of the toroidal and poloidal frequencies modes of the dynamo force-free flow.",Human
"We explore the effects of over-specificity in learning algorithms by investigating the behavior of a student, suited to learn optimally from a teacher $\mathbf{B}$, learning from a teacher $\mathbf{B}'\neq\mathbf{B}$. We only considered the supervised, on-line learning scenario with teachers selected from a particular family. We found that, in the general case, the application of the optimal algorithm to the wrong teacher produces a residual generalization error, even if the right teacher is harder. By imposing mild conditions to the learning algorithm form we obtained an approximation for the residual generalization error. Simulations carried in finite networks validate the estimate found.",Human
"By combining the results from a self-consistent 2D dusty plasma fluid model and a 3D N-body code, the equilibrium position and crystal structure were determined for dust particles levitated in the sheath in a modified Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) reference cell, in which the lower electrode was heated or cooled. The Debye length, charge and electric field were reconstructed on a sub-millimeter scale by applying a previously developed, independent method. However, this method seems to overestimate the charge, and hence underestimate the electric field. Even corrected for this fact, the results show that the dust is levitated on the plasma side of the Bohm point. The ion drag, which is not fully taken into.",Human
"A two-dimensional dust crystal levitated in the sheath of a modified Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) reference cell is manipulated by heating or cooling the lower electrode. The dust charge is obtained from top-view pictures of the crystal using a previously developed analytical model. By assuming a simple force balance, and measuring the radial confining force, the vertical electric field profile in the sheath is reconstructed. The dust crystal is shown to levitate on the plasma side of the Bohm point. Finally, it is shown that the ion drag plays an important role in the vertical force balance, even for large dust grains.",Human
"Electromagnetic negative refraction in metamaterials has attracted increasingly great interest, since its first experimental verification in 2001. It potentially leads to the applications superior to conventional devices including compact antennas for mobile stations, imaging beyond the diffraction limit, and high-resolution radars, not to mention the anamolous wave propagation in fundamental optics. Here, we report how metamaterials could be used to simulate the ""negative refraction of spin-zero particles interacting with a strong potential barrier"", which gives rise to the Klein paradox--a counterintuitive relativistic process. We address the underlying physics of analogous wave propagation behaviours in those two entirely different domains of quantum and classical.",Human
"Subjecting a solution of 228Th to ultrasound (20 kHz, 100W), Cardone et al. [Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 1956] claim to observe an increase in the transformation or decay rate of 228Th by a factor of 104. The evidence provided seems however far from conclusive and in part contradictory to the claims made. In fact, looking at the presented data we find it cannot be taken as justification to discard the null hypothesis, namely, that the data from exposed and non exposed samples are drawn from the same distribution. We suggest a number of additional tests that should be made in order to improve the quality of the study and test the hypothesis of so-called piezonuclear reactions.",Human
"We present an update of the ""refractive index of air"" experiment commonly used in optics and undergraduate advanced labs. The refractive index of air is based on the average molecular polarizability, which we measured from the period of the phase shift in a Michelson interferometer as a function of pressure. Our value of the average molecular polarizability of air is \gamma_mol = 2.133 \pm 0.032 \times 10^{-29} m^3 (95% CI) and from this we find the refractive index of air at atmospheric pressure to be n = 1.0002651(66), which is in agreement with the accepted value of n=1.000271375(6).",Human
"We present a computational scheme allowing for a self-consistent treatment of a dispersive metallic photonic metamaterial coupled to a gain material incorporated into the nanostructure. The gain is described by a generic four-level system. A critical pumping rate exists for compensating the loss of the metamaterial. Nonlinearities arise due to gain depletion beyond a certain critical strength of a test field. Transmission, reflection, and absorption data as well as the retrieved effective parameters are presented for a lattice of resonant square cylinders embedded in layers of gain material and split ring resonators with gain material embedded into the gaps.",Human
"We design three-dimensional (3D) metallic nanowire media with different structures and numerically demonstrate that they can be homogeneous effective indefinite anisotropic media by showing that their dispersion relations are hyperbolic. For a finite slab, a nice fitting procedure is exploited to obtain the dispersion relations from which we retrieve the effective permittivities. The pseudo focusing for the real 3D wire medium agrees very well with the homogeneous medium having the effective permittivity tensor of the wire medium. Studies also show that in the long-wavelength limit, the hyperbolic dispersion relation of the 3D wire medium can be valid even for evanescent modes.",Human
This paper presents a least mean square (LMS) algorithm for the joint estimation of acoustic and mean flow velocities from laser doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements. The usual algorithms used for measuring with LDV purely acoustic velocity or mean flow velocity may not be used when the acoustic field is disturbed by a mean flow component. The LMS-based algorithm allows accurate estimations of both acoustic and mean flow velocities. The Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of the associated problem is determined. The variance of the estimators of both acoustic and mean flow velocities is also given. Simulation results of this algorithm are compared with the CRB and the comparison leads to validate this estimator.,Human
"An experiment using a prototype setup to search for the neutron electric dipole moment by measuring spin-rotation in a non-centrosymmetric crystal (quartz) was carried out to investigate statistical sensitivity and systematic effects of the method. It has been demonstrated that the concept of the method works. The preliminary result of the experiment is $d_{\rm n}=(2.5\pm 6.5)\cdot 10^{-24}$ e$\cdot $cm. The experiment showed that an accuracy of $\sim 2.5\cdot 10^{-26}$ e$\cdot $cm can be obtained in 100 days data taking, using available quartz crystals and neutron beams.",Human
"We argue that certain assumptions about the process of the emission of the quanta by their (oscillating) emitter provide for their changing (oscillatory) flux at any location. This mechanism underlying (such) wave phenomena is not based, both, on the newtonian notion of force and the field concept (of Faraday, Maxwell, Lorentz and Einstein). When applied to the case of thermal radiation, this emission origin for the wave of quanta is shown here to be consistent with the laws of the black body radiation. We conclude therefore also that a conceptual framework, which is not rooted in the notion of force and in the field concept, may provide a deterministic basis underlying the probabilistic methods of the quantum theory.",Human
"We study stochastic processes that generate non-growing complex networks without self-loops and multiple edges (simple graphs). The work concentrates on understanding and formulation of constraints which keep the rewiring stochastic processes within the class of simple graphs. To formulate these constraints a new concept of wedge distribution (paths of length 2) is introduced and its relation to degree-degree correlation is studied. The analysis shows that the constraints, together with edge selection rules, do not even allow to formulate a closed master equation in the general case. We also introduce a particular stochastic process which does not contain edge selection rules, but which, we believe, can provide some insight into the complexities of simple graphs.",Human
This paper presents an application of time-frequency methods to characterize the dispersion of acoustic waves travelling in a one-dimensional periodic or disordered lattice made up of Helmholtz resonators connected to a cylindrical tube. These methods allow (1) to evaluate the velocity of the wave energy when the input signal is an acoustic pulse ; (2) to display the evolution of the spectral content of the transient signal ; (3) to show the role of the localized nonlinearities on the propagation .i.e the emergence of higher harmonics. The main result of this paper is that the time-frequency methods point out how the nonlinearities break the localization of the waves and/or the filter effects of the lattice.,Human
"We define a model microswimmer with a variable cycle time, thus allowing the possibility of phase locking driven by hydrodynamic interactions between swimmers. We find that, for extensile or contractile swimmers, phase locking does occur, with the relative phase of the two swimmers being, in general, close to 0 or pi, depending on their relative position and orientation. We show that, as expected on grounds of symmetry, self T-dual swimmers, which are time-reversal covariant, do not phase-lock. We also discuss the phase behaviour of a line of tethered swimmers, or pumps. These show oscillations in their relative phases reminiscent of the metachronal waves of cilia.",Human
"Complexity science affords a number of novel tools for examining terrorism, particularly network analysis and NK-Boolean fitness landscapes. The following paper explores various aspects of terrorist networks which can be illuminated through applications of non-linear dynamical systems modeling to terrorist network structures. Of particular interest are some of the emergent properties of terrorist networks as typified by the 9-11 hijackers network, properties of centrality, hierarchy and distance, as well as ways in which attempts to disrupt the transmission of information through terrorist networks may be expected to produce greater or lesser levels of fitness in those organizations.",Human
"The experimental demonstration and characterization is made of the plasmon-mediated resonant transmission through an embedded undulated continuous thin metal film under normal incidence. 1D undulations are shown to enable a spatially resolved polarisation filtering whereas 2D undulations lead to spatially resolved, polarization independent transmission. Whereas the needed submicron microstructure lends itself in principle to CD-like low-cost mass replication by means of injection moulding and embossing, the present paper demonstrates the expected transmission effects on experimental models based on metal-coated photoresist gratings. The spectral and angular dependence in the neighbourhood of resonance are investigated and the question of the excess losses exhibited by surface plasmons is discussed",Human
"The dielectric susceptibility of most materials follows a fractional power-law frequency dependence that is called the ""universal"" response. We prove that in the time domain this dependence gives differential equations with derivatives and integrals of noninteger order. We obtain equations that describe ""universal"" Curie-von Schweidler and Gauss laws for such dielectric materials. These laws are presented by fractional differential equations such that the electromagnetic fields in the materials demonstrate ""universal"" fractional damping. The suggested fractional equations are common (universal) to a wide class of materials, regardless of the type of physical structure, chemical composition or of the nature of the polarization.",Human
"The optical trapping of polymeric nanofibers and the characterization of the rotational dynamics are reported. A strategy to apply a torque to a polymer nanofiber, by tilting the trapped fibers using a symmetrical linear polarized Gaussian beam is demonstrated. Rotation frequencies up to 10 Hz are measured, depending on the trapping power, the fiber length and the tilt angle. A comparison of the experimental rotation frequencies in the different trapping configurations with calculations based on optical trapping and rotation of linear nanostructures through a T-Matrix formalism, accurately reproduce the measured data, providing a comprehensive description of the trapping and rotation dynamics.",Human
"Despite the observational evidence that the Universe appears hierarchically structured up to a distance of at least 30 Mpc/h (and possibly up to 100 Mpc/h), the fractal paradigm has not yet been recognized by the majority of cosmologists today. In this work we provide a brief overview of the recent observational and theoretical advances relevant to the question of the global cosmic structure and present some simple calculations which indicate how the hierarchical structure may pass over to the homogeneous Universe at very large scale. We show that the fractal structure may be derived from the moderately nonuniform matter distribution. We address a number of epistemological questions relevant to a general outlook of the Cosmos at large too.",Human
"The dielectric susceptibility of a wide class of dielectric materials follows, over extended frequency ranges, a fractional power-law frequency dependence that is called the ""universal"" response. The electromagnetic fields in such dielectric media are described by fractional differential equations with time derivatives of non-integer order. An exact solution of the fractional equations for a magnetic field is derived. The electromagnetic fields in the dielectric materials demonstrate fractional damping. The typical features of ""universal"" electromagnetic waves in dielectric are common to a wide class of materials, regardless of the type of physical structure, chemical composition, or of the nature of the polarizing species, whether dipoles, electrons or ions.",Human
"Linking the microscopic and macroscopic behavior is at the heart of many natural and social sciences. This apparent similarity conceals essential differences across disciplines: while physical particles are assumed to optimize the global energy, economic agents maximize their own utility. Here, we solve exactly a Schelling-like segregation model, which interpolates continuously between cooperative and individual dynamics. We show that increasing the degree of cooperativity induces a qualitative transition from a segregated phase of low utility towards a mixed phase of high utility. By introducing a simple function which links the individual and global levels, we pave the way to a rigorous approach of a wide class of systems, where dynamics is governed by individual strategies.",Human
"Recent clock experiments have measured density-dependent frequency shifts in polarized fermionic alkaline-earth atoms using 1S0-3P0 Rabi spectroscopy. Here we provide a first-principles non-equilibrium theoretical description of the interaction frequency shifts starting from the microscopic many-body Hamiltonian. Our formalism describes the dependence of the frequency shift on excitation inhomogeneity, interactions, and many-body dynamics, provides a fundamental understanding of the effects of the measurement process, and explains the observed density shift data. We also propose a method to measure the second of the two 1S0-3P0 scattering lengths, whose knowledge is essential for quantum information processing and quantum simulation applications.",Human
"This two-part paper presents a new approach to predictive analysis for social processes. Part I identifies a class of social processes, called positive externality processes, which are both important and difficult to predict, and introduces a multi-scale, stochastic hybrid system modeling framework for these systems. In Part II of the paper we develop a systems theory-based, computationally tractable approach to predictive analysis for these systems. Among other capabilities, this analytic methodology enables assessment of process predictability, identification of measurables which have predictive power, discovery of reliable early indicators for events of interest, and robust, scalable prediction. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated through case studies involving online markets, social movements, and protest behavior.",Human
"Using a time-gated dual quadrature spectral interferometry technique, for the first time we demonstrate single-shot characterization of both spectral amplitude and phase of ~1THz bandwidth optical arbitrary waveforms generated from a 10 GHz frequency comb. Our measurements provide a temporal resolution of 1ps over a record length of 100ps. Singleshot characterization becomes particularly relevant when waveform synthesis operations are updated at the repetition rate of the comb allowing creation of potentially infinite record length waveforms. We first demonstrate unambiguous single shot retrieval using rapidly updating waveforms. We then perform additional single-shot measurements of static user-defined waveforms generated via line-by-line pulse shaping.",Human
"We report non-invasive measurements of the complex field of elastic quasimodes of a silicon wafer with chaotic shape. The amplitude and phase spatial distribution of the flexural modes are directly obtained by Fourier transform of time measurements. We investigate the crossover from real mode to complex-valued quasimode, when absorption is progressively increased on one edge of the wafer. The complexness parameter, which characterizes the degree to which a resonance state is complex-valued, is measured for non-overlapping resonances and is found to be proportional to the non-homogeneous contribution to the line broadening of the resonance. A simple two-level model based on the effective Hamiltonian formalism supports our experimental results.",Human
"Chaos is an active research subject in the fields of science in recent years. it is a complex and an erratic behavior that is possible in very simple systems. in the present day, the chaotic behavior can be observed in experiments. Many studies have been made in chaotic dynamics during the past three decades and many simple chaotic systems have been discovered. in this work-bifurcations and chaos in simple dynamical systems - the behavior of some simple dynamical systems is studied by constructing mathematical models. investigations are made on the periodic orbits for continuous maps and idea of sensitive dependence on initial conditions,which is the hallmark of chaos, is obtained.",Human
"In this article we describe Professor, a new program for tuning model parameters of Monte Carlo event generators to experimental data by parameterising the per-bin generator response to parameter variations and numerically optimising the parameterised behaviour. Simulated experimental analysis data is obtained using the Rivet analysis toolkit. This paper presents the Professor procedure and implementation, illustrated with the application of the method to tunes of the Pythia 6 event generator to data from the LEP/SLD and Tevatron experiments. These tunes are substantial improvements on existing standard choices, and are recommended as base tunes for LHC experiments, to be themselves systematically improved upon when early LHC data is available.",Human
"A comparative study has been performed on Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) made of two different grades of bakelite paper laminates, produced and commercially available in India. The chambers, operated in the streamer mode using argon, tetrafluroethane and isobutane in 34:59:7 mixing ratio, are tested for the efficiency and the stability with cosmic rays. A particular grade of bakelite (P-120, NEMA LI-1989 Grade XXX), used for high voltage insulation in humid conditions, was found to give satisfactory performance with stable efficiency of > 96% continuously for more than 130 days. A thin coating of silicone fluid on the inner surfaces of the bakelite RPC is found to be necessary for operation of the detector.",Human
"We present experimental observations of strong electric and magnetic interactions between split ring resonators (SRRs) in metamaterials. We fabricated near-infrared (1.4 $\mu$m) planar metamaterials with different inter-SRR spacings along different directions. Our transmission measurements show blueshifts and redshifts of the magnetic resonance, depending on SRR orientation relative to the lattice. The shifts agree well with a simple model with simultaneous magnetic and electric near-field dipole coupling. We also find large broadening of the resonance, accompanied by a decrease in effective cross section per SRR with increasing density. These effects result from superradiant scattering. Our data shed new light on Lorentz-Lorenz approaches to metamaterials.",Human
"The radiation reaction problem for an electric charge moving in flat space-time of three dimensions is discussed. The divergences stemming from the pointness of the particle are studied. A consistent regularization procedure is proposed, which exploits the Poincar\'e invariance of the theory. Effective equation of motion of radiating charge in an external electromagnetic field is obtained via the consideration of energy-momentum and angular momentum conservation. This equation includes the effect of the particle's own field. The radiation reaction is determined by the Lorentz force of point-like charge acting upon itself plus a non-local term which provides finiteness of the self-action.",Human
"In this paper we investigate the properties of self induced transparency (SIT) solitons, propagating in a $\Lambda$-type medium. It was found that the interaction between SIT solitons can lead to trapping with their phase preserved in the ground state coherence of the medium. These phases can be altered in a systematic way by the application of appropriate light fields, such as additional SIT solitons. Furthermore, multiple independent SIT solitons can be made to propagate as bi-solitons through their mutual interaction with a separate light field. Finally, we demonstrate that control of the SIT soliton phase can be used to implement an optical exclusive-or gate.",Human
"A detailed analysis of the remainder obtained by truncating the Euler series up to the $n$th-order term is presented. In particular, by using an approach recently proposed by Weniger, asymptotic expansions of the remainder, both in inverse powers and in inverse rising factorials of $n$, are obtained. It is found that the corresponding expanding coefficients are expressed, in closed form, in terms of exponential polynomials, well known in combinatorics, and in terms of associated Laguerre polynomials, respectively. A study of the divergence and/or of the convergence of the above expansions is also carried out for positive values of the Euler series argument.",Human
"The aim of the thesis is to present and analyze two particular problems of transport in porous media flow. The first of them is related to the process of saturation of porous building materials. Recently, M. K\""untz and P. Laval\'ee, using a computer model of this process, have concluded that the anomalous diffusion assumption is correct. In this thesis I present an alternative explanation of this results without any refer to anomalous diffusion. The second part of the thesis covers the numerical analysis of the tortuosity of the flow -- one of a very interesting physical macroscopic variables characterizing transport in porous media.

"We report the first experimental observation of non-adiabatic field-free orientation of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule (CO) induced by an intense two-color (800 and 400 nm) femtosecond laser field. We monitor orientation by measuring fragment ion angular distributions after Coulomb explosion with an 800 nm pulse. The orientation of the molecules is controlled by the relative phase of the two-color field. The results are compared to quantum mechanical rigid rotor calculations. The demonstrated method can be applied to study molecular frame dynamics under field-free conditions in conjunction with a variety of spectroscopy methods, such as high-harmonic generation, electron diffraction and molecular frame photoemission.",Human
"Using a cold atomic gas exposed to laser pulses -- a realization of the chaotic quasiperiodic kicked rotor with three incommensurate frequencies -- we study experimentally and theoretically the Anderson metal-insulator transition in three dimensions. Sensitive measurements of the atomic wavefunction and the use of finite-size scaling techniques make it possible to unambiguously demonstrate the existence of a quantum phase transition and to measure its critical exponents. By taking proper account of systematic corrections to one-parameter scaling, we show the universality of the critical exponent $\nu=1.59\pm0.01,$ which is found to be equal to the one previously computed for the Anderson model.",Human
"Nodes in real-world networks are usually organized in local modules. These groups, called communities, are intuitively defined as sub-graphs with a larger density of internal connections than of external links. In this work, we introduce a new measure aimed at quantifying the statistical significance of single communities. Extreme and Order Statistics are used to predict the statistics associated with individual clusters in random graphs. These distributions allows us to define one community significance as the probability that a generic clustering algorithm finds such a group in a random graph. The method is successfully applied in the case of real-world networks for the evaluation of the significance of their communities.",Human
"We propose a new iterative unfolding method for experimental data, making use of a regularization function. The use of this function allows one to build an improved normalization procedure for Monte Carlo spectra, unbiased by the presence of possible new structures in data. We are able to unfold, in a dynamically stable way, data spectra which can be strongly affected by fluctuations in the background subtraction and simultaneously reconstruct structures which were not initially simulated. This method also allows one to control the amount of correlations introduced between the bins of the unfolded spectrum, when the transfers of events correcting the systematic detector effects are performed.",Human
"The LHCb experiment is shown to be ideal for studies of exclusive final states from central diffractive reactions. The gluon-rich environment of the central system allows detailed QCD studies and searches for exotic meson states, such as glueballs, molecules, hybrids and new charmonium-like states. It would also provide a good testing ground for detailed studies of heavy quarkonia. Due to its distinct design features, the LHCb can accurately measure the low-mass central systems with good purity. The efficiency of the FSC system for detecting rapidity gaps is shown to be adequate for the proposed studies. With this detector arrangement, valuable new data can be obtained by tagging central diffractive processes.",Human
"We study by computer simulation the ""Hawkes process"" that was proposed in a recent paper by Crane and Sornette (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 15649 (2008)) as a plausible model for the dynamics of YouTube video viewing numbers. We test the claims made there that robust identification is possible for classes of dynamic response following activity bursts. Our simulated timeseries for the Hawkes process indeed fall into the different categories predicted by Crane and Sornette. However the Hawkes process gives a much narrower spread of decay exponents than the YouTube data, suggesting limits to the universality of the Hawkes-based analysis.",Human
In this paper we present a review of the existing data on interferential mirror birefringence. We also report new measurements of two sets of mirrors that confirm that mirror phase retardation per reflection decreases when mirror reflectivity increases. We finally developed a computational code to calculate the expected phase retardation per reflection as a function of the total number of layers constituting the mirror. Different cases have been studied and we have compared computational results with the trend of the experimental data. Our study indicates that the origin of the mirror intrinsic birefringence can be ascribed to the reflecting layers close to the substrate.,Human
"Previous formulations of heating and transport associated with strong magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are generalized to incorporate separate internal energy equations for electrons and protons. Electron heat conduction is included. Energy is supplied by turbulent heating that affects both electrons and protons, and is exchanged between them via collisions. Comparison to available Ulysses data shows that a reasonable accounting for the data is provided when (i) the energy exchange timescale is very long and (ii) the deposition of heat due to turbulence is divided, with 60% going to proton heating and 40% into electron heating. Heat conduction, determined here by an empirical fit, plays a major role in describing the electron data.",Human
"Magnetic resonance coupling between connected split ring resonators (SRRs) and magnetic plasmon (MP) excitations in the connected SRR chains were theoretically studied. By changing the connection configuration, two different coupling behaviors were observed, and therefore two kinds of MP bands were formed in the connected ring chains, accordingly. These MPs were revealed with positive and negative dispersion for the homo- and anti-connected chain, respectively. Notably, these two MP modes both have wide bandwidth due to the conductive coupling. Moreover, the anti-connected chain is found supporting a novel negative propagating wave with a wide band starting from zero frequency, which is a fancy phenomenon in one-dimensional system.",Human
"We study random graph models for directed acyclic graphs, an important class of networks that includes citation networks, food webs, and feed-forward neural networks among others. We propose two specific models, roughly analogous to the fixed edge number and fixed edge probability variants of traditional undirected random graphs. We calculate a number of properties of these models, including particularly the probability of connection between a given pair of vertices, and compare the results with real-world acyclic network data finding that theory and measurements agree surprisingly well -- far better than the often poor agreement of other random graph models with their corresponding real-world networks.",Human
"In this Letter we present discrete wave turbulence (DWT) as a counterpart of classical statistical wave turbulence (SWT). DWT is characterized by resonance clustering, not by the size of clusters, i.e. it includes, but is not reduced to, the study of low-dimensional systems. Clusters with integrable and chaotic dynamics co-exist in different sub-spaces of the $\mathbf{k}$-space. NR-diagrams are introduced, a handy graphical presentation of an arbitrary resonance cluster allowing to reconstruct uniquely dynamical system describing the cluster. DWT is shown to be a novel research field in nonlinear science, with its own methods, achievements and application areas.",Human
"We consider the spin-exchange in ultracold collisions of hydrogen ($H$) and antihydrogen ($\bar{H}$) atoms. The cross sections for transitions between various hyperfine states are calculated. We show that the process of spin exchange in $\bar{H}-H$ collisions is basically driven by the strong force between proton and antiproton, that spin-exchange cross-sections are proportional to the difference of singlet and triplet strong force S-wave scattering lengths, while the strong force effects are enhanced about $10^9$ times due to long range atomic forces. We show that any difference in hyperfine structure of $H$ and $\bar{H}$ (CPT violation) manifests itself in radical change of spin-exchange cross-sections energy behavior.",Human
"A novel electromagnetic energy squeezing mechanism is proposed based on the special properties of permeability-near-zero metamaterials. Nearly no energy stream can enter a conventional dielectric region positioned inside a permeability-near-zero material. When a source is surrounded by a dielectric split ring (encloser with a gap opened), the electromagnetic energy generated by the source is forced to propagate through the gap. When the gap is narrow, the energy stream density becomes very large and makes the magnetic field enhanced drastically in the gap. The narrow gap can be long and bended. This provides us a method to obtain strong magnetic field without using resonance enhancement.",Human
"A novel model of biological organisms is advanced, treating an organism as a self-consistent system subject to a pathogen flux. The principal novelty of the model is that it describes not some parts, but a biological organism as a whole. The organism is modeled by a five-dimensional dynamical system. The organism homeostasis is described by the evolution equations for five interacting components: healthy cells, ill cells, innate immune cells, specific immune cells, and pathogens. The stability analysis demonstrates that, in a wide domain of the parameter space, the system exhibits robust structural stability. There always exist four stable stationary solutions characterizing four qualitatively differing states of the organism: alive state, boundary state, critical state, and dead state.",Human
"We consider a class of Boussinesq systems of Bona-Smith type in two space dimensions approximating surface wave flows modelled by the three-dimensional Euler equations. We show that various initial-boundary-value problems for these systems, posed on a bounded plane domain are well posed locally in time. In the case of reflective boundary conditions, the systems are discretized by a modified Galerkin method which is proved to converge in $L^2$ at an optimal rate. Numerical experiments are presented with the aim of simulating two-dimensional surface waves in complex plane domains with a variety of initial and boundary conditions, and comparing numerical solutions of Bona-Smith systems with analogous solutions of the BBM-BBM system.",Human
"We present a scheme of XOR/XNOR logic gate, based on non phase-matched noncollinear second harmonic generation from a medium of suitable crystalline symmetry, Gallium nitride. The polarization of the noncollinear generated beam is a function of the polarization of both pump beams, thus we experimentally investigated all possible polarization combinations, evidencing that only some of them are allowed and that the nonlinear interaction of optical signals behaves as a polarization based XOR. The experimental results show the peculiarity of the nonlinear optical response associated with noncollinear excitation, and are explained using the expression for the effective second order optical nonlinearity in noncollinear scheme.",Human
"An experimental investigation is made of sub-recoil cooling by velocity selective coherent population trapping in a two-level system in Sr. The experiment is carried out using the narrow linewidth intercombination line at 689 nm. Here, the ratio between the recoil shift and the linewidth is as high as 0.64. We show that, on top of a broader momentum profile, subrecoil features develop, whose amplitude is strongly dependent on the detuning from resonance. We attribute this structure to a velocity selective coherent population trapping mechanism. We also show that the population trapping phenomenon leads to complex momentum profiles in the case of highly saturated transitions, displaying a multitude of subrecoil features at integer multiples of the recoil momentum.",Human
Which non-local hidden variables could complement the description of physical reality? The present model of extended Newtonian dynamics (MEND) is generalize but not alternative to Newtonian Dynamics because its extended Newtonian Dynamics to arbitrary reference frames. It Is Physics of Arbitrary Reference Frames. Generalize and alternative is not the same. MEND describes the dynamics of mechanical systems for arbitrary reference frames and not only for inertial reference frames as Newtonian Dynamics. Newtonian Dynamics can describe non-inertial reference frames as well introducing fiction forces. In MEND we have fiction forces naturally and automatically from new axiomatic and we needn't have inertial reference frame. MEND is differs from Newtonian Dynamics in the case of micro-objects description.,Human
"We present a simple analysis of the force noise associated with the mechanical damping of the motion of a test body surrounded by a large volume of rarefied gas. The calculation is performed considering the momentum imparted by inelastic collisions against the sides of a cubic test mass, and for other geometries for which the force noise could be an experimental limitation. In addition to arriving at an accurated estimate, by two alternative methods, we discuss the limits of the applicability of this analysis to realistic experimental configurations in which a test body is surrounded by residual gas inside an enclosure that is only slightly larger than the test body itself.",Human
"Laser assisted photoemission by a chirped subfemtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse is considered within an exactly solvable quantum-mechanical model. Special emphasis is given to the energy dependence of photoexcitation cross-section. The streaked spectra are analyzed within the classical picture of initial time-momentum distribution r_ini(p,t) of photoelectrons mapped to the final energy scale. The actual time-momentum distribution in the absence of the probe laser field is shown to be a poor choice for r_ini, and a more adequate ansatz is suggested. The semiclassical theory offers a simple practically useful approximation for streaked spectra. Its limitations for sufficiently long chirped XUV pulses are established.",Human
"We have succeeded to develop a model pair interaction which when added to a system of interacting particles can be tuned to arrange the interacting objects into sheets. The interaction is based on the decomposition of the dipole-dipole interaction into two components, one parallel and one perpendicular to the connecting line between the dipoles, and keeping only perpendicular part here. Various aspects of this simple interaction are discussed, in particular in connection to two recent papers on self assembly of carbon nanostructures. On the other hand, the features discussed are quite general and might be of interest in different areas of microscopic modeling.",Human
"The measurement of the efficiency of an event selection is always an important part of the analysis of experimental data. The statistical techniques which are needed to determine the efficiency and its uncertainty are reviewed. Frequentist and Bayesian approaches are illustrated, and the problem of choosing a meaningful prior is explicitly addressed. Several practical use cases are considered, from the problem of combining different samples to complex situations in which non-unit weights or non-independent selections have been used. The Bayesian approach allows to find analytical expressions which solve even the most complicate problems, which make use of the family of Beta distributions, the conjugate priors for the binomial sampling.",Human
"Recently, the use of Bessel beams in evaluating the possibility of using them for a new generation of GPR (ground penetrating radar) systems has been considered. Therefore, an analysis of the propagation of Bessel beam in conducting media is worthwhile. We present here an analysis of this type. Specifically, for normal incidence we analyze the propagation of a Bessel beam coming from a perfect dielectric and impinging on a conducting medium, i.e. the propagation of a Bessel beam generated by refracted inhomogeneous waves. The remarkable and unexpected result is that the incident Bessel beam does not change its shape even when propagating in the conducting medium.",Human
"We have achieved Bose-Einstein condensation of $^{40}$Ca, the first for an alkaline earth element. The influence of elastic and inelastic collisions associated with the large ground state s-wave scattering length of $^{40}$Ca was measured. From these findings, an optimized loading and cooling scheme was developed that allowed us to condense about $2 \cdot 10^4$ atoms after laser cooling in a two-stage magneto-optical trap and subsequent forced evaporation in a crossed dipole trap within less than 3 s. The condensation of an alkaline earth element opens novel opportunities for precision measurements on the narrow intercombination lines as well as investigations of molecular states at the $^1$S--$^3$P asymptotes.",Human
"Bursty transport phenomena associated with convective motion present universal statistical characteristics among different physical systems. In this letter, a stochastic univariate model and the associated probability distribution function for the description of bursty transport in plasma turbulence is presented. The proposed stochastic process recovers the universal distribution of density fluctuations observed in plasma edge of several magnetic confinement devices and the remarkable scaling between their skewness $S$ and kurtosis $K$. Similar statistical characteristics of variabilities have been also observed in other physical systems that are characterized by convection such as the X-ray fluctuations emitted by the Cygnus X-1 accretion disc plasmas and the sea surface temperature fluctuations.",Human
"In this work we propose a new approach for the numerical simulation of kinetic equations through Monte Carlo schemes. We introduce a new technique which permits to reduce the variance of particle methods through a matching with a set of suitable macroscopic moment equations. In order to guarantee that the moment equations provide the correct solutions, they are coupled to the kinetic equation through a non equilibrium term. The basic idea, on which the method relies, consists in guiding the particle positions and velocities through moment equations so that the concurrent solution of the moment and kinetic models furnishes the same macroscopic quantities.",Human
"We demonstrate a frequency-stabilized, all-solid laser source at 589 nm with up to 800 mW output power. The laser relies on sum-frequency generation from two laser sources at 1064 nm and 1319 nm through a PPKTP crystal in a doubly-resonant cavity. We obtain conversion efficiency as high as 2 W/W^2 after optimization of the cavity parameters. The output wavelength is tunable over 60 GHz, which is sufficient to lock on the Sodium D2 line. The robustness, beam quality, spectral narrowness and tunability of our source make it an alternative to dye lasers for atomic physics experiments with Sodium atoms.",Human
"We develop a simple theoretical framework for the evolution of weighted networks that is consistent with a number of stylized features of real-world data. In our framework, the Barabasi-Albert model of network evolution is extended by assuming that link weights evolve according to a geometric Brownian motion. Our model is verified by means of simulations and real world trade data. We show that the model correctly predicts the intensity and growth distribution of links, the size-variance relationships of the growth of link weights, the relationship between the degree and strength of nodes, as well as the scale-free structure of the network.",Human
"We propose a scheme for efficient cavity-enhanced nonlinear THz generation via difference-frequency generation (DFG) processes using a triply resonant system based on photonic crystal cavities. We show that high nonlinear overlap can be achieved by coupling a THz cavity to a doubly-resonant, dual-polarization near-infrared (e.g. telecom band) photonic-crystal nanobeam cavity, allowing the mixing of three mutually orthogonal fundamental cavity modes through a chi(2) nonlinearity. We demonstrate through coupled-mode theory that complete depletion of the pump frequency - i.e., quantum-limited conversion - is possible in an experimentally feasible geometry, with the operating output power at the point of optimal total conversion efficiency adjustable by varying the mode quality (Q) factors.",Human
"We analyze deficiencies of commonly used Coulomb approximations in Generalized Born solvation energy calculation models and report a development of a new fast surface-based method (FSBE) for numerical calculations of the solvation energy of biomolecules with charged groups. The procedure is only a few percents wrong for molecular configurations of arbitrary sizes, provides explicit values for the reaction field potential at any point of the molecular interior, water polarization at the surface of the molecule, both the solvation energy value and its derivatives suitable for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The method works well both for large and small molecules and thus gives stable energy differences for quantities such as solvation energies contributions to a molecular complex formation.",Human
"The first numerical simulation of the process of ionization of an atom adsorbed on a metal surface by the subfemtosecond pulse is presented. The streaking scheme is considered, when a weak sub-femtosecond pulse comes together with a strong IR pulse with a variable delay between them. The problem is analyzed with numerical solving the non-stationary Schroedinger equation in the cylindrical coordinate. The results obtained are compared with ones in the gas phase. We show that the surface influences the DDCS, but the observation of this influence, beside the trivial polarization shift of the energy of the initial state, requires a quite high experimental resolution.",Human
"The design, implementation and analysis of a free library for boundary element calculations is presented. The library is free in the sense of the GNU General Public Licence and is intended to allow users to solve a wide range of problems using the boundary element method. The library incorporates a fast multipole method which is tailored to boundary elements of order higher than zero, taking account of the finite extent of the elements in the generation of the domain tree. The method is tested on a sphere and on a cube, to test its ability to handle sharp edges, and is found to be accurate, efficient and convergent.",Human
The quantum normal form approach to quantum transition state theory is used to compute the cumulative reaction probability for collinear exchange reactions. It is shown that for heavy atom systems like the nitrogen exchange reaction the quantum normal form approach gives excellent results and has major computational benefits over full reactive scattering approaches. For light atom systems like the hydrogen exchange reaction however the quantum normal approach is shown to give only poor results. This failure is attributed to the importance of tunnelling trajectories in light atom reactions that are not captured by the quantum normal form as indicated by the only very slow convergence of the quantum normal form for such systems.,Human
"Magnetic-sensitive radical-ion-pair reactions are understood to underlie the biochemical magnetic compass used by avian species for navigation. Recent experiments have provided growing evidence for the radical-ion-pair magnetoreception mechanism, while recent theoretical advances have unravelled the quantum nature of radical-ion-pair reactions, which were shown to manifest a host of quantum-information-science concepts and effects, like quantum measurement, quantum jumps and the quantum Zeno effect. We here show that the quantum Zeno effect provides for the robustness of the avian compass mechanism, and immunizes it's magnetic and angular sensitivity against the deleterious and molecule-specific exchange and dipolar interactions.",Human
"The density functional theory (DFT) interaction energy of a dimer is rigorously derived from the monomer densities. To this end, the supermolecular energy bifunctional is formulated in terms of mutually orthogonal sets of orbitals of the constituent monomers. The orthogonality condition is preserved in the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations through the Pauli blockade method. Numerical implementation of the method provides interaction energies which agree with those obtained from standard supermolecular calculations within less than 0.1% error for three example functionals: Slater-Dirac, PBE0 and B3LYP, and for two model van der Waals dimers: Ne2 and (C2H4)2, and two model H-bond complexes: (HF)2 and (NH3)2.",Human
"Kramers-Moyal coefficients provide a simple and easily visualized method with which to analyze stochastic time series, particularly nonlinear ones. One mechanism that can affect the estimation of the coefficients is geometric projection effects. For some biologically-inspired examples, these effects are predicted and explored with a non-stochastic projection operator method, and compared with direct numerical simulation of the systems' Langevin equations. General features and characteristics are identified, and the utility of the Kramers-Moyal method discussed. Projections of a system are in general non-Markovian, but here the Kramers-Moyal method remains useful, and in any case the primary examples considered are found to be close to Markovian.",Human
"The study of nonlinear dynamics or chaos theory has emerged in the last three decades or so as an important interdisciplinary area of research encompassing a wide range of fields like: fluids, plasmas, biomedical sciences, finance, turbulence, astronomy, material sciences, etc. In plasma chaos was first experimentally observed by Boswell. Different other nonlinear dynamics related phenomena like, the intermittency route to a chaos, Homoclinic chaos, Period adding route to chaos and period subtracting, mode locking, period pulling, etc., had been observed by several researchers.   In this thesis, we have presented (a) anode glow related observation of chaos to order transition and homoclinic bifurcation; (b) coherence resonance and stochastic resonance; and self organized criticality behavior in glow discharge plasma.",Human
"Network motifs are small building blocks of complex networks. Statistically significant motifs often perform network-specific functions. However, the precise nature of the connection between motifs and the global structure and function of networks remains elusive. Here we show that the global structure of some real networks is statistically determined by the probability of connections within motifs of size at most 3, once this probability accounts for node degrees. The connectivity profiles of node triples in these networks capture all their local and global properties. This finding impacts methods relying on motif statistical significance, and enriches our understanding of the elementary forces that shape the structure of complex networks.",Human
"Uncovering the mechanism leading to the scaling law in human trajectories is of fundamental importance in understanding many spatiotemporal phenomena. We propose a hierarchical geographical model to mimic the real traffic system, upon which a random walker will generate a power-law travel displacement distribution with exponent -2. When considering the inhomogeneities of cities' locations and attractions, this model reproduces a power-law displacement distribution with an exponential cutoff, as well as a scaling behavior in the probability density of having traveled a certain distance at a certain time. Our results agree very well with the empirical observations reported in [D. Brockmann et al., Nature 439, 462 (2006)].",Human
We discuss the properties of the transmission function in the k-space for a generic multi-layered structure. In particular we analytically demonstrate that a transmission greater than one in the evanescent spectrum (amplification of the evanescent modes) can be directly linked to the guided modes supported by the structure. Moreover we show that the slope of the phase of the transmission function in the propagating spectrum is inversely proportional to the ability of the structure to compensate the diffraction of the propagating modes. We apply these findings to discuss several examples where super-resolution is achieved thanks to the simultaneous availability of the amplification of the evanescent modes and the diffraction compensation of the propagating modes.,Human
"We report techniques for the fabrication of multi-zone linear RF Paul traps that exploit the machinability and electrical conductivity of degenerate silicon. The approach was tested by trapping and laser cooling 24Mg+ ions in two trap geometries: a single-zone two-layer trap and a multi-zone surface-electrode trap. From the measured ion motional heating rate we determine an electric field spectral density at the ion's position of approximately 1E-10 (V/m)^2/Hz at a frequency of 1.125 MHz when the ion lies 40 micron above the trap surface. One application of these devices is controlled manipulation of atomic ion qubits, the basis of one form of quantum information processing.",Human
"The interaction between the field emission resonance states and the photodetached electron in an electric field is studied by semiclassical theory. An analytical expression of the photodetachment cross section is derived in the framework. It is found that the Stark shifted image state modulates the photodetachment cross section by adding irregular staircase or smooth oscillation in the spectrum. When the photodetached electron is trapped in Stark shifted image potential well, the detachment spectrum displays an irregular staircase structure which corresponds to the modified Rydberg series. While the photodetached electron is not bound by the surface potential well, the cross secton contains only a smooth oscillation due to the reflection of electronic wave by the field or the surface.",Human
"We discuss heat conductivity from the point of view of a variational multi-fluid model, treating entropy as a dynamical entity. We demonstrate that a two-fluid model with a massive fluid component and a massless entropy can reproduce a number of key results from extended irreversible thermodynamics. In particular, we show that the entropy entrainment is intimately linked to the thermal relaxation time that is required to make heat propagation in solids causal. We also discuss non-local terms that arise naturally in a dissipative multi-fluid model, and relate these terms to those of phonon hydrodynamics. Finally, we formulate a complete heat conducting two-component model and discuss briefly the new dissipative terms that arise.",Human
"We report a development of a new fast surface-based method for numerical calculations of solvation energy of biomolecules with a large number of charged groups. The procedure scales linearly with the system size both in time and memory requirements, is only a few percent wrong for any molecular configurations of arbitrary sizes, gives explicit value for the reaction field potential at any point, provides both the solvation energy and its derivatives suitable for Molecular Dynamics simulations. The method works well both for large and small molecules and thus gives stable energy differences for quantities such as solvation energies of molecular complex formation.",Human
"A peculiar property of complex scattering potentials is the appearance of spectral singularities. These are energy eigenvalues for certain scattering states that similarly to resonance states have infinite reflection and transmission coefficients. This property reveals an interesting resonance effect with possible applications in waveguide physics. We study the spectral singularities of a complex barrier potential and explore their application in designing a waveguide that functions as a resonator. We show that for the easily accessible sizes of the waveguide and its gain region, we can realize the spectral singularity-related resonance phenomenon at almost every wavelength within the visible spectrum or outside it.",Human
"This is a written version of the opening talk at the 6th International Workshop on Chiral Dynamics, at the University of Bern, Switzerland, July 6, 2009, to be published in the proceedings of the Workshop. In it, I reminisce about the early development of effective field theories of the strong interactions, comment briefly on some other applications of effective field theories, and then take up the idea that the Standard Model and General Relativity are the leading terms in an effective field theory. Finally, I cite recent calculations that suggest that the effective field theory of gravitation and matter is asymptotically safe.",Human
"According to GSI experiment Phys.Lett.B 664, 162 (2008), the rate of the daughter ion production by the K-shell electron capture (with neutrino emission) in H-like ions 142Pm, 140Pr and 152I is modulated with a period of 6 to 7 seconds. In PRL 103, 062502, 2009 by Ivanov and Kienle (also by Lipkin}) there is a claim that neutrino oscillations may explain this result. In arXiv:0811.2302 by Lambiase et al a different explanation is suggested which is based on the rotation of electron and nuclear spins. The aim of this Comment is to show why these explanations are not satisfactory and to discuss other possibilities.",Human
"We study the efficiency, precision and accuracy of all-electron variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations using Slater basis sets. Starting from wave functions generated by Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, we describe an algorithm to enforce the electron-nucleus cusp condition by linear projection. For the 55 molecules in the G2 set, the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations recovers an average of 95% of the correlation energy and reproduces bond energies to a mean absolute deviation of 3.2 kcal/mol. Comparing the individual total energies with essentially exact values, we investigate the error cancellation in atomization and chemical reaction path energies, giving additional insight into the sizes of nodal surface errors.",Human
"The generation of highly charged Xe$^{q+}$ ions up to {$q=24$} is observed in Xe clusters embedded in helium nanodroplets and exposed to intense femtosecond laser pulses ($\lambda$=800 nm). Laser intensity resolved measurements show that the high-$q$ ion generation starts at an unexpectedly low threshold intensity of about {10$^{14}$ W/cm$^{2}$}. Above threshold, the Xe ion charge spectrum saturates quickly and changes only weakly for higher laser intensities. Good agreement between these observations and a molecular dynamics analysis allows us to identify the mechanisms responsible for the highly charged ion production and the surprising intensity threshold behavior of the ionization process.",Human
"Structures, physical and chemical properties of V doped Co$_{13}$ clusters have been studied in detail using density functional theory based first-principles method. We have found anomalous variation in stability of the doped clusters with increasing V concentration, which has been nicely demonstrated in terms of energetics and electronic properties of the clusters. Our study explains the nonmonotonic variation in reactivity of Co$_{13-m}$V$_m$ clusters towards H$_2$ molecules as reported experimentally [J. Phys. Chem. {\bf 94}, 2744 (1990)]. Moreover, it provides useful insight into the cluster geometry and chemically active sites on the cluster surface, which can help to design better catalytic processes.",Human
"We analytically find an approximate Bloch-Messiah reduction of a noncollinear parametric amplifier pumped with a focused monochromatic beam. We consider type I phase matching. The results are obtained using a perturbative expansion and scaled to a high gain regime. They allow a straightforward maximization of the signal gain and minimization of the parametric fluorescence noise. We find the fundamental mode of the amplifier, which is an elliptic Gaussian defining the optimal seed beam shape. We conclude that the output of the amplifier should be stripped of higher order modes, which are approximately Hermite-Gaussian beams. Alternatively, the pump waist can be adjusted such that the amount of noise produced in the higher order modes is minimized.",Human
"The surface current method known in the theory of electromagnetic waves diffraction is generalized to be applied for the problems of diffraction radiation generated by a charged particle moving nearby an ideally-conducting screen in vacuum. An expression for induced surface current density leading to the exact results in the theory of transition radiation is derived, and by using this expression several exact solutions of diffraction radiation problems are found. Limits of applicability for the earlier known models based on the surface current conception are indicated. Properties of radiation from a semi-plane and from a slit in cylinder are investigated at the various distances to observer.",Human
"Optics of metamaterials is shown to provide interesting table top models of many non-trivial space-time metrics. The range of possibilities is broader than the one allowed in classical general relativity. For example, extraordinary waves in indefinite metamaterials experience an effective metric, which is formally equivalent to the ""two times physics"" model in 2+2 dimensions. An optical analogue of a ""big bang"" event is presented during which a (2+1) Minkowski space-time is created together with large number of particles populating this space-time. Such metamaterial models enable experimental exploration of the metric phase transitions to and from the Minkowski space-time as a function of temperature and/or light frequency.",Human
"An approach to correlated dynamics of quantum nuclei and electrons both in dynamical interaction with external environments is presented. This stochastic quantum molecular dynamics rests on a theorem that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the total ensemble-averaged current density of interacting nuclei and electrons and a given external vector potential. The theory allows for a first-principles description of phenomena previously inaccessible via standard quantum molecular dynamics such as electronic and nuclear relaxation in photochemistry, dissipative correlated electron-ion dynamics in intense laser fields, nuclear dephasing, etc. As a demonstration of the approach, we discuss the rotational relaxation of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzonitrile in a uniform bath in the limit of classical nuclei.",Human
"Time projection chambers drifting negative ions (NITPC) instead of electrons have several advantages. A NITPC can operate at very high reduced drift fields without diffusion runaway, and the readout digitization sampling rate requirement is considerably relaxed due to the low drift speed of negative ions. The initiation of Townsend avalanches to allow gas gain in these devices has not been understood until now. It is shown here that the avalanche in low pressure CS$_2$ vapor is most likely initiated by collisional detachment of the electron from the negative molecular ion. In mixtures of Nitromethane vapor with CO$_2$ the mechanism appears to be more complex.",Human
"Non-extensive statistical physics has allowed to generalize mathematical functions such as exponential and logarithms. The same framework is used to generalize sum and product so that the operations allow a more fluid way to work with mathematical expressions emerging from non-additive formulation of statistical physics. In this work we employ the generalization of the exponential, logarithm and product to obtain a formula for the survival fraction corresponding to the application of several radiation doses on a living tissue. Also we provide experimental recommendations to determine the universal characteristics of living tissues in interaction with radiation. These results have a potential application in radiobiology and radiation oncology.",Human
"A detailed study of the angular, energy and polarization dependences of the electric dipolar (E1: 2p->5d) and quadrupolar (E2: 2p->4f) contributions to the x-ray scattering cross-section is presented for holmium in its basal plane spiral antiferromagnetic phase at the L3 edge. The corresponding E1 and E2 scattering factors have been extracted from fits to the experimental energy line shapes taking into account for the first time a split dipole resonance. Using the imaginary part of the resonant scattering factors to retrieve the XMCD spectrum, we find qualitative agreement with the dichroic spectrum measured in transmission through a holmium foil.",Human
"Photoassociation (PA) spectrum in the presence of a magnetic Feshbach resonance is analyzed. Nonperturbative solution of the problem yields analytical expressions for PA linewidth and shift which are applicable for arbitrary PA laser intensity and magnetic field tuning of Feshbach Resonance. We show that by tuning magnetic field close to Fano minimum, it is possible to suppress power broadening at increased laser intensities. This occurs due to quantum interference of PA transitions from unperturbed and perturbed continuum. Line narrowing at high laser intensities is accompanied by large spectral shifts. We briefly discuss important consequences of line narrowing in cold collisions.",Human
"We apply tomography, a general method for reconstructing 3-D distributions from multiple projections, to reconstruct the momentum distribution of electrons produced via strong field photoionization. The projections are obtained by rotating the electron distribution via the polarization of the ionizing laser beam and recording a momentum spectrum at each angle with a 2-D velocity map imaging spectrometer. For linearly polarized light the tomographic reconstruction agrees with the distribution obtained using an Abel inversion. Electron tomography, which can be applied to any polarization, will simplify the technology of electron imaging. The method can be directly generalized to other charged particles.",Human
"We report our recent simulations on the social processes which -- in our opinion -- lie at the bottom of hate. First simulation deals with the so-called Heider balance where initial purely random preferences split the community into two mutually hostile groups. Second simulation shows that once these groups are formed, the cooperation between them is going to fail. Third simulation provides a numerical illustration of the process of biased learning; the model indicates that lack of objective information is a barrier to new information. Fourth simulation shows that in the presence of a strong conflict between communities hate is unavoidable.",Human
"We study spectroscopy of artificial solid-state four-level quantum system. This system is formed by two coupled superconducting flux qubits. When multiple driving frequency of the applied microwaves matches the energy difference between any two levels, the transition to the upper level is induced. We demonstrate two types of the multi-photon transitions: direct transitions between two levels and ladder-type transitions via an intermediate level. For the latter transitions, in particular, the inverse population of the excited state with respect to the ground one is realized. These processes can be useful for the control of the level population for the multilevel scalable quantum systems.",Human
"In this paper B-Rank, an efficient ranking algorithm for recommender systems, is proposed. B-Rank is based on a random walk model on hypergraphs. Depending on the setup, B-Rank outperforms other state of the art algorithms in terms of precision, recall (19% - 50%), and inter list diversity (20% - 60%). B-Rank captures well the difference between popular and niche objects. The proposed algorithm produces very promising results for sparse and dense voting matrices. Furthermore, a recommendation list update algorithm is introduced,to cope with new votes. This technique significantly reduces computational complexity. The implementation of the algorithm is simple, since B-Rank needs no parameter tuning.",Human
"Standard DNA melting curves record the separation of the two strands versus temperature, but they do not provide any information on the location of the opening. We introduce an experimental method which adds a new dimension to the melting curves of short DNA sequences by allowing us to record the degree of opening in several positions along the molecule all at once. This adds the spatial dimension to the melting curves and allows a precise investigation of the role of the base-pair sequence on the fluctuations and denaturation of the DNA double helix. We illustrate the power of the method by investigating the influence of an AT rich region on the fluctuations of neighboring domains.",Human
"The precision measurements envisaged at the International Linear Collider (ILC) depend on excellent instrumentation and reconstruction software. The correct identification of heavy flavour jets, placing unprecedented requirements on the quality of the vertex detector, will be central for the ILC programme. This paper describes the LCFIVertex software, which provides tools for vertex finding and for identification of the flavour and charge of the leading hadron in heavy flavour jets. These tools are essential for the ongoing optimisation of the vertex detector design for linear colliders such as the ILC. The paper describes the algorithms implemented in the LCFIVertex package, as well as the scope of the code and its performance for a typical vertex detector design.",Human
"We show that a combination of linear absorption spectroscopy, hyper-Rayleigh scattering, and a theoretical analysis using sum rules to reduce the size of the parameter space leads to a prediction of the two-photon absorption cross-section of the dye AF455 that agrees with two-photon absorption spectroscopy. Our procedure, which demands self-consistency between several measurement techniques and does not use adjustable parameters, provides a means for determining transition moments between the dominant excited states based strictly on experimental characterization. This is made possible by our new approach that uses sum rules and molecular symmetry to rigorously reduce the number of required physical quantities.",Human
"Conventional descriptions of transverse waves in an elastic solid are limited by an assumption of infinitesimally small gradients of rotation. By assuming a linear response to variations in orientation, we derive an exact description of a restricted class of rotational waves in an ideal isotropic elastic solid. The result is a nonlinear equation expressed in terms of Dirac bispinors. This result provides a simple classical interpretation of relativistic quantum mechanical dynamics. We construct a Lagrangian of the form L=-E+U+K=0, where E is the total energy, U is the potential energy, and K is the kinetic energy.",Human
"In most sociophysical simulations on public opinion, only two opinions are allowed: Pro and Contra. However, in all political elections many people do not vote. Here we analyse two models of dynamics of public opinion, taking into account Indifferent voters: {\it i)} the Sznajd model with symmetry Pro-Contra, {\it ii)} the outflow one move voter model, where Contra's are converted to Indifferent by their Pro neighbours. Our results on the Sznajd model are in an overall agreement with the results of the mean field approach and with those known from the initial model formulation. The simulation on the voter model shows that an amount of Contra's who remain after convertion depends on the network topology.",Human
"We derive the nonlinear equations satisfied by the coefficients of linear combinations that maximize their skewness when their variance is constrained to take a specific value. In order to numerically solve these nonlinear equations we develop a gradient-type flow that preserves the constraint. In combination with the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition this leads to a set of orthogonal modes with maximal skewness. For illustration purposes we apply these techniques to atmospheric data; in this case the maximal-skewness modes correspond to strongly localized atmospheric flows. We show how these ideas can be extended, for example to maximal-flatness modes.",Human
"The mechanism of unidirectional emission of high Q Whispering Gallery mode in deformed circular micro- cavities is studied and firstly presented in this paper. In phase space, light in the chaotic sea leaks out the cavity through the refraction regions, whose positions are controlled by stable islands. Moreover, the positions of fixed points according to the critical line in unstable manifolds mainly determines the light leak out from which refraction region and the direction of the emission. By controlling the cavity shape, we can tune the leaky regions, as well as the positions of fixed points, to achieve unidirectional emission high Q cavities with narrow angular divergence both in high and low refractive index mater",Human
"The two-loop self-energy correction to the ground state Lamb shift is calculated for hydrogen-like ions with the nuclear charge Z=10-30 without any expansion in the binding field of the nucleus. A calculational technique is reported for treatment of Feynman diagrams in the mixed coordinate-momentum representation, which yields significant improvement in numerical accuracy as compared to previous results. An extrapolation of the all-order numerical data towards Z=1 yields a result for the higher-order remainder function for hydrogen. The previously reported disagreement between the all-order and the perturbative approaches is reduced to the marginal agreement.",Human
"We show that the success of cooperation in an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma on a complex network can be predicted by a simple, quantitative network analysis using mean field parameters. The criterion is shown to be accurate on a wide variety of networks with degree distributions ranging from regular to Poisson to scale-free. The network analysis uses a parameter that allows for comparisons of networks with both similar, and distinct, topologies. Furthermore, we establish the criterion here as a natural network analogue of Hamilton's classical rule for kin selection, despite arising in an entirely different context. The result is a network-based evolutionary rule for altruism that parallels Hamilton's genetic rule.",Human
"In January 2001, air samples were collected from Earth's stratosphere. From these air samples, cultures of three microorganisms were obtained. It was reasoned that these microorganisms are of cometary origin and thereby cometary panspermia stood vindicated. The fact that these microorganisms had essentially the same characteristics as terrestrial microorganisms was explained using cometary panspermia. Here, the findings are reinterpreted in the light of niche ecology and adaptations. It is asserted that the microorganisms captured from the stratosphere cannot be of cometary origin as they are contrary to the kind of microorganisms one would expect to find in a cometary niche.",Human
"We report on the linear and nonlinear optical response of metamaterials evoked by first and second order multipoles. The analytical ground on which our approach bases permits for new insights into the functionality of metamaterials. For the sake of clarity we focus here on a key geometry, namely the split-ring resonator, although the introduced formalism can be applied to arbitrary structures. We derive the equations that describe linear and nonlinear light propagation where special emphasis is put on second harmonic generation. This contribution basically aims at stretching versatile and existing concepts to describe light propagation in nonlinear media towards the realm of metamaterials.",Human
"We theoretically investigate into the effects of the incidence angles in light transmission of cholesteric liquid crystal two-layer sandwich structures with twist defects created by rotation of the one layer about the helical axis.The conoscopic images and polarization resolved patterns are obtained for thick layers by computing the intensity and the polarization parameters as a function of the incidence angles.In addition to the defect angle induced rotation of the pictures as a whole, the rings of defect mode resonances are found to shrink to the origin and disappear as the defect twist angle varies from zero to its limiting value and beyond.",Human
"We present experimental studies on ion acceleration from ultra-thin diamond-like carbon (DLC) foils irradiated by ultra-high contrast laser pulses of energy 0.7 J focussed to peak intensities of 5*10^{19} W/cm^2. A reduction in electron heating is observed when the laser polarization is changed from linear to circular, leading to a pronounced peak in the fully ionized carbon spectrum at the optimum foil thickness of 5.3 nm. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations reveal, that those C^{6+} ions are for the first time dominantly accelerated in a phase-stable way by the laser radiation pressure.",Human
"The polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities of the Be$^+$ ion in the $2^2S$ state and the $2^2P$ state are determined. Calculations are performed using two independent methods: i) variationally determined wave functions using Hylleraas basis set expansions and ii) single electron calculations utilizing a frozen-core Hamiltonian. The first few parameters in the long-range interaction potential between a Be$^+$ ion and a H, He, or Li atom, and the leading parameters of the effective potential for the high-$L$ Rydberg states of beryllium were also computed. All the values reported are the results of calculations close to convergence. Comparisons are made with published results where available.",Human
"Preons are hypothetic constituents of the standard particles. They were initially assumed to have basically similar properties to those of conventional matter. But this is not necessarily the case: the ultimate constituents of matter may feel a different space-time from that of special relativity and exhibit mechanical properties different from those predicted by standard quantum mechanics. They can also play an important cosmological role (inflation, dark matter, dark energy...). It is even not obvious that energy and momentum would have to be conserved in such a scenario. In this series of papers, we review the subject using the superbradyon model as an example, and suggest new ways to explore possible tests of the preon hypothesis.",Human
"The dependence of DNA assemblies conductance on relative humidity is investigated theoretically. Following earlier suggestions, we consider the ionic conductivity through the layers of water adsorbed by DNA molecules. The increase in humidity results in a growing water layer. The binding energy of ions depends on the thickness of the water layer due to change in water polarization. This dependence is very strong at smaller thicknesses of water layers due to the low-dimensional confinement of an electric field in water. We show that the associated change in ion concentration can explain the six orders of magnitude increase in conductivity, with relative humidity growing from 0.05 to 0.95",Human
"We study the properties of an atom laser beam derived from a Bose-Einstein condensate using three different outcouplers, one based on multi-state radio frequency transitions and two others based on Raman transitions capable of imparting momentum to the beam. We first summarize the differences that arise in such systems, and how they may impact on the use of an atom laser in interferometry. Experimentally, we examine the formation of a bound state in all three outcouplers, a phenomenon which limits the atom laser flux, and find that a two-state Raman outcoupler is the preferred option for high flux, low divergence atom laser beams.",Human
"We use agent-based modeling to investigate the effect of conservatism and partisanship on the efficiency with which large populations solve the density classification task--a paradigmatic problem for information aggregation and consensus building. We find that conservative agents enhance the populations' ability to efficiently solve the density classification task despite large levels of noise in the system. In contrast, we find that the presence of even a small fraction of partisans holding the minority position will result in deadlock or a consensus on an incorrect answer. Our results provide a possible explanation for the emergence of conservatism and suggest that even low levels of partisanship can lead to significant social costs.",Human
"Because the interaction is well-known, Coulomb excitation is one of the best tools for the investigation of nuclear properties. In the last 3 decades new reaction theories for Coulomb excitation have been developed such as: (a) relativistic Coulomb excitation, (b) Coulomb excitation at intermediate energies, and (c) multistep coupling in the continuum. These developments are timely with the advent of rare isotope facilities. Of special interest is the Coulomb excitation and dissociation of weakly-bound systems. I review the Coulomb excitation theory, from low to relativistic collision energies. Several applications of the theory to situations of interest in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics are discussed.",Human
"In this manuscript we introduce a generalisation of the log-Normal distribution that is inspired by a modification of the Kaypten multiplicative process using the $q$-product of Borges [Physica A \textbf{340}, 95 (2004)]. Depending on the value of q the distribution increases the tail for small (when $q<1$) or large (when $q>1$) values of the variable upon analysis. The usual log-Normal distribution is retrieved when $q=1$. The main statistical features of this distribution are presented as well as a related random number generators and tables of quantiles of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Lastly, we illustrate the application of this distribution studying the adjustment of a set of variables of biological and financial origin.",Human
"We use the graphics processing unit (GPU) for fast calculations of helicity amplitudes of physics processes. As our first attempt, we compute $u\bar{u}\to n\gamma$ ($n=2$ to 8) processes in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 14$TeV by transferring the MadGraph generated HELAS amplitudes (FORTRAN) into newly developed HEGET ({\bf H}ELAS {\bf E}valuation with {\bf G}PU {\bf E}nhanced {\bf T}echnology) codes written in CUDA, a C-platform developed by NVIDIA for general purpose computing on the GPU. Compared with the usual CPU programs, we obtain 40-150 times better performance on the GPU.",Human
We report on hyperfine-resolved spectroscopic measurements of the electric-dipole forbidden 5$p_{3/2} \to 8p_{1/2}$ transition in a sample of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms. The hyperfine selection rules enable the weak magnetic-dipole (M1) contribution to the transition strength to be distinguished from the much stronger electric-quadrupole (E2) contribution. An upper limit on the M1 transition strength is determined that is about 50 times smaller than an earlier experimental determination. We also calculate the expected value of the M1 matrix element and find that it is less than the upper limit extracted from the experiment.,Human
"We analyze the relationship between the bound and the free waves in the noncollinear SHG scheme, along with the vectorial conservation law for the different components arising when there are two pump beams impinging on the sample with two different incidence angles. The generated power is systematically investigated, by varying the polarization state of both fundamental beams, while absorption is included via the Herman and Hayden correction terms. The theoretical simulations, obtained for samples which are some coherence length thick show that the resulting polarization mapping is an useful tool to put in evidence the interference between bound and free waves, as well as the effect of absorption on the interference pattern",Human
"Based on the transformation optics, a novel transmission-line (TL) approach to realize invisibility cloaking using planar anisotropic metamaterials (MTMs) is proposed. The two-dimensional cylindrical cloaks are modeled based on inductor-capacitor (L-C) MTMs networks. The three elements of the constitutive parameters are all allowed to be spatially inhomogeneous which lead to the full parameter realization of a cylindrical cloak. As an example, a cloak working at VHF band is modeled and its invisibility behavior is demonstrated based on the solution of the node voltage distribution. Due to the non-resonant properties of the L-C elements, the broadband characteristic of the proposed cloaks is also evident.",Human
"A non-uniqueness result for the canonical structure in quantum theory shows that the classical part of the Copenhagen interpretation contains physically important information not contained in its quantum part. As a consequence, we cannot compute the symmetry group of a quantum theory considering only the quantum part. The unavoidable vagueness of the classical part therefore leads to a similar vagueness in the definition of the symmetry group. This makes it at least problematic, if not impossible, to establish the true symmetry group of a quantum theory in the Copenhagen interpretation. Different from the old measurement problem, the symmetry group is to important physically to be rejected as a metaphysical pseudoproblem.",Human
"We present a novel approach to reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling, SpecSwap-RMC, which makes use of pre-computed property data from a discrete configuration space replacing atomistic moves with swap moves of contributions to a sample-set representing the average, or summed property. The approach is particularly suitable for disordered systems and properties which require significant computer time to compute. We demonstrate the approach by fitting jointly and separately the EXAFS signal and x-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) of ice Ih using as SpecSwap sample-set 80 configurations from a space of 1382 local structures with associated pre-computed spectra. As an additional demonstration we compare SpecSwap and FEFFIT fits of EXAFS data on crystalline copper finding excellent agreement.",Human
"The MEG experiment is designed to search the Lepton Flavor Violating process $\mu \to e^+\gamma$ \cite{mori-1999,meg2007-baldini}. This search requires a high intensity muon beam stopping in a thin target with the maximum rate compatible with the background from combinatorial events.   The events are analyzed by a high resolution and fast liquid xenon calorimeter and by a spectrometer composed by an array of ultra-light drift chambers (DCH) for momentum measurement and a double layered timing counter (TC) for measuring the $e^+$ time.   The design parameters and performance of the spectrometer during the 2008 physics run are described.",Human
"Spin relaxation due to atom-atom collisions is measured for magnetically trapped erbium and thulium atoms at a temperature near 500 mK. The rate constants for Er-Er and Tm-Tm collisions are 3.0 times 10^-10 cm^3 s^-1 and 1.1 times 10^-10 cm^3 s^-1, respectively, 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than those observed for highly magnetic S-state atoms. This is strong evidence for an additional, dominant, spin relaxation mechanism, electrostatic anisotropy, in collisions between these ""submerged-shell"" L > 0 atoms. These large spin relaxation rates imply that evaporative cooling of these atoms in a magnetic trap will be highly inefficient.",Human
"Parity and time invariance violating electric dipole moment of $^{205}$Tl is calculated using the relativistic Hartree-Fock and configuration interaction methods and the many-body perturbation theory. Contributions from the interaction of the electron electric dipole moments with internal electric field and scalar-pseudoscalar electron-nucleon (T,P)-odd interaction are considered. The results are $d(^{205}{\rm Tl})=-582(20) d_e$ or $d(^{205}{\rm Tl})=-7.0(2)\times 10^{-18}C^{SP} e {\rm cm}$. Interpretation of the measurements are discussed. The results of similar calculations for $^{133}$Cs are $d(^{133}{\rm Cs})=124(4) d_e$ or $d(^{133}{\rm Cs})=0.76(2)\times 10^{-18}C^{SP} e {\rm cm}$.",Human
"Shear-induced cross-correlations of particle fluctuations perpendicular and along stream-lines are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Direct measurements of the Brownian motion of micron-sized beads, held by optical tweezers in a shear-flow cell, show a strong time-asymmetry in the cross-correlation, which is caused by the non-normal amplification of fluctuations. Complementary measurements on the single particle probability distribution substantiate this behavior and both results are consistent with a Langevin model. In addition, a shear-induced anti-correlation between orthogonal random-displacements of two trapped and hydrodynamically interacting particles is detected, having one or two extrema in time, depending on the positions of the particles.",Human
"The conventional wisdom is that social networks exhibit an assortative mixing pattern, whereas biological and technological networks show a disassortative mixing pattern. However, the recent research on the online social networks modifies the widespread belief, and many online social networks show a disassortative or neutral mixing feature. Especially, we found that an online social network, Wealink, underwent a transition from degree assortativity characteristic of real social networks to degree disassortativity characteristic of many online social networks, and the transition can be reasonably elucidated by a simple network model that we propose. The relations among network assortativity, clustering, and modularity are also discussed in the paper.",Human
"In this work some possible applications of negative permeability magnetic metamaterial lenses for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are analyzed. Metamaterials are artificial composites designed to have a given permittivity and/or permeability, including negative values for these constants. It is shown that using magnetic metamaterials lenses it is possible to manipulate the spatial distribution of the radio-frequency (RF) field used in MR systems and, under some circumstances, improve the sensitivity of surface coils. Furthermore a collimation of the RF field, phenomenon that may find application in parallel imaging, is presented. MR images of real tissues are shown in order to prove the suitability of the theoretical analysis for practical applications.",Human
"We control the quantum mechanical motion of neutral atoms in an optical lattice by driving microwave transitions between spin states whose trapping potentials are spatially offset. Control of this offset with nanometer precision allows for adjustment of the coupling strength between different motional states, analogous to an adjustable effective Lamb-Dicke factor. This is used both for efficient one-dimensional sideband cooling of individual atoms to a vibrational ground state population of 97%, and to drive coherent Rabi oscillation between arbitrary pairs of vibrational states. We further show that microwaves can drive well resolved transitions between motional states in maximally offset, shallow lattices, and thus in principle allow for coherent control of long range quantum transport.",Human
"It is pointed out that relativistic classical electron theory with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation has a scaling symmetry which is suitable for understanding the equilibrium behavior of classical thermal radiation at a spectrum other than the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. In relativistic classical electron theory, the masses of the particles are the only scale-giving parameters associated with mechanics while the action-angle variables are scale invariant. The theory thus separates the interaction of the action variables of matter and radiation from the scale-giving parameters. Classical zero-point radiation is invariant under scattering by the charged particles of relativistic classical electron theory. The basic ideas of the matter -radiation interaction are illustrated in a simple relativistic classical electromagnetic example.",Human
"Biological units such as macromolecules, organelles, and cells are directed to a proper location under gradients of relevant chemicals. By considering a macroscopic element that has binding sites for a chemical adsorption reaction to occur on its surface, we show the existence of a thermodynamic force that is generated by the gradient and exerted on the element. By assuming local equilibrium and adopting the grand potential from thermodynamics, we derive a formula for such a thermodynamic force, which depends on the chemical potential gradient and Langmuir isotherm. The conditions under which the formula can be applied are demonstrated to hold in intracellular reactions. The role of the force in the partitioning of bacterial chromosome/plasmid during cell division is discussed.",Human
"Liquid Xenon (LXe) is an excellent material for experiments designed to detect dark matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). A low energy detection threshold is essential for a sensitive WIMP search. The understanding of the relative scintillation efficiency (Leff) and ionization yield of low energy nuclear recoils in LXe is limited for energies below 10 keV. In this paper, we present new measurements that extend the energy down to 4 keV, finding that Leff decreases with decreasing energy. We also measure the quenching of scintillation efficiency due to the electric field in LXe, finding no significant field dependence.",Human
"Kadath is a library that implements spectral methods in a very modular manner. It is designed to solve a wide class of problems that arise in the context of theoretical physics. Several types of coordinates are implemented and additional geometries can be easily encoded. Partial differential equations of various types are discretized by means of spectral methods. The resulting system is solved using a Newton-Raphson iteration. Doing so, Kadath is able to deal with strongly non-linear situations. The algorithms are validated by applying the library to four different problems of contemporary physics, in the fields of gauge field theory and general relativity",Human
"The study is motivated by recent findings of the decrease in the momentum transfer from strong winds to sea. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of a three-fluid system of air, foam and water is examined within the range of intermediately short surface waves. The foam layer thickness necessary for effective separation of the atmosphere and the ocean is estimated. Due to high density contrasts in the three-fluid system, even a relatively thin foam layer between the atmosphere and the ocean can provide a significant stabilization of the water surface by the wavelength shift of the instability towards smaller scales. It is conjectured that such stabilization qualitatively explains the observed reduction of roughness and drag.",Human
"We suggest some possible approaches of the unified equations of boson and fermion, which correspond to the unified statistics at high energy. A. The spin terms of equations can be neglected. B. The mass terms of equations can be neglected. C. The known equations of formal unification change to the same. They can be combined each other. We derive the chaos solution of the nonlinear equation, in which the chaos point should be a unified scale. Moreover, various unifications in particle physics are discussed. It includes the unifications of interactions and the unified collision cross sections, which at high energy trend toward constant and rise as energy increases.",Human
"We introduce a point-like scanning single-photon source that operates at room temperature and offers an exceptional photostability (no blinking, no bleaching). This is obtained by grafting in a controlled way a diamond nanocrystal (size around 20 nm) with single nitrogen-vacancy color-center occupancy at the apex of an optical probe. As an application, we image metallic nanostructures in the near-field, thereby achieving a near-field scanning single-photon microscopy working at room temperature on the long term. Our work may be of importance to various emerging fields of nanoscience where an accurate positioning of a quantum emitter is required such as for example quantum plasmonics.",Human
"The Exodus was causally connected to the eruption of Thera. The time of this geological event is determined by C14 dating as 1627-1600 BC. The chaos that followed this catastrophe led to upheavals which distorted the chronologies. Taking periods of foreign domination into account leads to an agreement between the chronologies of Egypt and Israel.   -----   Der Exodus wurde durch den Ausbruch von Thera ermoeglicht, welcher als geologisches Ereignis durch C14 Datierungen auf die Zeit 1627-1600 BC festgelegt ist.

"Recent advances in biochemical computing, i.e., information processing with cascades of primarily enzymatic reactions realizing computing gates, such as AND, OR, etc., as well as progress in networking these gates and coupling of the resulting systems to smart/responsive electrodes for output readout, have opened new biosensing opportunities. Here we survey existing enabling research results, as well as ideas and research avenues for future development of a new paradigm of digitally operating biosensors logically processing multiple biochemical signals through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular reactions, yielding the final output signals as YES/NO responses. Such systems can lead to high-fidelity biosensing compared to common single or parallel sensing devices.",Human
"The luminescence of 3 speleothem samples from the Acquafredda karst system and 1 from the Novella Cave (Gessi Bolognesi Natural Park, Italy) has been recorded using excitation by impulse Xe- lamp. All these carbonate speleothems are believed to be formed only from active CO2 from the air, because the bedrock of the cave consist of gypsum and does not contain carbonates. The obtained photos of luminescence record the climate changes during the speleothem growth. U/Th and 14C dating proved that studied speleothems started to grow since about 5,000 years ago. The detailed analyses of the luminescence records is still in progress.",Human
"This paper deals with the numerical reconstruction of the plasma current density in a Tokamak and of its equilibrium. The problem consists in the identification of a non-linear source in the 2D Grad-Shafranov equation, which governs the axisymmetric equilibrium of a plasma in a Tokamak. The experimental measurements that enable this identification are the magnetics on the vacuum vessel, but also polarimetric and interferometric measures on several chords, as well as motional Stark effect or pressure measurements. The reconstruction can be obtained in real-time using a finite element method, a non-linear fixed-point algorithm and a least-square optimization procedure.",Human
"We demonstrate serrodyne frequency shifting of light from 200 MHz to 1.2 GHz with an efficiency of better than 60 percent. The frequency shift is imparted by an electro-optic phase modulator driven by a high-frequency, high-fidelity sawtooth waveform that is passively generated by a commercially available Non-Linear Transmission Line (NLTL). We also implement a push-pull configuration using two serrodyne-driven phase modulators allowing for continuous tuning between -1.6 GHz and +1.6 GHz. Compared to competing technologies, this technique is simple and robust, and offers the largest available tuning range in this frequency band.",Human
"In this article, we study transportation network in Minnesota. We show that the system is characterized by Taylor's power law for fluctuation scaling with nontrivial values of the scaling exponent. We also show that the characteristic exponent does not unequivocally characterize a given road network, as it may differ within the same network if one takes into account location of observation points, season, period of day, or traffic intensity. The results are set against Taylor's fluctuation scaling in the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton model for traffic. It is shown that Taylor's law may serve, beside the fundamental diagram, as an indicator of different traffic phases (free flow, traffic jam etc.).",Human
"Using a new dynamical network model of society in which pairwise interactions are weighted according to mutual satisfaction, we show that cooperation is the norm in the Hawks-Doves game when individuals are allowed to break ties with undesirable neighbors and to make new acquaintances in their extended neighborhood. Moreover, cooperation is robust with respect to rather strong strategy perturbations. We also discuss the empirical structure of the emerging networks, and the reasons that allow cooperators to thrive in the population. Given the metaphorical importance of this game for social interaction, this is an encouraging positive result as standard theory for large mixing populations prescribes that a certain fraction of defectors must always exist at equilibrium.",Human
"In this work we suggest an original, realistic and simple, form of the experiment of interference of single photon at beam splitter. Here quantum entanglement (Schrodinger cat effect) between photon and photon trajectories detector (which includes two same simple two-level systems) is studied. It admits a consistent model of the detection or measurement procedure. Concretely here (self-)collapse at detector is consistently treated as the spontaneous (non-dynamical) breaking (effective hiding) of the unitary symmetry (superposition or entanglement) of quantum mechanical dynamics. It can be considered as an especial case of the general formalism of the spontaneous symmetry breaking.",Human
"The linear stability of thin Keplerian discs of weakly ionized polytropic plasma embedded in a mixed (toroidal-poloidal) axisymmetric magnetic field is studied. The effects of the central body on the equilibrium state of the discs are modeled by an axial total current and a dipole magnetic field. Studying the amplification of high-frequency waves shows that Keplerian discs can be destabilized due to combined effects of equilibrium density stratification and poloidal magnetic field. By considering a boundary value problem in the limit of strong Hall effect, it is shown that whistler waves which are free of direct influence of compressibility, rotation and gravity, are amplified along their trajectory while other modes of wave propagation do not change their amplitude.",Human
"An oscillating electric field at 1.356 GHz was used to promote the resonant energy transfer process: $43d_{5/2}+43d_{5/2} \to 45p_{3/2}+41f$ between translationally cold $^{85}$Rb Rydberg atoms. The ac Stark shifts due to this dressing field created degeneracies between the initial and final two-atom states of this process. The ac field strength was scanned to collect spectra which are analogous to dc electric-field-induced resonant energy transfer spectra. Different resonances were observed for different magnetic sublevels involved in the process. Compared to earlier work performed at higher frequencies, the choice of dressing frequency and structure of the spectra may be intuitively understood, by analogy with the dc field case.",Human
"In this work, it is pointed out that in the mean-field version of majority-rule opinion dynamics, the dependence of the consensus time on the population size exhibits two regimes. This is determined by the size distribution of the groups that, at each evolution step, gather to reach agreement. When the group size distribution has a finite mean value, the previously known logarithmic dependence on the population size holds. On the other hand, when the mean group size diverges, the consensus time and the population size are related through a power law. Numerical simulations validate this semi-quantitative analytical prediction.",Human
"A classical dusty plasma experiment was performed using two different dust grain sizes to form a strongly coupled asymmetric bilayer (two closely spaced interacting monolayers) of two species of charged dust particles. The observation and analysis of the thermally excited particle oscillations revealed the collective mode structure and wave dispersion in this system; in particular the existence of the theoretically predicted $k=0$ energy (frequency) gap was verified. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were performed to emulate the experiment, assuming Yukawa type inter-particle interaction. The simulations and analytic calculations based both on lattice summation and on the QLCA approach are in good agreement with the experimental findings and help identifying and characterizing the observed phenomena.",Human
"The most important processes for the creation of S12+ to S14+ ions excited states from the ground configurations of S9+ to S14+ ions in an electron cyclotron resonance ion source, leading to the emission of K X-ray lines, are studied. Theoretical values for inner-shell excitation and ionization cross sections, including double KL and triple KLL ionization, transition probabilities and energies for the deexcitation processes, are calculated in the framework of the multi-configuration Dirac-Fock method. With reasonable assumptions about the electron energy distribution, a theoretical K$\alpha$ X-ray spectrum is obtained, which is compared to recent experimental data.",Human
"We formulate the Born approximation for finding resonance poles in the complex plane for potential scattering problems. Using the method, we study the distribution of resonance poles for several scattering potentials. In particular, we find for an exponential potential with a cutoff that the cutoff generates an infinite series of extra resonance poles below and along the real axis, which would not exist without the cutoff. We also find for a Gaussian potential that the series of resonance poles approach the imaginary axis of the complex energy plane from left. In other words, the real parts of the resonant eigenenergis are all negative.",Human
"We study the dynamics of a pair of nonlinear split-ring resonators (a `metadimer') excited by an alternating magnetic field and coupled magnetically. Linear metadimers of this kind have been recently used as the elementary components for three-dimensional metamaterials or 'stereometamaterials' [N. Liu {\em et al}, Nature Photon. {\bf 3}, 157 (2009)]. We demonstrate that nonlinearity offers more possibilities with respect to real-time tunability and a multiplicity of states which can be reached by varying the external field. Moreover, we demonstrate almost total localization of the energy in one of the resonators in a broad range of parameters.",Human
"Evolving from turbulent states the 2D fluids and the plasmas reach states characterized by a high degree of order, consisting of few vortices. These asymptotic states represent a small subset in the space of functions and are characterised by properties that are difficult to identify in a direct approach. The field theoretical approach to the dynamics and to the asymptotic states of fluids and plasmas in 2D provides a considerable extension of the usual perspective. The present works discusses a series of consequences of the field theoretical approach, when it is applied to particular problems. The discussion is developed around known physical problems: the current density profiles in cylindrical plasma, the density pinch in tokamak and the concentration of vorticity.",Human
"We demonstrate a scheme for optical cycling in the polar, diatomic molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF) using the $X ^2\Sigma^+\toA^2\Pi_{1/2}$ electronic transition. SrF's highly diagonal Franck-Condon factors suppress vibrational branching. We eliminate rotational branching by employing a quasi-cycling $N=1\to N^\prime=0$ type transition in conjunction with magnetic field remixing of dark Zeeman sublevels. We observe cycling fluorescence and deflection through radiative force of an SrF molecular beam using this scheme. With straightforward improvements our scheme promises to allow more than $10^5$ photon scatters, possibly enabling the direct laser cooling of SrF.",Human
"It has long been surmised that the mean-velocity profile (MVP) of a pipe flow is closely related to the spectrum of turbulent energy. Here we perform a spectral analysis to identify the eddies that dominate the production of shear stress via momentum transfer. This analysis allows us to express the MVP as a functional of the spectrum. Each part of the MVP relates to a specific spectral range: the buffer layer to the dissipative range, the log layer to the inertial range, and the wake to the energetic range. The parameters of the spectrum set the thickness of the viscous layer, the amplitude of the buffer layer, and the amplitude of the wake.",Human
"We present an easy, efficient and fast method to generate arbitrary linear combinations of light orbital angular momentum eigenstates $\ell=\pm 2$ starting from a linearly polarized TEM$_{00}$ laser beam. The method exploits the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion capability of a liquid-crystal-based $q$-plate and a Dove prism inserted in a Sagnac polarizing interferometer. The nominal generation efficiency is 100\%, being limited only by reflection and scattering losses in the optical components. When closed paths are followed on the polarization Poincar\'{e} sphere of the input beam, the associated Pancharatnam geometric phase is transferred unchanged to the orbital angular momentum state of the output beam.",Human
"Due to the breaking of gauge symmetry in rotating superfluid Helium, the inertial mass of a vortex diverges with the vortex size. The vortex inertial mass is thus much higher than the classical inertial mass of the vortex core. An equal increase of the vortex gravitational mass is questioned. The possibility that the vortices in a rotating superfluid could break the weak equivalence principle in relation with a variable speed of light in the superfluid vacuum is debated. Experiments to test this possibility are investigated on the bases that superfluid Helium vortices would not fall, under the single influence of a uniform gravitational field, at the same rate as the rest of the superfluid Helium mass.",Human
"Shockwaves provide a useful and rewarding route to the nonequilibrium properties of simple fluids far from equilibrium. For simplicity, we study a strong shockwave in a dense two-dimensional fluid. Here, our study of nonlinear transport properties makes plain the connection between the observed local hydrodynamic variables (like the various gradients and fluxes) and the chosen recipes for defining (or ""measuring"") those variables. The range over which nonlocal hydrodynamic averages are computed turns out to be much more significant than are the other details of the averaging algorithms. The results show clearly the incompatibility of microscopic time-reversible cause-and-effect dynamics with macroscopic instantaneously-irreversible models like the Navier-Stokes equations.",Human
"In this work we report the results concerning calculations for quantum-mechanical rotational transitions in molecular hydrogen, H$_2$, induced by an ultra-cold ground state anti-hydrogen atom $\bar{H}_{1s}$. The calculations are accomplished using a non-reactive close-coupling quantum-mechanical approach. The H$_2$ molecule is treated as a rigid rotor. The total elastic scattering cross section $\sigma_{el}(\epsilon)$ at energy $\epsilon$, state-resolved rotational transition cross sections $\sigma_{jj'}(\epsilon)$ between states $j$ and $j'$ and corresponding thermal rate coefficients $k_{jj'}(T)$ are computed in the temperature range 0.004 K $ \lesssim T \lesssim$ 4 K. Satisfactory agreement with other calculations (variational) has been obtained for $\sigma_{el}(\epsilon)$.",Human
"The Galaxy Zoo citizen science website invites anyone with an Internet connection to participate in research by classifying galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As of April 2009, more than 200,000 volunteers had made more than 100 million galaxy classifications. In this paper, we present results of a pilot study into the motivations and demographics of Galaxy Zoo volunteers, and define a technique to determine motivations from free responses that can be used in larger multiple-choice surveys with similar populations. Our categories form the basis for a future survey, with the goal of determining the prevalence of each motivation.",Human
"This paper offers a study of oxygen dissolution into a solid, and its consequences on the mechanical behaviour of the material. In fact, mechanical strains strongly influence the oxidation processes and may be, in some materials, responsible for cracking. To realize this study, mechanical considerations are introduced into the classical diffusion laws. Simulations were made for the particular case of uranium dioxide, which undergoes the chemical fragmentation. According to our simulations, the hypothesis of a compression stress field into the oxidised UO2 compound near the internal interface is consistent with some oxidation mechanisms of oxidation experimentally observed. More generally, this work will be extended to the simulation to an oxide layer growth on a metallic substrate.",Human
"In this work we have studied a new functional for the correlation energy obtained from the exact-exchange (EXX) approximation within time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Correlation energies have been calculated for a number of different atoms showing excellent agreement with results from more sophisticated methods. These results loose little accuracy by approximating the EXX kernel by its static value, a procedure which enormously simplifies the calculations. The correlation potential, obtained by taking the functional derivative with respect to the density, turns out to be remarkably accurate for all atoms studied. This potential has been used to calculate ionization potentials, static polarizabilities and van der Waals coefficients with results in close agreement with experiment.",Human
"The blogosphere can be construed as a knowledge network made of bloggers who are interacting through a social network to share, exchange or produce information. We claim that the social and semantic dimensions are essentially co-determined and propose to investigate the co-evolutionary dynamics of the blogosphere by examining two intertwined issues: First, how does knowledge distribution drive new interactions and thus influence the social network topology? Second, which role structural network properties play in the information circulation in the system? We adopt an empirical standpoint by analyzing the semantic and social activity of a portion of the US political blogosphere, monitored on a period of four months.",Human
"It is an ever-growing challenge to develop nano-devices for controlling energy transport. An open question is whether we can create and control heat current at {\it strict zero thermal bias}, and if yes, how to do it. In this paper, we demonstrate that a nonlinear asymmetric system, when pushed out of equilibrium, can produce heat current in the absence of a thermal bias. The emergence and control of heat current over a broad range of parameters are studied. Our results reveal the following three necessary conditions: non-equilibrium source, symmetry breaking, and nonlinearity. We also demonstrate that when heat baths are correlated, symmetry breaking is sufficient to generate heat current.",Human
"Prototypes of MICROMEGAS chambers, using bulk technology and analog readout, with 1x1cm2 readout segmentation have been built and tested. Measurements in Ar/iC4H10 (95/5) and Ar/CO2 (80/20) are reported. The dependency of the prototypes gas gain versus pressure, gas temperature and amplification gap thickness variations has been measured with an 55Fe source and a method for temperature and pressure correction of data is presented. A stack of four chambers has been tested in 200GeV/c and 7GeV/c muon and pion beams respectively. Measurements of response uniformity, detection efficiency and hit multiplicity are reported. A bulk MICROMEGAS prototype with embedded digital readout electronics has been assembled and tested. The chamber layout and first results are presented.",Human
"State selective field ionization detection techniques in physics require a specific progression through a complicated atomic state space to optimize state selectivity and overall efficiency. For large principle quantum number n, the theoretical models become computationally intractable and any results are often rendered irrelevant by small deviations from ideal experimental conditions, for example external electromagnetic fields. Several different proposals for quantum information processing rely heavily upon the quality of these detectors. In this paper, we show a proof of principle that it is possible to optimize experimental field profiles in situ by running a genetic algorithm to control aspects of the experiment itself. A simple experiment produced novel results that are consistent with analyses of existing results.",Human
"Much work has been devoted, during the past twenty years, to using complexity to protect elections from manipulation and control. Many results have been obtained showing NP-hardness shields, and recently there has been much focus on whether such worst-case hardness protections can be bypassed by frequently correct heuristics or by approximations. This paper takes a very different approach: We argue that when electorates follow the canonical political science model of societal preferences the complexity shield never existed in the first place. In particular, we show that for electorates having single-peaked preferences, many existing NP-hardness results on manipulation and control evaporate.",Human
"We describe the fabrication and characterization of a new surface-electrode Paul ion trap designed for experiments in scalable quantum information processing with Ca+. A notable feature is a symmetric electrode pattern which allows rotation of the normal modes of ion motion, yielding efficient Doppler cooling with a single beam parallel to the planar surface. We propose and implement a technique for micromotion compensation in all directions using an infrared repumper laser beam directed into the trap plane. Finally, we employ an alternate repumping scheme that increases ion fluorescence and simplifies heating rate measurements obtained by time-resolved ion fluorescence during Doppler cooling.",Human
"The entanglement between Gaussian entangled states can be increased by non-Gaussian operations. We design a new scheme named coherent photon addition, which can coherently add one photon generated by spontaneous parametric down conversation process to Gaussian quadrature-entangled light pulses created by a non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier. This operation can increase the entanglement of input two-mode Gaussian states as an entanglement distillation, and provides us a new method of non-Gaussian operation. This scheme can also help us to study the decoherence of adding one to two-mode Gaussian states from coherent photon addition to normal photon addition.",Human
"We present a theory for Fano interference in light scattering by individual obstacle, based on a temporal coupled-mode formalism. This theory is applicable for obstacles that are much smaller than the incident wavelength, or for systems with two-dimensional cylindrical or three-dimensional spherical symmetry. We show that for each angle momentum channel, the Fano interference effect can be modeled by a simple temporal coupled-mode equation, which provides a line shape formula for scattering and absorption cross-section. We validate the analysis with numerical simulations. As an application of the theory, we design a structure that exhibits strong absorption and weak scattering properties at the same frequency.",Human
"The KATRIN experiment is going to search for the mass of the electron antineutrino down to 0.2 eV/c^2. In order to reach this sensitivity the background rate has to be understood and minimised to 0.01 counts per second. One of the background sources is the unavoidable Penning trap for electrons due to the combination of the electric and magnetic fields between the pre- and the main spectrometer at KATRIN. In this article we will show that by sweeping a conducting wire periodically through such a particle trap stored particles can be removed, an ongoing discharge in the trap can be stopped, and the count rate measured with a detector looking at the trap is reduced.",Human
"We consider propagation of light pulses detuned from the atomic resonance in a dense two-level medium and photonic structures with it. The large density of the medium is important to decrease spatial scale of such nonlinear effects as pulse compression, though it does not provide any fundamentally new phenomena as compared to dilute media. Frequency detuning decreases the effectivity of such nonlinear phenomena as pulse compression and dispersion spreading compensation as well. We propose simple logic gates based on interaction between two pulses in one-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal. It turned out, that frequency detuning is necessary to obtain ultrafast AND gate, while OR and NOT gates can be realized in the system without detuning.",Human
"We present two types of metamaterial-based spectral bandpass filters for the terahertz (THz) frequency range. The metamaterials are specifically designed to operate for waves at normal incidence and to be independent of the field polarization. The functional structures are embedded in films of benzocyclobutene (BCB) resulting in large-area, free-standing and flexible membranes with low intrinsic loss.   The proposed filters are investigated by THz time-domain spectroscopy and show a pronounced transmission peak with over 80]% amplitude transmission in the passband and a transmission rejection down to the noise level in the stopbands. The measurements are supported by numerical simulations which evidence that the high transmission response is related to the excitation of trapped modes.",Human
"By tailoring the wavefront of the laser pulse used in a laser-wakefield accelerator, we show that the properties of the x-rays produced due to the electron beam's betatron oscillations in the plasma can be controlled. By creating a wavefront with coma, we find that the critical energy of the synchrotron-like x-ray spectrum can be significantly increased. The coma does not substantially change the energy of the electron beam, but does increase its divergence and produces an energy-dependent exit angle, indicating that changes in the x-ray spectrum are due to an increase in the electron beam's oscillation amplitude within the wakefield.",Human
"A theoretical study of the intense-field single ionization of molecular hydrogen or deuterium oriented either parallel or perpendicular to a linear polarized laser pulse (400 nm) is performed for different internuclear separations and pulse lengths in an intensity range of $(2-13)\times10^{13} $W cm$^{-2}$. The investigation is based on a non-perturbative treatment that solves the full time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation of both correlated electrons within the fixed-nuclei and the dipole approximation. The results for various internuclear separations are used to obtain the ionization yields of molecular hydrogen and deuterium in their ground vibrational states. An atomic model is used to identify the influence of the intrinsic diatomic two-center character of the problem.",Human
"We present our response to Pierre Thibault's article, titled ""Feasibility of 3D reconstruction from a single 2D diffraction measurement"" [1], in which he commented upon our recent ankylography paper [2]. While we appreciate Thibault's efforts in promoting further reflection on our paper, we found serious errors both in his understanding and analysis of ankylography: he inaccurately presented the oversampling scheme in ankylography, incorrectly described our reconstruction algorithm and our experiment, and formulated arguments based upon a flawed and overly-restrictive theoretical analysis. Therefore, we conclude that his main claims are either scientifically invalid or a misrepresentation of our claims about ankylography. Below is our detailed point-by-point response to his criticisms.",Human
"Recent measurements on high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from N$_2$ aligned perpendicular to the driving laser polarization [B. K. McFarland {\it el al}, Science {\bf 322}, 1232 (2008)] have shown a maximum at the rotational half-revival. This has been interpreted as the signature of the HHG contribution from the molecular orbital just below the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). By using the recently developed quantitative rescattering theory combined with accurate photoionization transition dipoles, we show that the maximum at the rotational half-revival is indeed associated with the HOMO-1 contribution. Our results also show that the HOMO-1 contribution becomes increasingly more important near the HHG cutoff and therefore depends on the laser intensity.",Human
"We study the consequences which the presence of an elementary electric charge in mu^(+-) and pi^(+-) has for the rest mass of mu^(+-) and pi^(+-). The addition of the electric charges e^(+-) to the massive neutral bodies of these particles does not increase the energy in the rest mass of the muon and pion, but rather decreases their energy by the binding energy of the electric charge to the neutral bodies of the muon and pion. The addition of a charge to the neutral neutrino lattices of the muon or pion changes the simple cubic lattices of the neutral particles to face-centered cubic lattices of the charged particles, which is essential for the stability of the particles.",Human
"This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the Standard Model backgrounds based on modifying Monte Carlo predictions within their systematic uncertainties. The improved background model is obtained by altering the original predictions with successively more complex correction functions in signal-free control selections. Statistical tests indicate when sufficient compatibility with data is reached. In this way, systematic effects are absorbed into the new background model. The same correction is then applied on the Monte Carlo prediction in the signal region. Comparing this method to other background estimation techniques shows improvements with respect to statistical and systematical uncertainties. The proposed method can also be applied in other fields beyond high energy physics.",Human
"The spatially-temporal model of an all-solid-state passively Q-switched oscillator with an active medium providing the stimulated Raman scattering is presented. The model does not presume a Gaussian shape of the cylindrically symmetric modes at both fundamental and Stokes wavelengths. It is found, that the highly-nontrivial spatially-temporal dynamics can be regularized by the optimal choice of the oscillator parameters, viz. initial transmission of a saturable absorber, curvature of a spherical mirror, and output mirror transmission at the fundamental and Stokes wavelengths. As a result, the pulse can be substantially temporally squeezed and spatially broadened at both fundamental and Stokes wavelengths.",Human
"This paper investigates the radiation properties of two coupled split-ring resonators (SRRs). Due to electromagnetic coupling, two hybrid magnetic plasmon modes were induced in the structure. Our calculations show that the radiation loss of the structure was greatly suppressed by the hybridization effect. This led to a remarkable increase in the Q-factor of the coupled system compared to the single SRR. By adjusting the distance between the two SRRs, the Q-factor changed correspondingly due to different electromagnetic coupling strengths. This resulted in a coupled structure that functioned as a new type of nanocavity with an adjustable Q-factor.",Human
"A solid object impacting on liquid creates a liquid jet due to the collapse of the impact cavity. Using visualization experiments with smoke particles and multiscale simulations we show that in addition a high-speed air-jet is pushed out of the cavity. Despite an impact velocity of only 1 m/s, this air-jet attains \emph{supersonic} speeds already when the cavity is slightly larger than 1 mm in diameter. The structure of the air flow resembles closely that of compressible flow through a nozzle -- with the key difference that here the ""nozzle"" is a \emph{liquid} cavity shrinking rapidly in time.",Human
In recognition of the highly non-trivial task of computation of the inverse Hasimoto transformation mapping the intrinsic geometric parameter space onto the extrinsic vortex filament coordinate space a reformulation of the Da Rios-Betchov equations in the latter space is given. The nonlinear localized vortex filament structure solution given by the present formulation is in detailed agreement with the Betchov-Hasimoto solution in the small-amplitude limit and is also in qualitative agreement with laboratory experiment observations of helical-twist solitary waves propagating on concentrated vortices in rotating fluids. The present formulation also provides for a discernible effect of the slipping motion of a vortex filament on the vortex evolution.,Human
"We derive an analytical expression for the critical infection rate r_c of the susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) disease spreading model on random networks. To obtain r_c, we first calculate the probability of reinfection, pi, defined as the probability of a node to reinfect the node that had earlier infected it. We then derive r_c from pi using percolation theory. We show that pi is governed by two effects: (i) The requirement from an infecting node to recover prior to its reinfection, which depends on the disease spreading parameters; and (ii) The competition between nodes that simultaneously try to reinfect the same ancestor, which depends on the network topology.",Human
"Thermal expansion, or dilation, is closely related to the specific heat, and provides useful information regarding material properties. The accurate measurement of dilation in confined spaces coupled with other limiting experimental environments such as low temperatures and rapidly changing high magnetic fields requires a new sensitive millimeter size dilatometer that has little or no temperature and field dependence. We have designed an ultra compact dilatometer using an atomic force microscope (AFM) piezoresistive cantilever as the sensing element and demonstrated its versatility by studying the charge density waves (CDWs) in alpha uranium to high magnetic fields (up to 31 T). The performance of this piezoresistive dilatometer was comparable to that of a titanium capacitive dilatometer.",Human
"A cosmological model is proposed which uses a causality argument to solve the homogeneity and entropy problems of cosmology. In this model a chronology violating region of spacetime causally precedes the remainder of the Universe, and a theorem establishes the existence of time functions precisely outside the chronology violating region. This model is shown to nicely reproduce Augustine of Hippo's thought on time and the beginning of the Universe. In the model the spacelike boundary representing the Big Bang is replaced by a null hypersurface at which the gravitational degrees of freedom are almost frozen while the matter and radiation content is highly homogeneous and thermalized.",Human
"Recently developed analytic approximation for the equation of state of fully ionized nonideal electron-ion plasma mixtures [Potekhin et al., Phys. Rev. E, 79, 016411 (2009); arXiv:0812.4344], which covers the transition between the weak and strong Coulomb coupling regimes and reproduces numerical results obtained in the hypernetted chain (HNC) approximation, is modified in order to fit the small deviations from the linear mixing in the strong coupling regime, revealed by recent Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, a mixing rule is proposed for the regime of weak coupling, which generalizes post-Debye density corrections to the case of mixtures and numerically agrees with the HNC approximation in that regime.",Human
"Using the parallel tempering algorithm and GPU accelerated techniques, we have performed large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model on a square lattice with antiferromagnetic (repulsive) nearest-neighbor(NN) and next-nearest-neighbor(NNN) interactions of the same strength and subject to a uniform magnetic field. Both transitions from the (2x1) and row-shifted (2x2) ordered phases to the paramagnetic phase are continuous. From our data analysis, reentrance behavior of the (2x1) critical line and a bicritical point which separates the two ordered phases at T=0 are confirmed. Based on the critical exponents we obtained along the phase boundary, Suzuki's weak universality seems to hold.",Human
"We consider models of relativistic matter containing sharp interfaces across which the matter model changes. These models will be relevant for neutron stars with crusts, phase transitions, or for viscous boundaries where the length scale is too short to be modelled smoothly. In particular we look at numerical techniques that allow us to evolve stable interfaces, for the interfaces to merge, and for strong waves and shocks to interact with the interfaces. We test these techniques for ideal hydrodynamics in special and general relativity for simple equations of state, finding that simple level set-based methods extend well to relativistic hydrodynamics.",Human
"We propose a model for protein folding in vivo based on a Brownian-ratchet mechanism in the multidimensional energy landscape space. The device is able to produce directed transport taking advantage of the assumed intrinsic asymmetric properties of the proteins and employing the consumption of energy provided by an external source. Through such a directed transport phenomenon, the polypeptide finds the native state starting from any initial state in the energy landscape with great efficacy and robustness, even in the presence of different type of obstacles. This model solves Levinthal's paradox without requiring biased transition probabilities but at the expense of opening the system to an external field.",Human
"We present an advanced interpolation method for estimating smooth spatiotemporal profiles for local highway traffic variables such as flow, speed and density. The method is based on stationary detector data as typically collected by traffic control centres, and may be augmented by floating car data or other traffic information. The resulting profiles display transitions between free and congested traffic in great detail, as well as fine structures such as stop-and-go waves. We establish the accuracy and robustness of the method and demonstrate three potential applications: 1. compensation for gaps in data caused by detector failure; 2. separation of noise from dynamic traffic information; and 3. the fusion of floating car data with stationary detector data.",Human
"We discuss the possibility to use a high energy neutrino beam from a muon storage ring to provide one way communication with a submerged submarine. Neutrino interactions produce muons which can be detected either, directly when they pass through the submarine or by their emission of Cerenkov light in sea water, which, in turn, can be exploited with sensitive photo detectors. Due to the very high neutrino flux from a muon storage ring, it is sufficient to mount either detection system directly onto the hull of the submersible. The achievable data transfer rates compare favorable with existing technologies and do allow for a communication at the usual speed and depth of submarines.",Human
"Identifying and modeling patterns of human activity has important ramifications in applications ranging from predicting disease spread to optimizing resource allocation. Because of its relevance and availability, written correspondence provides a powerful proxy for studying human activity. One school of thought is that human correspondence is driven by responses to received correspondence, a view that requires distinct response mechanism to explain e-mail and letter correspondence observations. Here, we demonstrate that, like e-mail correspondence, the letter correspondence patterns of 16 writers, performers, politicians, and scientists are well-described by the circadian cycle, task repetition and changing communication needs. We confirm the universality of these mechanisms by properly rescaling letter and e-mail correspondence statistics to reveal their underlying similarity.",Human
We report integration of an InAs quantum well micro-Hall sensor with microfluidics and real-time detection of moving superparamagnetic beads for biological applications. The detected positive and negative signals correspond to beads moving within and around the Hall cross area respectively. Relative magnitudes and polarities of the signals measured for a random distribution of immobilized beads over the sensor are in good agreement with calculated values and explain consistently the dynamic signal shape. The fast sensor response and its high sensitivity to off-cross area beads demonstrate its capability for dynamic detection of biomolecules and long-range monitoring of non-specific binding events.,Human
"We first study the influence of an efficient feedback strategy named prediction feedback strategy (PFS) based on a multi-route scenario in which dynamic information can be generated and displayed on the board to guide road users to make a choice. In this scenario, our model incorporates the effects of adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow. Simulation results adopting this optimal information feedback strategy have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the other three information feedback strategies, i.e., vehicle number and flux. At the end of this paper, we also discuss in what situation PFS will become invalid in multi-route systems.",Human
"Perfect imaging has been believed to rely on negative refraction, but here we show that an ordinary positively-refracting optical medium may form perfect images as well. In particular, we establish a mathematical proof that Maxwell's fish eye in two-dimensional integrated optics makes a perfect instrument with a resolution not limited by the wavelength of light. We also show how to modify the fish eye such that perfect imaging devices can be made in practice. Our method of perfect focusing may also find applications outside of optics, in acoustics, fluid mechanics or quantum physics, wherever waves obey the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation.",Human
"The article deals with the detection efficiency of UV-photon detectors consisting of Thick Gas Electron Multipliers (THGEM) coated with CsI photocathode, operated in atmospheric Ne/CH4 and Ne/CF4 mixtures. We report on the photoelectron extraction efficiency from the photocathode into these gas mixtures, and on the photoelectron collection efficiency into the THGEM holes. Full collection efficiency was reached in all gases investigated, in some cases at relatively low multiplication. High total detector gains for UV photons, in excess of 10^5, were reached at relatively low operation voltages with a single THGEM element. We discuss the photon detection efficiency in the context of possible application to RICH.",Human
"In this paper we describe a way to achieve the extraordinary transmission regime from sub-wavelength slits carved on semiconductor substrates. Unlike metals, the dielectric permittivity of typical semiconductors like GaAs or GaP is negative beginning in the extreme UV range (lambda <= 270nm). We show that the metal-like response of bulk semiconductors exhibits surface plasmon waves that lead to extraordinary transmission in the UV and soft X-ray ranges. The importance of realistic material response versus perfect conductors is also discussed. These findings may be important in high resolution photo-lithography, near field optical devices and ultra high density optical storage.",Human
"We demonstrate Doppler-free saturated absorption spectroscopy of cold molecular radicals formed by laser ablation inside a cryogenic buffer gas cell. By lowering the temperature, congested regions of the spectrum can be simplified, and by using different temperatures for different regions of the spectrum a wide range of rotational states can be studied optimally. We use the technique to study the optical spectrum of YbF radicals with a resolution of 30 MHz, measuring the magnetic hyperfine parameters of the electronic ground state. The method is suitable for high resolution spectroscopy of a great variety of molecules at controlled temperature and pressure, and is particularly well-suited to those that are difficult to produce in the gas phase.",Human
"We compare the explicitly correlated Hylleraas and exponential basis sets in the evaluations of ground state of Li and Be$^+$. Calculations with Hylleraas functions are numerically stable and can be performed with the large number of basis functions. Our results for ground state energies $-7.478 060 323 910 10(32)$, $-14.324 763 176 790 43(22)$ of Li and Be$^+$ correspondingly, are the most accurate to date. When small basis set is considered, explicitly correlated exponential functions are much more effective. With only 128 functions we obtained about $10^{-9}$ relative accuracy, but the severe numerical instabilities make this basis costly in the evaluation.",Human
"The geometric structure of the Rh$_8^+$ cation is investigated using a combination of far-infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetic ordering of the different structural motifs is found to depend sensitively on the choice of pure or hybrid exchange functionals. Comparison of experimental and calculated spectra suggests the cluster to have a close-packed, bicapped octahedral structure, in contrast to recent predictions of a cubic structure for the neutral cluster. Our findings demonstrate the importance of including some exact exchange contributions in the DFT calculations, via hybrid functionals, when applied to rhodium clusters, and cast doubt on the application of pure functionals for late transition metal clusters in general.",Human
"In this study, we investigate the appeared complexity of two-phase flow (air/water) in a heterogeneous soil where the supposed porous media is non-deformable media which is under the timedependent gas pressure. After obtaining of governing equations and considering the capillary pressuresaturation and permeability functions, the evolution of the model unknown parameters were obtained. In this way, using COMSOL (FEMLAB) and fluid flow/script Module, the role of heterogeneity in intrinsic permeability was analysed. Also, the evolution of relative permeability of wetting and non-wetting fluid, capillary pressure and other parameters were elicited. In the last part, a complex network approach to analysis of emerged patterns will be employed.",Human
"It can be computationally advantageous to perform computer simulations in a Lorentz boosted frame for a certain class of systems. However, even if the computer model relies on a covariant set of equations, it has been pointed out that algorithmic difficulties related to discretization errors may have to be overcome in order to take full advantage of the potential speedup. We summarize the findings, the difficulties and their solutions, and show that the technique enables simulations important to several areas of accelerator physics that are otherwise problematic, including self-consistent modeling in three-dimensions of laser wakefield accelerator stages at energies of 10 GeV and above.",Human
"We demonstrate tunable frequency-converted light mediated by a chi-(2) nonlinear photonic crystal nanocavity. The wavelength-scale InP-based cavity supports two closely-spaced localized modes near 1550 nm which are resonantly excited by a 130 fs laser pulse. The cavity is simultaneously irradiated with a non-resonant probe beam, giving rise to rich second-order scattering spectra reflecting nonlinear mixing of the different resonant and non-resonant components. In particular, we highlight the radiation at the sum frequencies of the probe beam and the respective cavity modes. This would be a useful, minimally-invasive monitor of the joint occupancy state of multiple cavities in an integrated optical circuit.",Human
"This is not a new result. Purpose of this work is to describe a method to search the analytical expression of the general real solution of the two-dimensional Laplace differential equation. This thing is not easy to find in scientific literature and, if present, often it is justified with the assertion that an arbitrary analytic complex function is a solution of Laplace equation, so introducing the condition of complex-differentiability which is not really necessary for the existence of a real solution. The question of the knowledge of real exact solutions to Laplace equation is of great importance in science and engineering.",Human
"Vertex detectors at future hadron colliders will need to cope with large particle fluences. Diamond is a particularly radiation hard material and exhibits further properties that makes it an attractive material for such detectors. Within the RD42 collaboration several chemical vapor deposition diamond samples are being studied in the form of strip and pixel detectors. While the quality of the poly-crystalline diamond samples is constantly increasing and the feasibility of producing wafers has been demonstrated, recently a single-crystal diamond pixel detector has been assembled and characterized in a 100 GeV particle beam at CERN. Results on performance, detection efficiency, spatial resolution and charge collection are reported here together with the latest radiation damage studies.",Human
"We argue that a restriction determined by a drawn card or quantum random numbers, on the running of LHC (Large Hadron Collider), which was proposed in earlier articles by us, can only result in an, at first, apparent success whatever the outcome. This previous work was concerned with looking for backward causation and/or influence from the future, which, in our previous model, was assumed to have the effect of arranging bad luck for large Higgs producing machines, such as LHC and the never finished SSC (Superconducting Super Collider) stopped by Congress because of such bad luck, so as not to allow them to work.",Human
"A Particle-in-Cell (PIC) numerical simulation of the electron Weibel instability is applied in a frame of Darwin (radiationless) approximation of the self-consistent fields of sparse plasma. As a result, we were able to supplement the classical picture of the instability and, in particular, to obtain the dependency of the basic characteristics (the time of development and the maximum field energy) of the thermal anisotropy parameter, to trace the dynamic restructuring of current filaments accompanying the nonlinear stage of the instability and to trace in detail the evolution of the initial anisotropy of the electron component of plasma.",Human
"The non-local van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] is a very promising scheme for the efficient treatment of dispersion bonded systems. We show here that the accuracy of vdW-DF can be dramatically improved both for dispersion and hydrogen bonded complexes through the judicious selection of its underlying exchange functional. New and published exchange functionals are identified that deliver much better than chemical accuracy from vdW-DF for the S22 benchmark set of weakly interacting dimers and for water clusters. Improved performance for the adsorption of water on salt is also obtained.",Human
"We present two methods for reducing multidimensional information to one dimension for ease of understand or analysis while maintaining statistical power. While not new, dimensional reduction is not greatly used in high-energy physics and has applications whenever there is a distinctive feature (for instance, a mass peak) in one variable but when signal purity depends on others; so in practice in most of the areas of physics analysis. While both methods presented here assume knowledge of the background, they differ in the fact that only one of the methods uses a model for the signal, trading some increase in statistical power for this model dependence.",Human
"A heat engine operating on the basis of the Carnot cycle is considered, where the mechanical work performed is dissipated within the engine at the temperature of the warmer isotherm and the resulting heat is added to the engine together with an external heat input. The resulting work performed by the engine per cycle is increased at the expense of dissipated work produced in the previous cycle. It is shown that such a dissipative heat engine is thermodynamically inconsistent violating the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The existing physical models employing the dissipative heat engine concept, in particular, the heat engine model of hurricane development, are physically invalid.",Human
"By a computer simulation approach we study the scattering of $p$- or $s$-polarized light from a two-dimensional, randomly rough, perfectly conducting surface. The pair of coupled inhomogeneous integral equations for two independent tangential components of the magnetic field on the surface are converted into matrix equations by the method of moments, which are then solved by the biconjugate gradient stabilized method. The solutions are used to calculate the mean differential reflection coefficient for given angles of incidence and specified polarizations of the incident and scattered fields. The full angular distribution of the intensity of the scattered light is obtained for strongly randomly rough surfaces by a rigorous computer simulation approach.",Human
"We describe the design and function of a circular magnetic waveguide produced from wires on a microchip for atom interferometry using deBroglie waves. The guide is a two-dimensional magnetic minimum for trapping weak-field seeking states of atoms or molecules with a magnetic dipole moment. The design consists of seven circular wires sharing a common radius. We describe the design, the time-dependent currents of the wires and show that it is possible to form a circular waveguide with adjustable height and gradient while minimizing perturbation resulting from leads or wire crossings. This maximal area geometry is suited for rotation sensing with atom interferometry via the Sagnac effect using either cold atoms, molecules and Bose-condensed systems.",Human
"The treatment of the time-independent Schrodinger equation in real-space is an indispensable part of introductory quantum mechanics. In contrast, the Schrodinger equation in momentum space is an integral equation that is not readily amenable to an analytical solution and is rarely taught. We present a numerical approach to the Schrodinger equation in momentum space. After a suitable discretization process, we obtain the Hamiltonian matrix and diagonalize it numerically. By considering a few examples, we show that this approach is ideal for exploring bound-states in a localized potential and complements the traditional (analytical or numerical) treatment of the Schrodinger equation in real-space.",Human
"Flying insects execute aerial maneuvers through subtle manipulations of their wing motions. Here, we measure the free flight kinematics of fruit flies and determine how they modulate their wing pitching to induce sharp turns. By analyzing the torques these insects exert to pitch their wings, we infer that the wing hinge acts as a torsional spring that passively resists the wing's tendency to flip in response to aerodynamic and inertial forces. To turn, the insects asymmetrically change the spring rest angles to generate rowing motions of their wings. Thus, insects can generate these maneuvers using only a slight active actuation that biases their wing motion.",Human
"The first part of this paper is a condensed synthesis of the matter presented in several previous ones. It begins with an argumentation showing that the first and second laws of thermodynamics are incompatible with one another if they are not connected to relativity. The solution proposed consists of inserting the Einstein mass-energy relation into a general equation that associates both laws.   The second part deals with some consequences of this new insight and its possible link with gravitation. Despite a slight modification of the usual reasoning, the suggested hypothesis leads to a simplification and extension of the thermodynamic theory and to the idea that relativity is omnipresent around us.",Human
"A compact and fast electromagnetic calorimeter prototype was designed, built, and tested in preparation for a next-generation, high-rate muon g-2 experiment. It uses a simple assembly procedure: alternating layers of 0.5-mm-thick tungsten plates and 0.5-mm-diameter plastic scintillating fiber ribbons. This geometry leads to a detector having a calculated radiation length of 0.69 cm, a Moliere radius of 1.73 cm, and a measured intrinsic sampling resolution term of (11.8\pm1.1)/\sqrt{E(GeV)}, in the range 1.5 to 3.5 GeV. The construction procedure, test beam results, and GEANT-4 comparative simulations are described.",Human
"We study the shrinking Pearson random walk in two dimensions and greater, in which the direction of the Nth is random and its length equals lambda^{N-1}, with lambda<1. As lambda increases past a critical value lambda_c, the endpoint distribution in two dimensions, P(r), changes from having a global maximum away from the origin to being peaked at the origin. The probability distribution for a single coordinate, P(x), undergoes a similar transition, but exhibits multiple maxima on a fine length scale for lambda close to lambda_c. We numerically determine P(r) and P(x) by applying a known algorithm that accurately inverts the exact Bessel function product form of the Fourier transform for the probability distributions.",Human
"We consider the evolutionary dynamics of a cooperative game on an adaptive network, where the strategies of agents (cooperation or defection) feed back on their local interaction topology. While mutual cooperation is the social optimum, unilateral defection yields a higher payoff and undermines the evolution of cooperation. Although no a priori advantage is given to cooperators, an intrinsic dynamical mechanism can lead asymptotically to a state of full cooperation. In finite systems, this state is characterized by long periods of strong cooperation interrupted by sudden episodes of predominant defection, suggesting a possible mechanism for the systemic failure of cooperation in real-world systems.",Human
"We develop an analytic model of vector correlations in rotationally inelastic atom-diatom collisions and test it against the much examined Ar--NO ($\mathbf X^2 \Pi$) system. Based on the Fraunhofer scattering of matter waves, the model furnishes complex scattering amplitudes needed to evaluate the polarization moments characterizing the quantum stereodynamics. The analytic polarization moments are found to be in an excellent agreement with experimental results and with close-coupling calculations available at thermal energies. The model reveals that the stereodynamics is governed by diffraction from the repulsive core of the Ar--NO potential, which can be characterized by a single Legendre moment.",Human
We report on an experimental study of the dynamics of the reflection of ultracold atoms from a periodic one-dimensional magnetic lattice potential. The magnetic lattice potential of period 10 \textmu m is generated by applying a uniform bias magnetic field to a microfabricated periodic structure on a silicon wafer coated with a multilayered TbGdFeCo/Cr magneto-optical film. The effective thickness of the magnetic film is about 960 nm. A detailed study of the profile of the reflected atoms as a function of externally induced periodic corrugation in the potential is described. The effect of angle of incidence is investigated in detail. The experimental observations are supported by numerical simulations.,Human
"We introduce a class of interatomic potential models that can be automatically generated from data consisting of the energies and forces experienced by atoms, derived from quantum mechanical calculations. The resulting model does not have a fixed functional form and hence is capable of modeling complex potential energy landscapes. It is systematically improvable with more data. We apply the method to bulk carbon, silicon and germanium and test it by calculating properties of the crystals at high temperatures. Using the interatomic potential to generate the long molecular dynamics trajectories required for such calculations saves orders of magnitude in computational cost.",Human
"A reflection model with three components, a specular spike, a specular lobe and a diffuse lobe is discussed. This model was successfully applied to describe reflection of xenon scintillation light (175 nm) by PTFE and other fluoropolymers and can be used for Monte Carlo simulation and analysis of scintillation detectors. The measured data favors a Trowbridge-Reitz distribution function of ellipsoidal micro-surfaces. The intensity of the coherent reflection increases with increasing angle of incidence, as expected, since the surface appears smoother at grazing angles. The total reflectance obtained for PTFE is about 70% for VUV light at normal incidence in vacuum and estimated to be up to 100% in contact with liquid xenon.",Human
"Making use of the octonion operator, the electromagnetic field generates an adjoint field theoretically. The source of adjoint field includes the adjoint charge and the adjoint current. The adjoint charge has an impact on the gravitational mass and the mass distribution in the electromagnetic field with its adjoint field, and causes further the predictions to departure slightly from the conservation of mass. The inferences can explain why the adjoint charge will influence the mass distribution in the gravitational field and electromagnetic field of celestial bodies. And then the adjoint charge can be considered as one kind of candidate for the dark matter.",Human
"We propose a deterministic weighted scale-free small-world model for considering pseudofractal web with the coevolution of topology and weight. In the model, we have the degree distribution exponent $\gamma$ restricted to a range between 2 and 3, simultaneously tunable with two parameters. At the same time, we provide a relatively complete view of topological structure and weight dynamics characteristics of the networks: weight and strength distribution; degree correlations; average clustering coefficient and degree-cluster correlations; as well as the diameter. We show that our model is particularly effective at mimicing weighted scale-free small-world networks with a high and relatively stable clustering coefficient, which rapidly decline with the network size in most previous models.",Human
"A modularity-specialized label propagation algorithm (LPAm) for detecting network communities was recently proposed. This promising algorithm offers some desirable qualities. However, LPAm favors community divisions where all communities are similar in total degree and thus it is prone to get stuck in poor local maxima in the modularity space. To escape local maxima, we employ a multistep greedy agglomerative algorithm (MSG) that can merge multiple pairs of communities at a time. Combining LPAm and MSG, we propose an advanced modularity-specialized label propagation algorithm (LPAm+). Experiments show that LPAm+ successfully detects communities with higher modularity values than ever reported in two commonly used real-world networks. Moreover, LPAm+ offers a fair compromise between accuracy and speed.",Human
This fluid dynamics video shows the release of a 1/15th scale model store into a Mach 1.5 free-stream flow from a rectangular cavity. The images were acquired with a high-speed schlieren photography system using a Photron Ultima APX camera. Acoustic measurements showed that the unsteady shear layer over the cavity had a prominent oscillation at approximately 810 Hz which corresponds to fluctuations seen in the cavity's leading edge shock structure in the video. The video demonstrates the similarity in the time scales of the flow field dynamics and the residence time of the store in the shear layer.,Human
"Third harmonic cavities have been designed and fabricated by FNAL to be used at the FLASH/XFEL facility at DESY to minimise the energy spread along the bunches. Modes in these cavities are analysed and the sensitivity to frequency errors are assessed. A circuit model is employed to model the monopole bands. The monopole circuit model is enhanced to include successive cell coupling, in addition to the usual nearest neighbour coupling. A mode matching code is used to facilitate rapid simulations, incorporating fabrication errors. Curves surfaces are approximated by a series of abrupt transitions and the validity of this approach is examined",Human
"There is much disagreement concerning how best to control global carbon emissions. We explore quantitatively how different control schemes affect the collective emission dynamics of a population of emitting entities. We uncover a complex trade-off which arises between average emissions (affecting the global climate), peak pollution levels (affecting citizens' everyday health), industrial efficiency (affecting the nation's economy), frequency of institutional intervention (affecting governmental costs), common information (affecting trading behavior) and market volatility (affecting financial stability). Our findings predict that a self-organized free-market approach at the level of a sector, state, country or continent, can provide better control than a top-down regulated scheme in terms of market volatility and monthly pollution peaks.",Human
"In previous papers we have shown that scattering of spacecraft nucleons from dark matter gravitationally bound to the earth gives a possible explanation of the flyby velocity anomalies. In addition to flyby velocity changes arising from the average over the scattering cross section of the collision-induced nucleon velocity change, there will be spacecraft temperature increases arising from the mean squared fluctuation of the collision-induced velocity change. We give here a quantitative treatment of this effect, and suggest that careful calorimetry on spacecraft traversing the region below 70,000 km where the flyby velocity changes take place could verify, or at a minimum place significant constraints, on the dark matter scattering model.",Human
"The goal of this investigation is to study, in the line of previous works, the level of velocity fluctuations in different scenarios of the TJ-II stellarator. The method followed consists in measuring the apparent Doppler temperature of C4+ and protons with high spectral resolution techniques with spatial resolution. The level of turbulent velocities in the plasma has been deduced from the difference observed between the apparent temperature of both species, following a method previously presented and borrowed from astrophysics. The study of this difference, as a function of plasma density and injected power, provides a way to explore if this turbulence plays any role in the confinement of the hot TJ-II plasma.",Human
"A low-dimensional model of large Prandtl-number ($P$) Rayleigh B\'{e}nard convection is constructed using some of the important modes of pseudospectral direct numerical simulations. A detailed bifurcation analysis of the low-dimensional model for $P=6.8$ and aspect ratio of $2\sqrt{2}$ reveals a rich instability and chaos picture: steady rolls, time-periodicity, quasiperiodicity, phase locking, chaos, and crisis. Bifurcation analysis also reveals multiple co-existing attractors, and a window with time-periodicity after chaos. The results of the low-dimensional model matches quite closely with some of the past simulations and experimental results where they observe chaos in RBC through quasiperiodicity and phase locking.",Human
"The arrest of Langmuir-wave collapse by quantum effects, first addressed by Haas and Shukla [Phys. Rev. E 79, 066402 (2009)] using a Rayleigh-Ritz trial-function method is revisited, using rigorous estimates and systematic asymptotic expansions. The absence of blow up for the so-called quantum Zakharov equations is proved in two and three dimensions, whatever the strength of the quantum effects. The time-periodic behavior of the solution for initial conditions slightly in excess of the singularity threshold for the classical problem is established for various settings in two space dimensions. The difficulty of developing a consistent perturbative approach in three dimensions is also discussed, and a semi-phenomenological model is suggested for this case.",Human
"We show that strategy independent adaptations of random interaction networks can induce powerful mechanisms, ranging from the Red Queen to group selection, that promote cooperation in evolutionary social dilemmas. These two mechanisms emerge spontaneously as dynamical processes due to deletions and additions of links, which are performed whenever players adopt new strategies and after a certain number of game iterations, respectively. The potency of cooperation promotion, as well as the mechanism responsible for it, can thereby be tuned via a single parameter determining the frequency of link additions. We thus demonstrate that coevolving random networks may evoke an appropriate mechanism for each social dilemma, such that cooperation prevails even by highly unfavorable conditions.",Human
"We study the agility of current-tunable oscillators based on a magnetic vortex orbiting around a point contact in spin-valves. Theory predicts frequency-tuning by currents occurs at constant orbital radius, so an exceptional agility is anticipated. To test this, we have inserted an oscillator in a microwave interferometer to apply abrupt current variations while time resolving its emission. Using frequency shift keying, we show that the oscillator can switch between two stabilized frequencies differing by 25% in less than ten periods. With a wide frequency tunability and a good agility, such oscillators possess desirable figures of merit for modulation-based rf applications.",Human
"Within the context of agent-based Monte-Carlo simulations, we study the well-known majority-vote model (MVM) with noise applied to tax evasion on simple square lattices, Voronoi-Delaunay random lattices, Barabasi-Albert networks, and Erd\""os-R\'enyi random graphs. In the order to analyse and to control the fluctuations for tax evasion in the economics model proposed by Zaklan, MVM is applied in the neighborhod of the noise critical $q_{c}$. The Zaklan model had been studied recently using the equilibrium Ising model. Here we show that the Zaklan model is robust and can be reproduced also through the nonequilibrium MVM on various topologies.",Human
"In this paper, the author brings further details regarding his Lightning Ball observation that were not mentioned in the first one (Ref.1-2). Additionally, he goes more into detail as the three forces that are necessary to allow the residual crescent form the hydrodynamic vortex ring to shrink into a sphere.Further topics are the similarities and analogies between the Lightning Ball formation's theory and the presently undertaken Tokamak-Stellarator-Spheromak fusion reactor experiments. A new theory and its experimental realisation are proposed as to make the shrinking of the hot plasma of reactors into a ball possible by means of the so called long range electromagnetic forces. In this way,the fusion ignition temperature could possibly atteined.",Human
"Transient state of femtosecond laser excited bismuth has been studied by various groups with time-resolved optical, x-ray, and electron probes at the deposited energy density from below through up to several times the equilibrium enthalpy of melting. However, the interpretations of the experimental results are controversial: the optical probes reveal the absence of transition to the melting phase while the authors of x-ray and electron diffraction experiments claim the observation of ultrafast non-thermal melting. The presented analysis, based on temperature dependence of bismuth optical properties, unequivocally shows a purely thermal nature of all the observed fs-laser induced transformations in bismuth.",Human
We describe an ultra-sensitive atomic magnetometer using optically-pumped potassium atoms operating in spin-exchange relaxation free (SERF) regime. We demonstrate magnetic field sensitivity of 160 aT/Hz$^{1/2}$ in a gradiometer arrangement with a measurement volume of 0.45 cm$^3$ and energy resolution per unit time of $44 \hbar$. As an example of a new application enabled by such a magnetometer we describe measurements of weak remnant rock magnetization as a function of temperature with a sensitivity on the order of 10$^{-10}$ emu/cm$^3$/Hz$^{1/2}$ and temperatures up to 420$^\circ$C.,Human
"By using Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and Semiclassical Quantization, one may argue that the low-lying excited states of any quantum system can be modeled by a set of harmonic oscillators. In the present paper, we fit the experimental excitation spectra of atoms with atomic number 2< Z< 36 to a simple harmonic oscillator model with two parameters: the number of degrees of freedom, d, and the effective frequency, \omega. The obtained \hbar\omega takes values around 0.03 (in atomic units), whereas d shows clear shell filling effects, that is, takes high values for the noble gases, suggesting collective oscillations of the electrons occupying the last shell.",Human
We investigate frequency up-conversion of low power cw resonant radiation in Rb vapour as a function of various experimental parameters. We present evidence that the process of four wave mixing is responsible for unidirectional blue light generation and that the phase matching conditions along a light-induced waveguide determine the direction and divergence of the blue light. Velocity-selective excitation to the 5D level via step-wise and two-photon processes results in a Doppler-free dependence on the frequency detuning of the applied laser fields from the respective dipole-allowed transitions. Possible schemes for ultraviolet generation are discussed.,Human
"We present the theory of radiative association of atoms and molecules, and we apply it to the (H$_2$-H$^-$) van der Waals complex. We discuss the possibility for the H$_3^-$ ion to be formed in the interstellar medium in an environment with abundant ionized molecular hydrogen H$_2^+$. The observation of H$_3^-$ would also be a probe for the presence of H$^-$ in the interstellar medium. By computing the electronic structure of the H$_3^-$ ion, we determine its dipole moment, bound states, rotational constants, predissociated vibrational resonances and their lifetimes, and suggest a way to detect the ion in the interstellar medium.",Human
"We store and control ultra-cold atoms in a new type of trap using magnetic fields of vortices in a high temperature superconducting micro-structure. This is the first time ultra-cold atoms have been trapped in the field of magnetic flux quanta. We generate the attractive trapping potential for the atoms by combining the magnetic field of a superconductor in the remanent state with external homogeneous magnetic fields. We show the control of crucial atom trap characteristics such as an efficient intrinsic loading mechanism, spatial positioning of the trapped atoms and the vortex density in the superconductor. The measured trap characteristics are in good agreement with our numerical simulations.",Human
"The CMS silicon tracker, consisting of 1440 silicon pixel and 15148 silicon strip detector modules, has been aligned using more than three million cosmic ray charged particles, with additional information from optical surveys. The positions of the modules were determined with respect to cosmic ray trajectories to a precision of 3-4 microns RMS in the barrel and 3-14 microns RMS in the endcap in the most sensitive coordinate. The results have been validated by several methods, including the laser alignment system, and compared with predictions obtained from simulation. Correlated systematic effects have been investigated. The track parameter resolutions obtained with this alignment are close to the design performance.",Human
"We applied our previously developed library-based Monte Carlo (LBMC) to equilibrium sampling of several implicitly solvated all-atom peptides. LBMC can perform equilibrium sampling of molecules using the pre-calculated statistical libraries of molecular-fragment configurations and energies. For this study, we employed residue-based fragments distributed according to the Boltzmann factor of the OPLS-AA forcefield describing the individual fragments. Two solvent models were employed: a simple uniform dielectric and the Generalized Born/Surface Area (GBSA) model. The efficiency of LBMC was compared to standard Langevin dynamics (LD) using three different statistical tools. The statistical analyses indicate that LBMC is more than 100 times faster than LD not only for the simple solvent model but also for GBSA.",Human
"Many physical and chemical processes, such as folding of biopolymers, are best described as dynamics on large combinatorial energy landscapes. A concise approximate description of dynamics is obtained by partitioning the micro-states of the landscape into macro-states. Since most landscapes of interest are not tractable analytically, the probabilities of transitions between macro-states need to be extracted numerically from the microscopic ones, typically by full enumeration of the state space. Here we propose to approximate transition probabilities by a Markov chain Monte-Carlo method. For landscapes of the number partitioning problem and an RNA switch molecule we show that the method allows for accurate probability estimates with significantly reduced computational cost.",Human
"This article describes the fluid dynamics video, ""A Numerical Simulation of a Plunging Breaking Wave"", which was submitted to the gallery of fluid motion at the 2009 APS/DFD conference. The simulation was of a deep-water plunging breaking wave. It was a two-phase calculation which used a Volume of Fluid (VOF) method to simulate the interface between the two immiscible fluids. Surface tension and viscous effects were not considered. The initial wave was generated by applying a spatio-temporal pressure forcing on the free surface. The video shows the 50% isocontour of the volume fraction from several different perspectives. Significant air entrainment is observed as well as the presence of stream-wise vortex structures.",Human
"A digital hadronic calorimeter using MICROMEGAS as active elements is a very promising choice for particle physics experiments at future lepton colliders. These experiments will be optimized for application of the particle flow algorithm and therefore require calorimeters with very fine lateral segmentation. A 1 m2 prototype based on MICROMEGAS chambers with 1x1 cm2 readout pads is currently being developed at LAPP. The GEANT4 simulation of the physics performance of a MICROMEGAS calorimeter is presented. The main characteristics, such as energy resolution, linearity and shower profile, have been carefully examined for various passive materials with pions over a wide energy range from 3 to 200 GeV. The emphasis is put on the comparison of the analog and digital readout.",Human
"We present a novel approach to calculating strong field ionization dynamics of multielectron molecular targets. Adopting a multielectron wavefunction ansatz based on field-free ab initio neutral and ionic multielectron states, a set of coupled time-dependent single-particle Schroedinger equations describing the neutral amplitude and continuum electron are constructed. These equations, amenable to direct numerical solution or further analytical treatment, allow one to study multielectron effects during strong field ionization, recollision, and high harmonic generation. We apply the method to strong field ionization of CO_2, and suggest the importance of intermediate core excitation to explain previous failure of analytical models to reproduce experimental ionization yields for this molecule.",Human
"ArgoNeuT (Argon Neutrino Test), a NSF/DOE project at Fermilab, is the first LArTPC to go in a low energy neutrino beam and just the second LArTPC to go in a neutrino beam ever. ArgoNeuT sits just upstream of the on-axis MINOS near detector in the NuMI beamline, about 1 km from the target station and 100 m underground. The detector features a 47X40X90 cm (169 L) active volume TPC with a fully contained recirculation and purification system. Among other physics, ArgoNeuT will measure the charged-current quasi-elastic (anti-) neutrino cross section on argon at an energy of ~3 GeV.",Human
"The ATLAS muon spectrometer consists of several major components: Monitored Drift Tubes (MDTs) for precision measurements in the bending plane of the muons, supplemented by Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) in the high eta region; Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) and Thin Gap Chambers (TGCs) for trigger and second coordinate measurement in the barrel and endcap regions, respectively; an optical alignment system to track the relative positions of all chambers; and, finally, the world's largest air-core magnetic toroid system. We will describe the status and commissioning of the muon system with cosmic rays and plans for commissioning with early beams.",Human
"Faraday waves are generated at the air/liquid interface inside an array of square cells. As the free surface inside each cell is destabilizing due to the oscillations, the shape of the free surface is drastically changing. Depending on the value of the frequency f of oscillations, different patterns are observed inside each cell. For well defined f values, neighboring cells are observed to interact and a general organization is noticed. In such a situation, initially disordered structures lead to a general pattern covering the entire liquid pool and a spatial order appears all over the cell array. This abstract is related to a fluid dynamics video for the gallery of fluid motion 2009.",Human
"We present modified $\ell$-states of diatomic molecules by solving the radial and angle-dependent parts of the Schr\""odinger equation for central potentials, such as Morse and Kratzer, plus an exactly solvable angle-dependent potential $V_{\theta}(\theta)/r^2$ within the framework of the Nikiforov-Uvarov (NU) method. We emphasize that the contribution which comes from the solution of the Schr\""odinger equation for the angle-dependent potential modifies the usual angular momentum quantum number $\ell$. We calculate explicitly bound state energies of a number of neutral diatomic molecules composed of a first-row transition metal and main-group elements for both Morse and Kratzer potentials plus an angle-dependent potential.",Human
"In our continuous variable quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme, the homodyne detection set-up requires balancing the intensity of an incident beam between two photodiodes. Realistic lens systems are insufficient to provide a spatially stable focus in the presence of large spatial beam-jitter caused by atmospheric transmission. We therefore present an improved geometry for optical tapers which offer up to four times the angular tolerance of a lens. The effective area of a photodiode can thus be increased, without decreasing its bandwidth. This makes them suitable for use in our free space QKD experiment and in free space optical communication in general.",Human
"Drop deformation in uniform electric fields is a classic problem. The pioneering work of G.I.Taylor demonstrated that for weakly conducting media, the drop fluid undergoes a toroidal flow and the drop adopts a prolate or oblate spheroidal shape, the flow and shape being axisymmetrically aligned with the applied field. However, recent studies have revealed a nonaxisymmetric rotational mode for drops of lower conductivity than the surrounding medium, similar to the rotation of solid dielectric particles observed by Quincke in the 19th century. This fluid dynamics video demonstrates three behavioral modes. I) toroidal recirculation inside the drop in weak fields II) nonaxisymmetric fluid rotation in strong fields and III) drop breakup in strong fields.",Human
"Here we show a folding-stretching instability in a microfluidic flow focusing device using silicon oil (100cSt) and water. The fluid dynamics video demonstrates an oscillating thread of oil focused by two co-flowing streams of water. We show several high-speed sequences of these oscillations with 30,000 frames/s. Once the thread is decelerated in a slower moving pool downstream an instability sets in and water-in-oil droplets are formed. We reveal the details of the pinch-off with 500,000 frames/s. The pinch-off is so repeatable that complex droplet patterns emerge. Some of droplets are below the resolution limit, thus smaller than 1 micrometer in diameter.",Human
The video shows the flow dynamics within inner and outer regions of a vortex core. The observed phenomena mimic a transport process occurring within the Antarctic vortex. The video shows two distinct regions: a strongly mixed core and broad ring of weakly mixed region extending out the vortex core boundaries. The two regions are separated by a thin layer that isolates the weakly and strongly mixed regions; this thin layer behaves as barrier to the mixing of the two regions. The video shows that the barriers deplete when a swirl of the vortex core increases and the vortex core espouses a triangular pattern.,Human
"When micrometric drops coalesce in-plane on a superhydrophobic surface, a surprising out-of-plane jumping motion was observed. Such jumping motion triggered by drop coalescence was reproduced on a Leidenfrost surface. High-speed imaging revealed that this jumping motion results from the elastic interaction of the bridged drops with the superhydrophobic/Leidenfrost surface. Experiments on both the superhydrophobic and Leidenfrost surfaces compare favorably to a simple scaling model relating the kinetic energy of the merged drop to the surface energy released upon coalescence. The spontaneous jumping motion on water repellent surfaces enables the autonomous removal of water condensate independently of gravity; this process is highly desirable for sustained dropwise condensation.",Human
"Oppositely charged drops have long been assumed to experience an attractive force that favors their coalescence. In this fluid dynamics video we demonstrate the existence of a critical field strength above which oppositely charged drops do not coalesce. We observe that appropriately positioned and oppositely charged drops migrate towards one another in an applied electric field; but whereas the drops coalesce as expected at low field strengths, they are repelled from one another after contact at higher field strengths. Qualitatively, the drops appear to `bounce' off one another. We directly image the transient formation of a meniscus bridge between the bouncing drops.",Human
"A concept of the total velocity that contains velocity and oscillatory velocity is proposed for the velocity solution of Dirac equation. It is shown that the electronic rest energy all comes from the oscillation of the electron itself. For this reason, the velocity solution of Dirac equation is taken as the definition of elementary particles. Leptons, mesons and baryons appear in results as the newly defined elementary particles, but the particle that consists of more than three quarks is ruled out. The results also show that a quark is not a particle, but part of the hadron or a partial particle and that quark confinement may serve as an evidence of this conclusion.",Human
"We investigate the dripping of liquids around solid surfaces in the regime of inertial flows, a situation commonly encountered with the so-called ""teapot effect"". We demonstrate that surface wettability is an unexpected key factor in controlling flow separation and dripping, the latter being completely suppressed in the limit of superhydrophobic substrates. This unforeseen coupling is rationalized in terms of a novel hydro-capillary adhesion framework, which couples inertial flows to surface wettability effects. This description of flow separation successfully captures the observed dependence on the various experimental parameters - wettability, flow velocity, solid surface edge curvature-. As a further illustration of this coupling, a real-time control of dripping is demonstrated using electro-wetting for contact angle actuation.",Human
"We present a method for computing optical absorption spectra by means of a Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, which is based on a conserving linear response calculation for electron-hole coherences in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. This procedure allows, in principle, for the determination of the electron-hole correlation function self-consistently with the corresponding single-particle Green function. We analyze the general approach for a ""one-shot"" calculation of the photoabsorption cross section of finite systems, and discuss the importance of scattering and dephasing contributions in this approach. We apply the method to the closed-shell clusters Na_4, Na^+_9 and Na^+_(21), treating one active electron per Na atom.",Human
"Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber detectors are ideally suited for studying neutrino interactions and probing the parameters that characterize neutrino oscillations. The ability to drift ionization particles over long distances in purified argon and to trigger on abundant scintillation light allows for excellent particle identification and triggering capability. In these proceedings the details of the ArgoNeuT test-beam project will be presented after a brief introduction to the detector technique. ArgoNeuT is a 175 liter detector exposed to Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beamline. The first neutrino interactions observed in ArgoNeuT will be presented, along with discussion of the various physics analyses to be performed on this data sample.",Human
"Suspensions of self-propelled particles, such as swimming micro-organisms, are known to undergo complex dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic interactions. This fluid dynamics video presents a numerical simulation of such a suspension, based on a kinetic theory recently developed by Saintillan and Shelley (Physics of Fluids, 20, 123403, 2008). Starting from a nearly uniform and isotropic initial distribution, our simulations show the formation of strong density fluctuations, which merge and break up in time in a quasiperiodic fashion. These fluctuations are found to occur on the size of the simulation box, in agreement with a prediction from a linear stability analysis. In addition, the dynamics are characterized by complex chaotic flow fields, which result in efficient fluid mixing.",Human
"Our calculations have shown that the 5f_5/2-7s_1/2 23131 cm^{-1} transition from the ground state in the ion Th^{3+} is very sensitive to the temporal variation of the fine structure constant alpha (q=-75300 cm^{-1}). The line is very narrow, the ion has been trapped and laser cooled and the positive shifter line 5f_5/2-5f_7/2 4325 cm^{-1} (q=+2900 cm^{-1}) may be used as a reference. A comparison may also be made with a positive shifter in another atom or ion. This makes Th^{3+} a good candidate to search for the alpha variation.",Human
"Most news recommender systems try to identify users' interests and news' attributes and use them to obtain recommendations. Here we propose an adaptive model which combines similarities in users' rating patterns with epidemic-like spreading of news on an evolving network. We study the model by computer agent-based simulations, measure its performance and discuss its robustness against bias and malicious behavior. Subject to the approval fraction of news recommended, the proposed model outperforms the widely adopted recommendation of news according to their absolute or relative popularity. This model provides a general social mechanism for recommender systems and may find its applications also in other types of recommendation.",Human
"Locomotion and generation of flow at low Reynolds number are subject to severe limitations due to the irrelevance of inertia: the ""scallop theorem"" requires that the system have at least two degrees of freedom, which move in non-reciprocal fashion, i.e. breaking time-reversal symmetry. We show here that a minimal model consisting of just two spheres driven by harmonic potentials is capable of generating flow. In this pump system the two degrees of freedom are the mean and relative positions of the two spheres. We have performed and compared analytical predictions, numerical simulation and experiments, showing that a time-reversible drive is sufficient to induce flow.",Human
"We introduce a new scheme for generating short-wavelength coherent broadband radiation with well-controlled spectral characteristics. It is based on shaping long-wavelength femtosecond pulse to coherently control atomic resonance-mediated (2+1) three-photon excitation to a broad far-from-resonance continuum. Here, the spectrum (central frequency and bandwidth) of deep-ultraviolet coherent broadband radiation generated in Na vapor is experimentally controlled by tuning the linear chirp we apply to the driving phase-shaped near-infrared femtosecond pulse. This is a first step in implementing the full scheme for producing shaped femtosecond pulses at wavelengths down-to the vacuum-ultraviolet range.",Human
"Coherence relaxation in Na vapor was studied utilizing a pump-probe method with femtosecond pulses. The coherence was created by the pump pulse, which excited the Na atoms to the 4S state. The atoms were further excited to the 7P state by the probe pulse. As a result a coherent UV radiation was emitted by the atoms. This emission was used to study the relaxation of both the 4S-3S and 7P-3S coherent superpositions. The relaxation is mainly due to collisions with the Ar atoms serving as a buffer gas. Coherence relaxation times and collisional cross-sections for the Na-Ar collision pairs were extracted experimentally.",Human
"We present and implement a new scheme for independent control of both the final and the transient population utilizing the symmetry properties of the system. By proper pulse shaping, utilizing the invariance of the two-photon absorption to specific phase transformations of the pulse, different time evolutions of the transient population are photo-induced for a given (fixed) final state population. The model system is the Na atom. The work is conducted in the weak-field regime for which the transient two-photon excitation is described by second-order perturbation theory. One most attractive case is the extended family of third-order chirp pulses which control the population build-up duration independently of the final population.",Human
"We report on the development of n-on-p, 3D Double-Side Double Type Column (3D-DDTC) pixel detectors fabricated at FBK-irst (Trento, Italy) and oriented to the ATLAS upgrade. The considered fabrication technology is simpler than that required for full 3D detectors with active edge, but the detector efficiency and radiation hardness critically depend on the columnar electrode overlap and should be carefully evaluated. The first assemblies of these sensors (featuring 2, 3, or 4 columns per pixel) with the ATLAS FEI3 read-out chip have been tested in laboratory. Selected results from the electrical and functional characterization with radioactive sources are here discussed.",Human
"Leaky radiation microscopy (LRM) is used to directly image the surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE). When compared with the prism based set-up commonly used in SPCE research, LRM has the advantages of directly giving out the emitting angle without scanning and the image of generated surface plasmons polaritons (SPPs) propagation, which help to understand the optical process of SPCE. LRM also can give out clearer SPCE image than that by prism-based set-up. Based on the LRM, we find that the SPCE pattern and propagation of SPPs can be modified by the shape of samples fabricated on the thin metallic films.",Human
"Extrasolar planets are not named and are referred to only by their assigned scientific designation. The reason given by the IAU to not name the planets is that it is considered impractical as planets are expected to be common. I advance some reasons as to why this logic is flawed, and suggest names for the 403 extrasolar planet candidates known as of Oct 2009. The names follow a scheme of association with the constellation that the host star pertains to, and therefore are mostly drawn from Roman-Greek mythology. Other mythologies may also be used given that a suitable association is established.",Human
"The accuracy of the energy landscape of silicon systems obtained from various density functional methods, a tight binding scheme and force fields is studied. Quantum Monte Carlo results serve as quasi exact reference values. In addition to the well known accuracy of DFT methods for geometric ground states and metastable configurations we find that DFT methods give a similar accuracy for transition states and thus a good overall description of the energy landscape. On the other hand, force fields give a very poor description of the landscape that are in most cases too rugged and contain many fake local minima and saddle points or ones that have the wrong height.",Human
"Measurement results for a meandered planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) loaded with magneto-dielectric and dielectric materials are presented. Figures of merit and ways to compare antennas with different fillings materials are discussed. The used magneto-dielectric material is described, the radiation mechanism of the meandered PIFA is studied, and the proper position for dielectric and magneto-dielectric filling is discussed and identified. Identical-size antennas with dielectric and magneto-dielectric fillings are compared at the same resonance frequency using the radiation quality factor as the figure of merit. It is seen, that the benefit from the magneto-dielectric filling material is moderate and strongly dependent on the positioning of the filling.",Human
"In recent years, by theory and observation cosmology has advanced substantially. Parameters of the concordance or $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model are given with unprecedented precision (""precision cosmology""). On the other side, 95% of the matter content of the universe are of an unknown nature. This awkward situation motivates the present attempt to find cosmology's place among the (exact) natural sciences. Due to its epistemic and methodical particularities, e.g., as a mathematized historical science, cosmology occupies a very special place. After going through some of the highlights of cosmological modeling, the conclusion is reached that knowledge provided by cosmological modeling cannot be as explicative and secure as knowledge gained by laboratory physics.",Human
"Total cross sections for single ionization and excitation of molecular hydrogen by antiproton impact are presented over a wide range of impact energy from 1 keV to 6.5 MeV. A nonpertubative time-dependent close-coupling method is applied to fully treat the correlated dynamics of the electrons. Good agreement is obtained between the present calculations and experimental measurements of single-ionization cross sections at high energies, whereas some discrepancies with the experiment are found around the maximum. The importance of the molecular geometry and a full two-electron description is demonstrated. The present findings provide benchmark results which might be useful for the development of molecular models.",Human
"The loop structure plays an important role in many aspects of complex networks and attracts much attention. Among the previous works, Bianconi et al find that real networks often have fewer short loops as compared to random models. In this paper, we focus on the uneven location of loops which makes some parts of the network rich while some other parts sparse in loops. We propose a node removing process to analyze the unevenness and find rich loop cores can exist in many real networks such as neural networks and food web networks. Finally, an index is presented to quantify the unevenness of loop location in complex networks.",Human
"We introduce a droplet-jumping phenomenon on a superhydrophobic surface driven by the resonant AC electrowetting. The resonant electrical actuation enables a droplet to accumulate sufficient surface energy for jumping, and superhydrophobic surface minimizes adhesion and hysteresis effects. They provide the effective energy conversion from the surface energy to the kinetic energy and improve the stability and the reproducibility of the droplet jumping. The controlled droplet jumping made by the resonant AC electrowetting could place another milestone in digital microfluidics by establishing a potential way to realize the three-dimensional droplet manipulation based on the conventional single plate EWOD configurations. This abstract is related to a fluid dynamics video for the gallery of fluid motion 2009.",Human
"We develop a statistical model describing the dynamics of magnetic islands in very large current layers that develop in space plasma. Two parameters characterize the island distribution: the flux contained in the island and the area it encloses. We derive an integro-differential evolution equation for this distribution function, based on rules that govern the small-scale generation of secondary islands, the rates of island growth, and island merging. Our numerical solutions of this equation produce island distributions relevant to the magnetosphere and corona. We also derive and analytically solve a differential equation for large islands that explicitly shows the role merging plays in island growth.",Human
"We study the time-resolved reflectivity spectrum of a switched planar GaAs-AlAs microcavity. Between 5 and 40 ps after the switching (pump) pulse we observe a strong excess probe reflectivity and a change of the frequency of light trapped in the cavity up to 5 linewidths away from the cavity resonance. This frequency change does not adiabatically follow the fast-changing cavity resonance. The frequency change is attributed to an accumulated phase change due to the time-dependent refractive index. An analytical model predicts dynamics in qualitative agreement with the experiments, and points to crucial parameters that control future applications.",Human
"The emergence of districts in nanotechnology represents a new pattern of scientific development. The factors affecting their growth are analysed to understand the drivers of economic development. By analyzing the top 200 nano-districts, Nanotrendchart sheds light on the clusterization process: academic production is seen to be highly concentrated, with fifteen districts representing over half of published articles; Asian districts are clearly growing significantly faster than those elsewhere; and district growth in the domain of engineering and physics is more rapid than in other disciplines. Scientific diversity, actors diversity as well as the degree of openness of the cluster influence their evolution. Highly specialised clusters witness lower growth rates",Human
"The 2-spin Ising model in statistical mechanics and the 2x2 normal form game in game theory are compared. All configurations allowed by the second are recovered by the first when the only concern is about Nash equilibria. But it holds no longer when Pareto optimum condiderations are introduced like in the prisoner's dilemma. This gap can nevertheless be filled by adding a new coupling term to the Ising model, even if that term has up to now no physical meaning. An individual complete bilinear objective function is thus found to be sufficient to reproduce all possible configurations of a 2x2 game. Using this one-to-one mapping, new perspectives for future research in both fields can be envisioned.",Human
"A study on the effects of optical gain nonuniformly distributed in one-dimensional random systems is presented. It is demonstrated numerically that even without gain saturation and mode competition, the spatial nonuniformity of gain can cause dramatic and complicated changes to lasing modes. Lasing modes are decomposed in terms of the quasi modes of the passive system to monitor the changes. As the gain distribution changes gradually from uniform to nonuniform, the amount of mode mixing increases. Furthermore, we investigate new lasing modes created by nonuniform gain distributions. We find that new lasing modes may disappear together with existing lasing modes, thereby causing fluctuations in the local density of lasing states.",Human
"Coulomb law is one of the fundamental laws in Physics. It describes the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two electric charges. Counterintuitively the repulsion force between two equal electric charges in a vacuum, stated by the Coulomb law, turn into the attraction force between the same electric charges when they are placed next to a material with negative permittivity and the distance between them is larger than some critical distance. As a result the equally charged particles ""crystallize"" occupying equilibrium positions. We prove this claim with the method of images for two charged particles placed next to a material with negative permittivity.",Human
"The CMS detector is designed around a large 4 T superconducting solenoid, enclosed in a 12000-tonne steel return yoke. A detailed map of the magnetic field is required for the accurate simulation and reconstruction of physics events in the CMS detector, not only in the inner tracking region inside the solenoid but also in the large and complex structure of the steel yoke, which is instrumented with muon chambers. Using a large sample of cosmic muon events collected by CMS in 2008, the field in the steel of the barrel yoke has been determined with a precision of 3 to 8% depending on the location.",Human
"Single gold nanoparticles can act as nanoantennas for enhancing the fluorescence of emitters in their near-fields. Here we present experimental and theoretical studies of scanning antenna-based fluorescence microscopy as a function of the diameter of the gold nanoparticle. We examine the interplay between fluorescence enhancement and spatial resolution and discuss the requirements for deciphering single molecules in a dense sample. Resolutions better than 20 nm and fluorescence enhancement up to 30 times are demonstrated experimentally. By accounting for the tip shaft and the sample interface in finite-difference time-domain calculations, we explain why the measured fluorescence enhancements are higher in the presence of an interface than the values predicted for a homogeneous environment.",Human
"Different non-equilibrium situations have recently been considered when studying the thermal Casimir--Polder interaction with a body. We show that the Keldysh Green function method provides a very general common framework for such studies where non-equilibrium of either the atom or the body with the environment can be accounted for. We apply the results to the case of ground state polar molecules out of equilibrium with their environment, observing several striking effects. We consider thermal Casimir--Polder potentials in planar configurations, and new results for a molecule in a cylindrical cavity are reported, showing similar characteristic behaviour as found in planar geometry.",Human
We investigate a reaction of boron trichloride (BCl3) with iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3) by ab initio quantum chemical calculation as a simple model for a reaction of iron impurities in BCl3 gas. We also examine a reaction with water. We find that compounds such as Fe(Cl)(OBCl2)2(OHBCl2) and Fe(Cl)2(OBCl2)(OHBCl2) are formed while producing HCl and reaction paths to them are revealed. We also analyze the stabilization mechanism of these paths using newly-developed interaction energy density derived from electronic stress tensor in the framework of the Regional DFT (Density Functional Theory) and Rigged QED (Quantum ElectroDynamics).,Human
"We have studied the correlation effects in Cs and Fr arising from the interplay of the residual Coulomb interaction to all orders and the neutral weak interaction which gives rise to the parity violating electric dipole transition to first order, within the framework of the relativistic coupled-cluster theory which circumvents the constrain of explicitly summing over the intermediate states. We observe that, the contributions arising from the perturbed doubly excited states are quite significant and hence, any calculation should not be considered accurate unless it includes the perturbed double excitations comprehensively. In this article, we have reported a comparative study of various results related to the parity violation in Cs and Fr.",Human
"We utilize various techniques to characterize the residual phase modulation of a fiber-based Mach-Zehnder electro-optical intensity modulator. A heterodyne technique is used to directly measure the phase change due to a given change in intensity, thereby determining the chirp parameter of the device. This chirp parameter is also measured by examining the ratio of sidebands for sinusoidal amplitude modulation. Finally, the frequency chirp caused by an intensity pulse on the nanosecond time scale is measured via the heterodyne signal. We show that this chirp can be largely compensated with a separate phase modulator. The various measurements of the chirp parameter are in reasonable agreement.",Human
"We report on the experimental observation of induced solitons in a passively mode-locked fiber ring laser with birefringence cavity. Due to the cross coupling between the two orthogonal polarization components of the laser, it was found that if a soliton was formed along one cavity polarization axis, a weak soliton was also induced along the orthogonal polarization axis, and depending on the net cavity birefringence, the induced soliton could either have the same or different center wavelengths to that of the inducing soliton. Moreover, the induced soliton always had the same group velocity as that of the inducing soliton. They form a vector soliton in the cavity. Numerical simulations confirmed the experimental observations.",Human
"We adapt a biomechanical argument of Rashevsky, which places limits on the stress experienced by a torso supported by the legs, to deduce that body mass $m$ of growing children should scale as the $p$th power of height $h$ with $7/3<p<8/3$. Further arguments based on stability and heat loss suggest that $p$ should be close to 8/3. The arguments are extended to suggest that waist circumference $w$ should scale as $h^q$ with $q$ near the lower end of $2/3\leq q \leq 1$. Data from Hong Kong and British children are consistent with these hypotheses.",Human
"In a recent Letter Ciftci and Cakmak [EPL 87, 60003 (2009)] showed that the two dimensional random walk in a bounded domain, where walkers which cross the boundary return to a base curve near origin with deterministic rules, can produce regular patterns. Our numerical calculations suggest that the cumulative probability distribution function of the returning walkers along the base curve is a Devil's staircase, which can be explained from the mapping of these walks to a non-linear stochastic map. The non-trivial probability distribution function(PDF) is a universal feature of CCRW characterized by the fractal dimension d=1.75(0) of the PDF bounding curve.",Human
"Frozen parametric disorder can lead to appearance of sets of localized convective currents in an otherwise stable (quiescent) fluid layer heated from below. These currents significantly influence the transport of an admixture (or any other passive scalar) along the layer. When the molecular diffusivity of the admixture is small in comparison to the thermal one, which is quite typical in nature, disorder can enhance the effective (eddy) diffusivity by several orders of magnitude in comparison to the molecular diffusivity. In this paper we study the effect of an imposed longitudinal advection on delocalization of convective currents, both numerically and analytically; and report subsequent drastic boost of the effective diffusivity for weak advection.",Human
"The control of nonlinear processes and possible transitions to chaos in systems of interacting particles is a fundamental physical problem. We propose a new nonuniform solid-state plasma system, produced by the optical injection of current in two-dimensional semiconductor structures, where this control can be achieved. Due to an injected current, the system symmetry is initially broken. The subsequent nonequilibrium dynamics is governed by the spatially varying long-range Coulomb forces and electron-hole collisions. As a result, inhomogeneities in the charge and velocity distributions should develop rapidly, and lead to previously unexpected experimental consequences. We suggest that the system eventually evolves into a behavior similar to chaos.",Human
"We show that the heterogeneity index, which was proposed by Hu and Wang (Physica A 2008 387 3769), can be used to describe the disparity of the cooperation sharing or competition gain distributions that is very important for the cooperation/competition system dynamic understanding. An analytical relation between the distribution parameters and the heterogeneity index is derived, which is in a good agreement with the empirical results. Our theoretical and empirical analyses also show that the relation between the distribution parameters can be analytically derived from so-called Zhang-Chang model (Physica A 2006 360 599 and 2007 383 687). This strongly recommends a possibility to create a general dynamic cooperation/competition model based on Zhang-Chang model.",Human
"A detailed discussion is presented of the Vlasov-Maxwell equilibrium for the force-free Harris sheet recently found by Harrison and Neukirch (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 135003, 2009). The derivation of the distribution function and a discussion of its general properties and their dependence on the distribution function parameters will be given. In particular, the distribution function can be single-peaked or multi-peaked in two of the velocity components, with possible implications for stability. The dependence of the shape of the distribution function on the values of its parameters will be investigated and the relation to macroscopic quantities such as the current sheet thickness will be discussed.",Human
The equilibrium size and temperature limits of thermally and chemically equilibrated $e^+e^-\gamma$ plasma drops are investigated at a given energy content. For a plasma to be equilibrated it must be opaque to electron and photon interactions. The opaqueness condition is determined by comparing plasma size with the mean free electron and photon paths. We calculate those paths using thermal Lorentz-invariant reaction rates for pair production and electron(positron) and photon scattering. The range of the corresponding plasma temperature and size is evaluated numerically. Considering the energy and size we find that the opaque and equilibrated plasma drop may be experimentally attainable.,Human
"In this paper, we consider the vibratory motions of lumped parameter systems wherein the components of the system cannot be described by constitutive expressions for the force in terms of appropriate kinematical quantities. Such physical systems reduce to a system of differential-algebraic equations, which invariably need to be solved numerically. To illustrate the issues with clarity, we consider a simple system in which the dashpot is assumed to contain a ""Bingham"" fluid for which one cannot describe the force in the dashpot as a function of the velocity. On the other hand, one can express the velocity as a function of the force.",Human
"We investigate the dynamics of capillary filling using two lattice Boltzmann schemes: a liquid-gas model and a binary model. The simulation results are compared to the well-known Washburn's law, which predicts that the filled length of the capillary scales with time as $l \propto t^{1/2}$. We find that the liquid-gas model does not reproduce Washburn's law due to condensation of the gas phase at the interface, which causes the asymptotic behaviour of the capillary penetration to be faster than $t^{1/2}. The binary model, on the other hand, captures the correct scaling behaviour when the viscosity ratio between the two phases is sufficiently high.",Human
"Digital holographic microscopy based on Gabor in-line holography is a well-known method to reconstruct both the amplitude and phase of small objects. To reconstruct the image of an object from its hologram, obtained under illumination by monochromatic scalar waves, numerical calculations of Fresnel integrals are required. To improve spatial resolution in the resulting reconstruction, we re-sample the holographic data before application of the reconstruction algorithm. This procedure amounts to inverting an interpolated Fresnel diffraction image to recover the object. The advantage of this method is demonstrated on experimental data, for the case of visible-light Gabor holography of a resolution grid and a gnat wing.",Human
"I analyze a scheme that is capable of producing large Kerr nonlinearities on cavity-atom polaritons in a cavity QED system consisting of multiple three-level atoms confined in a cavity mode. A weak control laser coupled to the atoms from free space induces destructive quantum interference in the polariton excitation of the coupled cavity-atom system and creates large Kerr nonlinearities on the intra-cavity light field. The scheme can be used for optical switching or cross-phase modulation of the cavity-atom polariton at ultra-low light levels, which may be useful for applications in quantum state manipulation in cavity QED, quantum measurements, and quantum logic gates.",Human
"Beams of neutral polar molecules in a low-field seeking quantum state can be slowed down using a Stark decelerator, and can subsequently be loaded and confined in electrostatic quadrupole traps. The efficiency of the trap loading process is determined by the ability to couple the decelerated packet of molecules into the trap without loss of molecules and without heating. We discuss the inherent difficulties to obtain ideal trap loading, and describe and compare different trap loading strategies. A new ""split-endcap"" quadrupole trap design is presented that enables improved trap loading efficiencies. This is experimentally verified by comparing the trapping of OH radicals using the conventional and the new quadrupole trap designs.",Human
"In a recent paper, Wicht, L\""ammerzahl, Lorek, and Dittus [Phys. Rev. {\bf A 78}, 013610 (2008)] come to the conclusion that a molecular rotational-vibrational quantum interferometer may possess the sensitivity necessary to detect gravitational waves. We do not agree with their results and demonstrate here that the true sensitivity of such interferometer is many orders of magnitude worse than that claimed in the mentioned paper. In the present comment we estimate the expected energy shifts and derive equations of motion for a quantum symmetric top (diatomic molecule or deformed nucleus) in the field of gravitational wave, and then estimate the sensitivity of possible experiments.",Human
"We investigate the community structure of physics subfields in the citation network of all Physical Review publications between 1893 and August 2007. We focus on well-cited publications (those receiving more than 100 citations), and apply modularity maximization to uncover major communities that correspond to clearly-identifiable subfields of physics. While most of the links between communities connect those with obvious intellectual overlap, there sometimes exist unexpected connections between disparate fields due to the development of a widely-applicable theoretical technique or by cross fertilization between theory and experiment. We also examine communities decade by decade and also uncover a small number of significant links between communities that are widely separated in time.",Human
"We consider the influence of the electron spin on the nonlinear propagation of whistler waves. For this purpose a recently developed electron two-fluid model, where the spin up- and down populations are treated as different fluids, is adapted to the electron MHD regime. We then derive a nonlinear Schrodinger equation for whistler waves, and compare the coefficients of nonlinearity with and without spin effects. The relative importance of spin effects depend on the plasma density and temperature as well as the external magnetic field strength and the wave frequency. The significance of our results to various plasmas are discussed.",Human
"We demonstrate highly efficient generation of coherent 420nm light via up-conversion of near-infrared lasers in a hot rubidium vapor cell. By optimizing pump polarizations and frequencies we achieve a single-pass conversion efficiency of 260% per Watt, significantly higher than in previous experiments. A full exploration of the coherent light generation and fluorescence as a function of both pump frequencies reveals that coherent blue light is generated close to 85Rb two-photon resonances, as predicted by theory, but at high vapor pressure is suppressed in spectral regions that do not support phase matching or exhibit single-photon Kerr refraction. Favorable scaling of our current 1mW blue beam power with additional pump power is predicted.",Human
"A new analytic expression is derived for the resonant drive of high n Alfvenic modes by particles accelerated to high energy by Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating. This derivation includes finite orbit effects, and the formalism is completely non-perturbative. The high-n limit is used to calculate the complex particle response integrals along the orbits explicitly. This new theory is applied to downward sweeping Alfven Cascade quasimodes completing the theory of these modes, and making testable predictions. These predictions are found to be consistent with experiments carried out on the Joint European Torus [P. H. Rebut and B. E. Keen, Fusion Technol. 11, 13 (1987)].",Human
"In this work we suggest a simplified ""quasi-classical"" formalism of the Schwarzschild black hole thermodynamics. We define such small quantum system at Schwarzschild black hole horizon surface whose reduced Compton wavelength equals one circumference of a great circle on the black hole horizon surface. (It is in some way similar to the Bohr orbital momentum quantization postulate for the ground state interpreted via de Broglie relation.) It admits very simple functional connections between all black hole basic thermodynamic characteristics (Unruh temperature, Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Bekenstein entropy horizon surface quantization, evaporation time) and small quantum system mass. All this can be very interesting for the quantum gravity specialists as well as non-specialists.",Human
"Bonacich centrality measures the number of attenuated paths between nodes in a network. We use this metric to study network structure, specifically, to rank nodes and find community structure of the network. To this end we extend the modularity-maximization method for community detection to use this centrality metric as a measure of node connectivity. Bonacich centrality contains a tunable parameter that sets the length scale of interactions. By studying how rankings and discovered communities change when this parameter is varied allows us to identify globally important nodes and structures. We apply the proposed method to several benchmark networks and show that it leads to better insight into network structure than earlier methods.",Human
"After reviewing the problematic behavior of some previously suggested finite interval spatial operators of the symmetric Riesz type, we create a wish list leading toward a new spatial operator suitable to use in the space-time fractional differential equation of anomalous diffusion when the transport of material is strictly restricted to a bounded domain. Based on recent studies of wall effects, we introduce a new definition of the spatial operator and illustrate its favorable characteristics. We provide two numerical methods to solve the modified space-time fractional differential equation and show particular results illustrating compliance to our established list of requirements, most important to the conservation principle and the second law of thermodynamics.",Human
"This research analyzes a ""who cites whom"" matrix in terms of aggregated, journal-journal citations to determine the location of communication studies on the academic spectrum. Using the Journal of Communication as the seed journal, the 2006 data in the Journal Citation Reports are used to map communication studies. The results show that social and experimental psychology journals are the most frequently used sources of information in this field. In addition, several journals devoted to the use and effects of media and advertising are weakly integrated into the larger communication research community, whereas communication studies are dominated by American journals.",Human
"Observed physical phenomena can be described well by quantum mechanics or general relativity. People may try to find an unified fundamental theory which mainly aims to merge gravity with quantum theory. However, difficulty in merging those theories self-consistently still exists, and no such theory is generally accepted. Here we try to propose a quantum theory with space and time in symmetrical positions in the framework of general relativity. In this theory, Dirac matter fields, gauge fields and gravity field are formulated in an unified way which satisf Dirac equation, Yang-Mills equation and Einstein equation in operator form. This combines the quantum mechanics and general relativity .",Human
"We describe a method for controlling many-body states in extended ensembles of Rydberg atoms, forming crystalline structures during laser excitation of a frozen atomic gas. Specifically, we predict the existence of an excitation number staircase in laser excitation of atomic ensembles into Rydberg states. Each step corresponds to a crystalline state with a well-defined of regularly spaced Rydberg atoms. We show that such states can be selectively excited by chirped laser pulses. Finally, we demonstarte that, sing quantum state transfer from atoms to light, such crystals can be used to create crystalline photonic states and can be probed via photon correlation measurements.",Human
"The journal set which provides a representation of nanoscience and nanotechnology at the interfaces among applied physics, chemistry, and the life sciences is developing rapidly because of the introduction of new journals. The relevant contributions of nations can be expected to change according to the representations of the relevant interfaces among journal sets. In the 2005 set the position of the USA decreased more than in the 2004-set, while the EU-27 gained in terms of its percentage of world share of citations. The tag ""Y01N"" which was newly added to the EU classification system for patents, allows for the visualization of national profiles of nanotechnology in terms of relevant patents and patent classes.",Human
"The present work studies the isotropic and homogeneous turbulence for incompressible fluids through a specific Lyapunov analysis, assuming that the turbulence is due to the bifurcations associated to the velocity field. The analysis consists in the calculation of the velocity fluctuation through the Lyapunov analysis of the local deformation and the Navier-Stokes equations and in the study of the mechanism of the energy cascade from large to small scales through the finite scale Lyapunov analysis of the relative motion between two particles. The analysis provides an explanation for the mechanism of the energy cascade, leads to the closure of the von Karman-Howarth equation, and describes the statistics of the velocity difference. Several tests and numerical results are presented.",Human
"The localization (confinement) of coupled plasmon modes, named as gradons, has been studied in metal nanoparticle chains immersed in a graded dielectric host. We exploited the time evolution of various initial wavepackets formed by the linear combination of the coupled modes. We found an important interplay between the localization of plasmonic gradons and the oscillation in such graded plasmonic chains. Unlike in optical superlattices, gradient cannot always lead to Bloch oscillations, which can only occur for wavepackets consisting of particular types of gradons. Moreover, the wavepackets will undergo different forms of oscillations. The correspondence can be applied to design a variety of optical devices by steering among various oscillations.",Human
"Microtubules are filament-shaped, polymeric proteins (~25 nm in diameter) involved in cellular structure and organization. We demonstrate the imaging of individual microtubules using a conventional bright-field microscope, without any additional phase or polarization optics. Light scattered by microtubules is discriminated through extensive use of digital image-processing, thus removing background, reducing noise and enhancing contrast. The setup builds on a commercial microscope, with the inclusion of a minimal and inexpensive set of components, suitable for implementation in the student laboratory. We show how this technique can be applied to a demonstrative biophysical assay, by tracking the motions of microtubules driven by the motor protein kinesin.",Human
"We present the uncertainty discussion of a recent experiment performed at the GSI storage ring ESR for the accurate energy measurement of the He-like uranium 1s2p3P2- 1s2s3S1 intra-shell transition. For this propose we used a Johann-type Bragg spectrometer that enables to obtain a relative energy measurement between the He-like uranium transition, about 4.51 keV, and a calibration x-ray source. As reference, we used the Ka fluorescence lines of zinc and the Li-like uranium 1s22p2P3/2 - 1 s22s 2S1/2 intra-shell transition from fast ions stored in the ESR. A comparison of the two different references, i.e., stationary and moving x-ray source, and a discussion of the experimental uncertainties is presented.",Human
"Particles floating on the surface of a turbulent incompressible fluid accumulate along string-like structures, while leaving large regions of the flow domain empty. This is reflected experimentally by a very peaked probability distribution function of $c_r$, the coarse-grained particle concentration at scale $r$, around $c_r = 0$, with a power-law decay over two decades of $c_r$, $\Pi (c_r) \propto c_r^{-\beta_r}$. The positive exponent $\beta_r$ decreases with scale in the inertial range, and stays approximately constant in the dissipative range, thus indicating a qualitative difference between the dissipative and the inertial ranges of scales, also visible in the first moment of $c_r$.",Human
"In this paper we construct and analyse strongly connected sparse directed networks with an enhanced propensity for synchronization (PFS). Two types of PFS-enhanced networks are considered: (i) an eigenratio minimizing ensemble with non-vanishing complex parts of the spectrum and (ii) a class of networks with real spectrum but slightly larger eigenratios than (i). We relate the superior PFSs to a strongly skewed out-degree distribution, the density of double links and a hierarchical periphery-core organization. Ensembles (i) and (ii) are found to differ in the density of double links and the particular organization of the core and the periphery-core linkage.",Human
"Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly-connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows one to study community structure in a very general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales.",Human
"We study the influence of polarization effects in streaking by combined atto- and femtosecond pulses. The polarization-induced terms alter the streaking spectrum. The normal streaking spectrum, which maps to the vector potential of the femtosecond pulse, is modified by a contribution following the field instead. We show that polarization effects may lead to an apparent temporal shift, that needs to be properly accounted for in the analysis. The effect may be isolated and studied by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy from oriented polar molecules. We also show that polarization effects will lead to an apparent temporal shift of 50 as between photoelectrons from a 2p and 1s state in atomic hydrogen.",Human
"We consider deflection of polarizable molecules by inhomogeneous optical fields, and analyze the role of molecular orientation and rotation in the scattering process. It is shown that molecular rotation induces spectacular rainbow-like features in the distribution of the scattering angle. Moreover, by pre-shaping molecular angular distribution with the help of short and strong femtosecond laser pulses, one may efficiently control the scattering process, manipulate the average deflection angle and its distribution, and reduce substantially the angular dispersion of the deflected molecules. This opens new ways for many applications involving molecular focusing, guiding and trapping by optical and static fields.",Human
"We report on the observation of an elementary exchange process in an optically trapped ultracold sample of atoms and Feshbach molecules. We can magnetically control the energetic nature of the process and tune it from endoergic to exoergic, enabling the observation of a pronounced threshold behavior. In contrast to relaxation to more deeply bound molecular states, the exchange process does not lead to trap loss. We find excellent agreement between our experimental observations and calculations based on the solutions of three-body Schr\""odinger equation in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation. The high efficiency of the exchange process is explained by the halo character of both the initial and final molecular states.",Human
It is well known from numerous experiments that nuclear multifragmentation is a dominating mechanism for production of intermediate-mass fragments in nucleus-nucleus collisions at energies above 100 A MeV. In this paper we investigate the validity and performance of the Fermi break-up model and the statistical multifragmentation model implemented as parts of the Geant4 toolkit. We study the impact of violent nuclear disintegration reactions on the depth-dose profiles and yields of secondary fragments for beams of light and medium-weight nuclei propagating in extended media. Implications for ion-beam cancer therapy and shielding from cosmic radiation are discussed.,Human
"The production of bound kaon-nucleon-states (kaonic-cluster) in the reaction $p+p\to [ppK^{-}] + K^{+}$ should be investigated in a dedicated measurement at the FOPI detector system at the SIS-accelerator of GSI, by looking for the decay $ppK^{-} \to p + \Lambda \to p + p + \pi^{-}$. To select the final states, the detector system Si$\Lambda$ViO has been build up as a trigger for $\Lambda$-Hyperons. This detector consists of two layers of segmented silicon-strip-detectors, which are able to measure online the particle multiplicity. These two layers are arranged such, that most of the $\Lambda$-Hyperons will decay between them. The trigger signal is generated by comparing online the hit multiplicity on the two layers.",Human
"We present a novel solution of the Mercury perihelion advance shift in the new gravity model. It is found that the non-relativistic reduction of the Dirac equation with the gravitational potential produces the new gravitational potential of $\displaystyle{V(r)=-{GMm\over r}+{G^2M^2m^2\over 2mc^2r^2}}$. This potential can explain the Mercury perihelion advance shift without any free parameters. Also, it can give rise to the $\omega-$shift of the GPS satellite where the advance shift amounts to $({\Delta \omega\over \omega})_{th} \simeq 3.4\times 10^{-10}$ which should be compared to the recent observed value of $({\Delta \omega\over \omega})_{exp} \simeq 4.5\times 10^{-10}$.",Human
"It is shown that nonlinear interaction between large amplitude circularly polarized EM wave and dusty plasma leads to a nonstationary ponderomotive force which in turn produces a vortex ring, and magnetic field. Then the ensuing vortex ring in the direction of propagation of the pump wave can accelerate the micron-size dust particles which are initially at rest and eventually form a non relativistic dust jet. This effect is purely nonstationary and unlike linear vortices, dust particles do not rotate here. Specifically, it is pointed out that the vortex ring or closed filament can become potential candidate for the acceleration of dust in tokamak plasmas.",Human
"Relativistic self-focusing and channeling of intense laser pulses have been studied in underdense plasma using 2D PIC simulations, for different laser powers and plasma densities. Analytical solutions for the stationary evacuated channels have been recovered in PIC simulations. It is shown that otherwise stable channels can accelerate electrons due to surface waves on the walls of the channels. Relativistic filaments with finite electron density are unstable to transverse modulations which lead in the nonlinear stage to the break-up of laser pulses into independent filaments. Different regimes of relativistic self-focusing and channeling, including electron heating, transverse instability and break-up of the filaments have been discussed and characterized using plasma density and laser power.",Human
"Purpose: to provide a view and analysis of the immediate field of journals which surround a number of key heterodox economics journals. Design/methodology/approach: Using citation data from the Science and Social Science Citation Index, the individual and collective networks of a number of journals in this field are analyzed. Findings: The size and shape of the citation networks of journals can differ substantially, even if in a broadly similar category. Heterodox economics cannot (yet) be considered as an integrated specialty: authors in several journals in heterodox economics cite more from mainstream economics than from other heterodox journals. There are also strong links with other disciplinary fields such as geography, development studies, women studies, etc.",Human
"Current methods for determining whether a time series exhibits fractal structure (FS) rely on subjective assessments on estimators of the Hurst exponent (H). Here, I introduce the Bayesian Assessment of Scaling, an analytical framework for drawing objective and accurate inferences on the FS of time series. The technique exploits the scaling property of the diffusion associated to a time series. The resulting criterion is simple to compute and represents an accurate characterization of the evidence supporting different hypotheses on the scaling regime of a time series. Additionally, a closed-form Maximum Likelihood estimator of H is derived from the criterion, and this estimator outperforms the best available estimators.",Human
"We have characterized two state-of-the-art solid-state photomultipliers, one by SensL, the other by Hamamatsu, coupled to scintillators by Saint-Gobain Crystals in the -25 to 50 degrees C temperature range. At room temperature, the energy resolution at 661.6 keV measured with both detectors is worse than the resolution obtained when the crystals are coupled to a regular photomultiplier tube. Both the pulse height and pulse height resolution of the 661.6 keV gamma rays in the 137Cs spectrum vary strongly with temperature. The noise threshold determined from the 22Na spectrum increases quadratically as the temperature is increased to well above 100 keV at +50 degrees C for both detectors.",Human
"We present a general description of the interaction between multi-color laser pulses and atoms and molecules, focusing on the experimentally relevant example of infrared (IR) pulses overlapped with attosecond pulse trains (APTs). This formulation reveals explicitly and analytically the role of the delay between the IR pulse and APT as a coherent control parameter. Our formulation also shows the nearly equivalent roles of the delay and the carrier-envelope phase in controlling the interference between different multiphoton pathways. We illustrate these points by investigating the single ionization of He and introduce dressed adiabatic hyperspherical potentials to aid the discussion. We confirm the predictions with a full-dimensional, two-electron solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation.",Human
"From the perspective of cultural studies and critical theory, Luhmann's communication-theoretical approach in sociology can still be read as a meta-biology: while biologists take the development of life as a given, Luhmann tends to treat the development of meaning as a cultural given. Meaning is no longer considered as constructed in communication, but meaning processing precedes and controls communication as an independent variable. Habermas appreciates Luhmann's distinction between psychic and social systems, but he challenges us to bring the critique of metaphysical issues (of providing meaning to events in a dialectics) back into this metabiological perspective that processes meaning without intentionality, that is, as a scientistic objectivation.",Human
"We distinguish between an internal differentiation of science and technology that focuses on instrumentalities and an external differentiation in terms of the relations of the knowledge production process to other social domains, notably governance and industry. The external contexts bring into play indicators and statistical techniques other than publications, patents, and citations. Using regression analysis, for example, one can examine the importance of knowledge and knowledge spill-over for economic development. The relations can be expected to vary among nations and regions. The field-specificity of changes is emphasized as a major driver of the research agenda. In a knowledge-based economy, institutional arrangements can be considered as support structures for cognitive developments.",Human
"If the history of science has taught us anything, it's that persistence and creativity makes the once impossible possible. It has long been thought experimental tests of quantum gravity are impossible. But during the last decade, several different approaches have been proposed that allow us to test, if not the fundamental theory of quantum gravity itself, so at least characteristic features this theory can have. For the first time we can probe experimentally domains in which quantum physics and gravity cohabit, in spite of our failure so far to make a convincing marriage of them on a theoretical level.",Human
"The Casimir-Polder force between two atoms with equal uniform acceleration and separated by a constant distance R is considered. We show that, in the low-acceleration limit, while the near-zone R^{-6} behavior of the interatomic interaction energy is not changed by the acceleration of the atoms, the far-zone interaction energy decreases as R^{-5} instead of the well-known R^{-7} behavior for inertial atoms. Possibility of an indirect detection of the Unruh effect through measurements of the Casimir-Polder force between the two accelerating atoms is also suggested. We also consider a heuristic model for calculating the Casimir-Polder potential energy between the two atoms in the high-acceleration limit.",Human
"We investigate various aspects of the statistics of leaders in growing network models defined by stochastic attachment rules. The leader is the node with highest degree at a given time (or the node which reached that degree first if there are co-leaders). This comprehensive study includes the full distribution of the degree of the leader, its identity, the number of co-leaders, as well as several observables characterizing the whole history of lead changes: number of lead changes, number of distinct leaders, lead persistence probability. We successively consider the following network models: uniform attachment, linear attachment (the Barabasi-Albert model), and generalized preferential attachment with initial attractiveness.",Human
"When a one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor nanostructure is immersed in a sluggish polar solvent, fluctuations of the medium may result in the appearance of localized electronic levels inside the band gap. An excess charge carrier can occupy such a level and undergo self-localization into a large-radius adiabatic polaron surrounded by a self-consistent medium polarization pattern. Within an appropriately adapted framework of the Marcus theory, we explore the description and qualitative picture of thermally activated electron transfer involving solvation-induced polaronic-like states by considering transfer between small and 1D species as well as between two 1D species. Illustrative calculations are performed for tubular geometries with possible applications to carbon nanotube systems.",Human
"As an introduction to the special issue on ""emerging nanotechnologies"", this paper puts in perspective contemporary debates and challenges about nanotechnology. It presents an overview of diverse analyses and expectations about this presumably revolutionary set of technological, scientific and industrial developments. Three main lines of argument can then be delineated: first of all, the degree of cumulativeness of science and technologies and the respective roles of newcomers and incumbents in the industrial dynamics; second the knowledge dynamics in nanotechnologies, especially the linkages by science and technology and third the role of institutions (network, geographic agglomeration and job market). It finally discusses methodologies to delineate the field of nanotechnologies and to collect data.",Human
"The stable structures and melting properties of ion clouds in isotropic octupole traps are investigated using a combination of semi-analytical and numerical models, with a particular emphasis at finite size scaling effects. Small-size clouds are found to be hollow and arranged in shells corresponding approximately to the solutions of the Thomson problem. The shell structure is lost in clusters containing more than a few thousands of ions, the inner parts of the cloud becoming soft and amorphous. While melting is triggered in the core shells, the melting temperature unexpectedly follows the rule expected for three-dimensional dense particles, with a depression scaling linearly with the inverse radius.",Human
"A problem of finding the linear theory satisfaction limits in propagation of the internal gravity waves is considered. It is evident that internal gravity waves excitation, propagation in actual practice is highly nonlinear phenomenon. However with some reasonable assumptions it is possible to linearize equations of internal waves generation and propagation. It is shown that in interesting for us wavelength range we can use linear approximation during study of internal gravity waves dynamics. Similarly it is easy to evaluate also influence of other corrections to the linear theory of internal gravity waves generation and propagation, and the obtained results indicate adequacy and supportability of linear model wave dynamics.",Human
"Different ways to achieve the stabilization of a linear z-pinch by a superimposed shear flow are analyzed. They are: 1) Axial shear flow proposed by Arber and Howell with the pinch discharge in its center, and experimentally tested by Shumlak et al. 2) Spiral flow of a dense low temperature plasma surrounding a dense pinch discharge. 3) A thin metallic projectile shot at a high velocity through the center of the pinch discharge. 4) The replacement of the high velocity projectile by the shape charge effect jet in a conical implosion. 5) The replacement of the jet by a stationary wire inside the conical implosion.",Human
"In this introduction the editors showcase the papers by way of a structured project and seek to clarify the two key concepts cited in the title. We consider the history of the idea that knowledge is an economic factor, and discuss the question of whether regions provide the relevant system of reference for knowledge-based economic development. Current transformations in university-industry-government relations at various levels can be considered as a metamorphosis in industry organization. The concept of constructed advantage will be elaborated. The various papers arising from a conference on this subject hosted by Memorial University, Newfoundland, Canada are approached from this perspective.",Human
"Various real-life networks of current interest are simultaneously scale-free and modular. Here we study analytically the average distance in a class of deterministically growing scale-free modular networks. By virtue of the recursive relations derived from the self-similar structure of the networks, we compute rigorously this important quantity, obtaining an explicit closed-form solution, which recovers the previous result and is corroborated by extensive numerical calculations. The obtained exact expression shows that the average distance scales logarithmically with the number of nodes in the networks, indicating an existence of small-world behavior. We present that this small-world phenomenon comes from the peculiar architecture of the network family.",Human
"We have considered an effect of atomic electrons due to the electronic bridge process on the nuclear $^{229m}$Th -- $^{229g}$Th transition in ^{229}$Th$^{3+}$. Based on a recent experimental result we assumed the energy difference between the isomeric and the ground nuclear states to be equal to 7.6 eV. We have calculated the ratios of the electronic bridge process probability Gamma_EB to the probability of the nuclear radiative transition (Gamma_N) for the electronic 5f_5/2 --> 6d_3/2,6d_5/2,7s and the 7s --> 7p_1/2,7p_3/2 transitions and found Gamma_EB/Gamma_N ~ 0.01-0.1 for the former and Gamma_EB/Gamma_N ~ 20 for the latter.",Human
"In this paper, we apply transformation-based optics to the derivation of a general class of transparent metamaterial slabs. By means of analytical and numerical full-wave studies, we explore their image displacement/formation capabilities, and establish intriguing connections with configurations already known in the literature. Starting from these revisitations, we develop a number of nontrivial extensions, and illustrate their possible applications to the design of perfect radomes, anti-cloaking devices, and focusing devices based on double-positive (possibly nonmagnetic) media. These designs show that such anomalous features may be achieved without necessarily relying on negative-index or strongly resonant metamaterials, suggesting more practical venues for the realization of these devices.",Human
"We explain simple laboratory experiments for making quantitative measurements of the Doppler effect from sources with acceleration. We analyze the spectra and clarify the conditions for the Doppler effect to be experimentally measurable, which turn out to be non-trivial when acceleration is involved. The experiments use sources with gravitational acceleration, in free fall and in motion as a pendulum, so that the results can be checked against fundamental physics principles. The experiments can be easily set up from ``off the shelf'' components only. The experiments are suitable for a wide range of students, including undergraduates not majoring in science or engineering.",Human
"We theoretically and numerically investigated the threshold network model with a generic weight function where there were a large number of nodes and a high threshold. Our analysis was based on extreme value theory, which gave us a theoretical understanding of the distribution of independent and identically distributed random variables within a sufficiently high range. Specifically, the distribution could be generally expressed by a generalized Pareto distribution, which enabled us to formulate the generic weight distribution function. By using the theorem, we obtained the exact expressions of degree distribution and clustering coefficient which behaved as universal power laws within certain ranges of degrees. We also compared the theoretical predictions with numerical results and found that they were extremely consistent.",Human
"We present a photoionization method to load single 40Ca ions in a linear Paul trap from an atomic beam. Neutral Ca I atoms are resonantly excited from the ground state to the intermediate 4s4p 1P_1-level using coherent 423nm radiation produced by single-pass second harmonic generation in a periodically poled KTiOPO_4 crystal pumped with an 120mW extended cavity diode laser. Ionization is then attained with a high-power light emitting diode imaged to the trap center, using an appropriately designed optical system composed of standard achromatic doublet lenses. The setup simplifies previous implementations at similar efficiency, and it hardly requires any maintenance at all.",Human
"A long standing issue in Hydrology is the arbitrariness of the rain ""event"" definition. In this manuscript, we show that 1) the event definition resting on the occurrence of a minimum rainless period and the one resting a sequence of consecutive wet intervals are statistically equivalent. 2) In the case of stratiform rain, a non arbitrary definition of rain event is possible. The dynamical properties of stratiform rain indicate the range [1.5,4] h as the proper one for the choice of a minimum rainless period for Chilbolton, UK. 3) The intra event dynamical variability is ""described"" by an alternate sequence of quiescent and active phases.",Human
"Selection of operating wavelength of the Yb-doped fiber-ring lasers using longperiod fiber gratings (LPFGs) is suggested. In the proposed method, customized LPFG that sustains high powers serves as a broad-band rejection filter. It modifies the net gain profile of the laser, enabling the peak gain to occur at a designed wavelength. Spectral range of oscillation between 1050-1110 nm was experimentally demonstrated. This range can be extended to both shorter and longer wavelengths with proper design of the LPFG and length of the Yb-doped fiber. The gratings were inscribed by CO2 laser and the grating period down to 175 ?m was achieved being, to our best knowledge, the shortest reported LPFG period using this technique.",Human
"We describe the architecture evolution of the highly-parallel dedicated processor FTK, which is driven by the simulation of LHC events at high luminosity (1034 cm-2 s-1). FTK is able to provide precise on-line track reconstruction for future hadronic collider experiments. The processor, organized in a two-tiered pipelined architecture, execute very fast algorithms based on the use of a large bank of pre-stored patterns of trajectory points (first tier) in combination with full resolution track fitting to refine pattern recognition and to determine off-line quality track parameters. We describe here how the high luminosity simulation results have produced a new organization of the hardware inside the FTK processor core.",Human
"The CMS muon system has been aligned using cosmic-ray muons collected in 2008 and beam-halo muons from the 2008 LHC circulating beam tests. After alignment, the resolution of the most sensitive coordinate is 80 microns for the relative positions of superlayers in the same barrel chamber and 270 microns for the relative positions of endcap chambers in the same ring structure. The resolution on the position of the central barrel chambers relative to the tracker is comprised between two extreme estimates, 200 and 700 microns, provided by two complementary studies. With minor modifications, the alignment procedures can be applied using muons from LHC collisions, leading to additional significant improvements.",Human
"Recently demonstrated superconducting atom-chips provide a platform for trapping atoms and coupling them to solid-state quantum systems. Controlling these devices requires a full understanding of the supercurrent distribution in the trapping structures. For type-II superconductors, this distribution is hysteretic in the critical state due to the partial penetration of the magnetic field in the thin superconducting film through pinned vortices. We report here an experimental observation of this memory effect. Our results are in good agreement with the redictions of the Bean model of the critical state without adjustable parameters. The memory effect allows to write and store permanent currents in micron-sized superconducting structures and paves the way towards new types of engineered trapping potentials.",Human
"The use of Pearson's correlation coefficient in Author Cocitation Analysis was compared with Salton's cosine measure in a number of recent contributions. Unlike the Pearson correlation, the cosine is insensitive to the number of zeros. However, one has the option of applying a logarithmic transformation in correlation analysis. Information calculus is based on both the logarithmic transformation and provides a non-parametric statistics. Using this methodology one can cluster a document set in a precise way and express the differences in terms of bits of information. The algorithm is explained and used on the data set which was made the subject of this discussion.",Human
"We measure the sensitivity of a broadband atomic magnetometer using quantum non-demolition spin measurements. A cold, dipole-trapped sample of rubidium atoms provides a long-lived spin system in a non-magnetic environment, and is probed non-destructively by paramagnetic Faraday rotation. The calibration procedure employs a known reference state, the maximum-entropy or 'thermal' spin state and quantitative imaging-based atom counting to identify electronic, quantum, and technical noise in both the probe and spin system. The measurement achieves sensitivity 2.8 dB better than the projection noise level (6dB better if optical noise is suppressed) and will enable squeezing-enhanced broadband magnetometry [Geremia, et al. PRL 94, 203002 (2005)].",Human
"We investigate the nonlinear response of photonic crystal waveguides with suppressed two-photon absorption. A moderate decrease of the group velocity (~ c/6 to c/15, a factor of 2.5) results in a dramatic (30x) enhancement of three-photon absorption well beyond the expected scaling, proportional to 1/(vg)^3. This non-trivial scaling of the effective nonlinear coefficients results from pulse compression, which further enhances the optical field beyond that of purely slow-group velocity interactions. These observations are enabled in mm-long slow-light photonic crystal waveguides owing to the strong anomalous group-velocity dispersion and positive chirp. Our numerical physical model matches measurements remarkably.",Human
"We propose a novel method to reconstruct the spatio-temporal amplitude and phase of the electric field of ultrashort laser pulses using spatially-resolved spectral interferometry. This method is based on a fiber-optic coupler interferometer that has certain advantages in comparison with standard interferometer systems, such as it being alignment-free and selection of the reference beam at a single point. Our technique, which we refer to as STARFISH, offers compactness and simplicity. We report its application to the experimental characterization of chirped pulses and to spatio-temporal reconstructions of a convergent beam as well as plane-plane and spherical-plane waves interferences, which we check with our simulations.",Human
"A series of peculiar, visual alignments between the pyramids of the pharaohs of the 4, 5 and 6 Egyptian dynasties exists. These alignments governed from the very beginning the planning of the funerary monuments of successive kings and, in some cases, led to establish building sites in quite inconvenient locations from the technical viewpoint. Explaining the topography of these monuments means therefore also investigating on their symbolic motivations: religion, power, dynastic lineage and social context, as well as getting insights on the skills of the ancient architects in astronomy and geometry. In the present paper we focus on the relationships between the Old Kingdom pyramids at Saqqara.",Human
"The origin of photodamage of single cells confined in laser tweezers is determined by comparison of action spectra with these recorded for a photoinduced response of cell populations. Triplet-singlet transitions in dissolved oxygen provide a common cause of both phenomena. Such transitions are forbidden in isolated O2 molecules, but occur in solutions due to the formation of temporary oxygen-solvent complexes. In dependence on the photon energy oxygen molecules may be excited alone or in combination with roto-vibrational excitations in H2O. The photodamage is a consequence of a toxic action produced by the singlet oxygen 1O2 (1.DELTA.gO2.).",Human
"The nonaxisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes in a zero-beta cylindrical compressible thin magnetic flux tube modelled as a twisted core surrounded by a magnetically twisted annulus, both embedded in a straight ambient external field is considered. The dispersion relation is derived and solved analytically and numerically to obtain the frequencies of the nonaxisymmetric MHD waves. The main result is that the twisted magnetic annulus does affect the period ratio P_1/P_2 of the kink modes. For the kink modes, the magnetic twist in the annulus region can achieve deviations from P_1/P_2 = 2 of the same order of magnitude as in the observations. Furthermore, the effect of the internal twist on the fluting modes is investigated.",Human
"We propose a novel distributed algorithm to cluster graphs. The algorithm recovers the solution obtained from spectral clustering without the need for expensive eigenvalue/vector computations. We prove that, by propagating waves through the graph, a local fast Fourier transform yields the local component of every eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix, thus providing clustering information. For large graphs, the proposed algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than random walk based approaches. We prove the equivalence of the proposed algorithm to spectral clustering and derive convergence rates. We demonstrate the benefit of using this decentralized clustering algorithm for community detection in social graphs, accelerating distributed estimation in sensor networks and efficient computation of distributed multi-agent search strategies.",Human
"The alignment system for the muon spectrometer of the CMS detector comprises three independent subsystems of optical and analog position sensors. It aligns muon chambers with respect to each other and to the central silicon tracker. System commissioning at full magnetic field began in 2008 during an extended cosmic ray run. The system succeeded in tracking muon detector movements of up to 18 mm and rotations of several milliradians under magnetic forces. Depending on coordinate and subsystem, the system achieved chamber alignment precisions of 140-350 microns and 30-200 microradians, close to the precision requirements of the experiment. Systematic errors on absolute positions are estimated to be 340-590 microns based on comparisons with independent photogrammetry measurements.",Human
"The CMS Collaboration conducted a month-long data-taking exercise known as the Cosmic Run At Four Tesla in late 2008 in order to complete the commissioning of the experiment for extended operation. The operational lessons resulting from this exercise were addressed in the subsequent shutdown to better prepare CMS for LHC beams in 2009. The cosmic data collected have been invaluable to study the performance of the detectors, to commission the alignment and calibration techniques, and to make several cosmic ray measurements. The experimental setup, conditions, and principal achievements from this data-taking exercise are described along with a review of the preceding integration activities.",Human
"Commissioning studies of the CMS hadron calorimeter have identified sporadic uncharacteristic noise and a small number of malfunctioning calorimeter channels. Algorithms have been developed to identify and address these problems in the data. The methods have been tested on cosmic ray muon data, calorimeter noise data, and single beam data collected with CMS in 2008. The noise rejection algorithms can be applied to LHC collision data at the trigger level or in the offline analysis. The application of the algorithms at the trigger level is shown to remove 90% of noise events with fake missing transverse energy above 100 GeV, which is sufficient for the CMS physics trigger operation.",Human
"This paper describes the calibration procedure for the drift tubes of the CMS barrel muon system and reports the main results obtained with data collected during a high statistics cosmic ray data-taking period. The main goal of the calibration is to determine, for each drift cell, the minimum time delay for signals relative to the trigger, accounting for the drift velocity within the cell. The accuracy of the calibration procedure is influenced by the random arrival time of the cosmic muons relative to the LHC clock cycle. A more refined analysis of the drift velocity was performed during the offline reconstruction phase, which takes into account this feature of cosmic ray events.",Human
"The propagation of ultra intense laser pulses through matter is connected with the generation of strong moving magnetic fields in the propagation channel as well as the formation of a thin ion filament along the axis of the channel. Upon exiting the plasma the magnetic field displaces the electrons at the back of the target, generating a quasistatic electric field that accelerates and collimates ions from the filament. Two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations show that a 1 PW laser pulse tightly focused on a near-critical density target is able to accelerate protons up to an energy of 1.3 GeV. Scaling laws and optimal conditions for proton acceleration are established considering the energy depletion of the laser pulse.",Human
"The performance of muon reconstruction in CMS is evaluated using a large data sample of cosmic-ray muons recorded in 2008. Efficiencies of various high-level trigger, identification, and reconstruction algorithms have been measured for a broad range of muon momenta, and were found to be in good agreement with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. The relative momentum resolution for muons crossing the barrel part of the detector is better than 1% at 10 GeV/c and is about 8% at 500 GeV/c, the latter being only a factor of two worse than expected with ideal alignment conditions. Muon charge misassignment ranges from less than 0.01% at 10 GeV/c to about 1% at 500 GeV/c.",Human
"During autumn 2008, the Silicon Strip Tracker was operated with the full CMS experiment in a comprehensive test, in the presence of the 3.8 T magnetic field produced by the CMS superconducting solenoid. Cosmic ray muons were detected in the muon chambers and used to trigger the readout of all CMS sub-detectors. About 15 million events with a muon in the tracker were collected. The efficiency of hit and track reconstruction were measured to be higher than 99% and consistent with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. This article details the commissioning and performance of the Silicon Strip Tracker with cosmic ray muons.",Human
"This paper describes an imaging microscopic technique based on heterodyne digital holography where subwavelength-sized gold colloids can be imaged in cell environment. Surface cellular receptors of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts are labeled with 40 nm gold nanoparticles, and the biological specimen is imaged in a total internal reflection configuration with holographic microscopy. Due to a higher scattering efficiency of the gold nanoparticles versus that of cellular structures, accurate localization of a gold marker is obtained within a 3D mapping of the entire sample's scattered field, with a lateral precision of 5 nm and 100 nm in the x,y and in the z directions respectively, demonstrating the ability of holographic microscopy to locate nanoparticles in living cells environments.",Human
"We present here a methodology, using holographic interferometry, enabling to measure the pure surface reaction rate constant of the dissolution of a mineral in water, unambiguously free from the influence of mass transport. We use that technique to access to this value for gypsum and we demonstrate that it was never measured before but could be deduced a posteriori from the literature results if hydrodynamics is taken into account with accuracy. It is found to be much smaller than expected. This method enables to provide reliable rate constants for the test of dissolution models and the interpretation of in situ measurements, and gives clues to explain the inconsistency between dissolution rates of calcite and aragonite, for instance, in the literature.",Human
"The Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) silicon tracking detectors (Tracker) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is a software based system designed to monitor the detector and reconstruction performance, to identify problems and to certify the collected data for physics analysis. It uses the framework provided by the central CMS DQM as well as tools developed especially for the CMS Tracker DQM. This paper describes aim, framework conditions, tools and work flows of the CMS Tracker DQM and shows examples of its successful use during the recent commissioning phase of the CMS experiment.",Human
"We present the implementation of tailored trapping potentials for ultracold gases on an atom chip. We realize highly elongated traps with box-like confinement along the long, axial direction combined with conventional harmonic confinement along the two radial directions. The design, fabrication and characterization of the atom chip and the box traps is described. We load ultracold ($\lesssim1 \mu$K) clouds of $^{87}$Rb in a box trap, and demonstrate Bose-gas focusing as a means to characterize these atomic clouds in arbitrarily shaped potentials. Our results show that box-like axial potentials on atom chips are very promising for studies of one-dimensional quantum gases.",Human
"We have studied the afterpulse of a hemispherical photomultiplier tube for an upcoming reactor neutrino experiment. The timing, the amplitude, and the rate of the afterpulse for a 10 inch photomultiplier tube were measured with a 400 MHz FADC up to 16 \ms time window after the initial signal generated by an LED light pulse. The time and amplitude correlation of the afterpulse shows several distinctive groups. We describe the dependencies of the afterpulse on the applied high voltage and the amplitude of the main light pulse. The present data could shed light upon the general mechanism of the afterpulse.",Human
"We report on a fiber-stabilized agile laser with ultra-low frequency noise. The frequency noise power spectral density is comparable to that of an ultra-stable cavity stabilized laser at Fourier frequencies higher than 30 Hz. When it is chirped at a constant rate of ~ 40 MHz/s, the max non-linearity frequency error is about 50 Hz peak-to-peak over more than 600 MHz tuning range. The Rayleigh backscattering is found to be a significant frequency noise source dependent on fiber length, chirping rate and the power imbalance of the interferometer arms. We analyze this effect both theoretically and experimentally and put forward techniques to reduce this noise contribution.",Human
"A large sample of cosmic ray events collected by the CMS detector is exploited to measure the specific energy loss of muons in the lead tungstate of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The measurement spans a momentum range from 5 GeV/c to 1 TeV/c. The results are consistent with the expectations over the entire range. The calorimeter energy scale, set with 120 GeV/c electrons, is validated down to the sub-GeV region using energy deposits, of order 100 MeV, associated with low-momentum muons. The muon critical energy in lead tungstate is measured to be 160+5/-6 plus or minus 8 GeV, in agreement with expectations. This is the first experimental determination of muon critical energy.",Human
"A pulse shape analysis algorithm and a method for suppressing the noise component of signals from a large copper proportional counter in the experiment aimed at searching for 2K capture of Kr-78 are described. These signals correspond to a compound event with different numbers of charge clusters due to from primary ionization is formed by these signals. A technique for separating single- and multipoint events and determining the charge in individual clusters is presented. Using the Daubechies wavelets in multiresolutional signal analysis, it is possible to increase the sensitivity and the resolution in extraction of multipoint events in the detector by a factor of 3-4.",Human
"General principles for the existence of perfect transmission resonances in photonic multilayer structures are formulated in terms of light interference described by recurrent Airy formulas. Mirror symmetry in the multilayer is shown to be a sufficient but not necessary condition for perfect transmission resonances. Asymmetric structures displaying perfect transmission in accordance with the proposed principles are demonstrated. A hybrid Fabry-Perot/photonic-crystal structure of the type (BA)^k(AB)^k(AABB)^m is proposed, combining perfect transmission and highly asymmetric electric field localization. Strength and asymmetry of localization can be controlled independently, to be of use in tailoring non-reciprocal behavior of nonlinear all-optical diodes.",Human
"Discussing the limitations on the validity of classical electrodynamics, we show that present day laser pulse technology applied to head-on-collisions with relativistic electrons generates fields strong enough to permit experimentation at the limits of validity of the Lorentz force, and the development of experimental tests of Mach's principle. We also discuss more distant opportunities for exploring the nature of laws of physics and the vacuum structure. We then conclude that the predictions of quantum electrodynamics in the presence of critical fields are not completely satisfactory and argue that the study of Laser materialization into particle pairs opens a new domain of quantum electrodynamics.",Human
"In this paper, we mathematically formulate the interaction and dynamics of a hierarchical complex social system where each agent is seen as an array of many variables. The formation of identities and modifications can be studied by using interaction physics in an energy landscape. The spin glass Hamiltonian is modified to suit our needs in light of complexity. The expression of variables subject to weights and topology is considered. Interactions within the same hierarchy level as well as the effect of one hierarchy level on another are studied. The effect of having many variables associated with a single agent brings about interesting dynamics. The persistence of the identity units subject to stiffness, continuous changes and also sudden reorganizations is discussed.",Human
Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) have been successfully used in several high energy physics experiments over the past two decades. Their high spatial resolution and thin sensitive layers make them an excellent tool for studying short-lived particles. The Linear Collider Flavour Identification (LCFI) Collaboration has been developing Column-Parallel CCDs for the vertex detector of a future Linear Collider which can be read out many times faster than standard CCDs. The most recent studies are of devices designed to reduce both the CCD's intergate capacitance and the clock voltages necessary to drive it. A comparative study of measured Charge Transfer Inefficiency values between our previous and new results for a range of operating temperatures is presented.,Human
"This article presents a generic method to solve 2D multi-objective placement problem for free-form components. The proposed method is a relaxed placement technique combined with an hybrid algorithm based on a genetic algorithm and a separation algorithm. The genetic algorithm is used as a global optimizer and is in charge of efficiently exploring the search space. The separation algorithm is used to legalize solutions proposed by the global optimizer, so that placement constraints are satisfied. A test case illustrates the application of the proposed method. Extensions for solving the 3D problem are given at the end of the article.",Human
"In this work we present a cosmic ray model that couples primary solar cosmic rays at the top of the Earth's atmosphere with the secondary ones detected at ground level by neutron monitors during Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs). The Neutron Monitor Based Anisotropic GLE Pure Power Law (NMBANGLE PPOLA) Model constitutes a new version of the already existing NMBANGLE Model, differing in the solar cosmic ray spectrum assumed. The total output of the model is a multi-dimensional GLE picture that reveals part of the characteristics of the big solar proton events recorded at ground level. We apply both versions of the model to the GLE of 15 April 2001 (GLE60) and compare the results.",Human
"Visible light photon counters (VLPCs) offer many attractive features as photon detectors, such as high quantum efficiency and photon number resolution. We report measurements of the single-photon timing jitter in a VLPC, a critical performance factor in a time-correlated single-photon counting measurement, in a fiber-coupled closed-cycle cryocooler. The measured timing jitter is 240 ps full-width-at-half-maximum at a wavelength of 550 nm, with a dark count rate of 25 000 counts per second. The timing jitter increases modestly at longer wavelengths to 300 ps at 1000 nm, and increases substantially at lower bias voltages as the quantum efficiency is reduced.",Human
"We report on experiments of drop impacting a hydrophobic micro-grid, of typical spacing a few tens of $\mu$m. Above a threshold in impact speed, liquid emerges to the other side, forming micro-droplets of size about that of the grid holes. We propose a method to produce either a mono-disperse spray or a single tiny droplet of volume as small as a few picoliters corresponding to a volume division of the liquid drop by a factor of up to 10$^5$. We also discuss the discrepancy of the measured thresholds with that predicted by a balance between inertia and capillarity.",Human
"Streamer discharges are important both in theory and industry applications. This paper proposed a local discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate the convection dominated fluid model of streamer discharges. To simulate the rapid transient streamer discharge process, a method with high resolution and high order accuracy is highly desired. Combining the advantages of finite volume and finite element method, local discontinuous Galerkin method is such a choice. In this paper, a simulation of a double-headed streamer discharge in nitrogen was performed by using 1.5-dimensional fluid model. The preliminary results indicate the potential of extending the method to general streamer simulations in complex geometries.",Human
"The instability and nonlinear evolution of directional ocean waves is investigated numerically by means of simulations of the governing kinetic equation for narrow-band surface waves. Our simulation results reveal the onset of the modulational instability for long-crested wave-trains, which agrees well with recent large-scale experiments in wave-basins, where it was found that narrower directional spectra leads to self-focusing of ocean waves and an enhanced probability of extreme events. We find that the modulational instability is nonlinearly saturated by a broadening of the wave-spectrum, which leads to the stabilization of the water-wave system. Applications of our results to other fields of physics, such as nonlinear optics and plasma physics are discussed.",Human
"There are few good direct laboratory tests of boost invariance for electrons, because the experiments required often involve repeated precision measurements performed at different times of year. However, existing measurements and remeasurements of the 2S-1S two-photon transition frequency in H--which were done to search for a time variation in the fine structure constant--also constitute a measurement of the boost symmetry violation parameter 0.83c_(TX) + 0.51c_(TY) + 0.22c_(TZ) = (4 +/- 8) x 10^(-11). This is an eight order of magnitude improvement over preexisting laboratory bounds, and with only one additional measurements, this system could yield a second comparable constraint.",Human
The disease spreading on complex networks is studied in SIR model. Simulations on empirical complex networks reveal two specific regimes of disease spreading: local containment and epidemic outbreak. The variables measuring the extent of disease spreading are in general characterized by a bimodal probability distribution. Phase diagrams of disease spreading for empirical complex networks are introduced. A theoretical model of disease spreading on m-ary tree is investigated both analytically and in simulations. It is shown that the model reproduces qualitative features of phase diagrams of disease spreading observed in empirical complex networks. The role of tree-like structure of complex networks in disease spreading is discussed.,Human
"In this work we suggest very simple solution of the two capacitors paradox in the completely ideal (without any electrical resistance or inductive) electrical circuit. Namely, it is shown that electrical field energy loss corresponds to works done by electrical fields of both capacitors by movement of the electrical charge. It is all and nothing more (some dissipation processes, e.g. Joule heating and electromagnetic wave emission effects) is necessary. Additionally, we shortly demonstrate a simple mechanical analogy of mentioned paradox and its solution. Concretely we consider two water buckets connected by a valve where is a seeming loss of the gravitational potential energy that can be explained by the work in the gravitational field.",Human
"Metamaterials, artificial media structured on the subwavelength scale offer a rich paradigm for developing unique photonic functionalities ranging from negative index of refraction and directionally asymmetric transmission to slowing light. Here we demonstrate that a combination of carbon nanotubes with a photonic metamaterial offers a new paradigm for the development of nonlinear media with exceptionally strong ultrafast nonlinear response invaluable in photonic applications. It is underpinned by strong coupling between weakly radiating Fano-type resonant plasmonic modes and the excitonic response of single-walled semiconductor carbon nanotubes. Using a ""combinatorial"" approach to material discovery we show that the optical response of such a composite system can be tailored and optimized by metamaterial design.",Human
"We demonstrate a silicon photonic platform using thin buried oxide silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates using localized substrate removal. We show high confinement silicon strip waveguides, micro-ring resonators and nanotapers using this technology. Propagation losses for the waveguides using the cutback method are 3.88 dB/cm for the quasi-TE mode and 5.06 dB/cm for the quasi-TM mode. Ring resonators with a loaded quality factor (Q) of 46,500 for the quasi-TM mode and intrinsic Q of 148,000 for the quasi-TE mode have been obtained. This process will enable the integration of photonic structures with thin buried oxide SOI based electronics.",Human
"In the last decade the broad scope of complex networks has led to a rapid progress. In this area a particular interest has the study of community structures. The analysis of this type of structure requires the formalization of the intuitive concept of community and the definition of indices of goodness for the obtained results. A lot of algorithms has been presented to reach this goal. In particular, an interesting problem is the search of overlapped communities and it is field seems very interesting a solution based on the use of genetic algorithms. The approach discusses in this paper is based on a parallel implementation of a genetic algorithm and shows the performance benefits of this solution.",Human
"Requiring all massless elementary fields to have conformal scaling symmetry removes a conflict between gravitational theory and the quantum theory of elementary particles and fields. Extending this postulate to the scalar field of the Higgs model, dynamical breaking of both gauge and conformal symmetries determines parameters for the interacting fields. In uniform isotropic geometry a modified Friedmann cosmic evolution equation is derived with nonvanishing cosmological constant. Parameters determined by numerical solution are consistent with empirical data for redshifts $z\leq z_*=1090$, including luminosity distances for observed type Ia supernovae and peak structure ratios in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The theory does not require dark matter.",Human
"The ``High school class for students with special abilities in physics`` was founded in Nis, Serbia in 2003. The basic aim of this project has been introducing a broadened curriculum of physics, mathematics, computer science, as well as chemistry and biology. We present analysis of the pupils` skills in solving rather problem oriented test, as PISA test, and compare their results with the results of pupils who study under standard curricula. Analysis of achievement data should clarify what are benefits of introducing in school system track for gifted students. Additionally, item analysis helps in understanding and improvement of learning strategies efficacy.",Human
"We present a scheme for entangling the atoms of an optical lattice to reduce the quantum projection noise of a clock measurement. The divalent clock atoms are held in a lattice at a ``magic'' wavelength that does not perturb the clock frequency -- to maintain clock accuracy -- while an open-shell J=1/2 ``head'' atom is coherently transported between lattice sites via the lattice polarization. This polarization-dependent ``Archimedes' screw'' transport at magic wavelength takes advantage of the vanishing vector polarizability of the scalar, J=0, clock states of bosonic isotopes of divalent atoms. The on-site interactions between the clock atoms and the head atom are used to engineer entanglement and for clock readout.",Human
"The forward and inverse wavelet transform using the continuous Morlet basis may be symmetrized by using an appropriate normalization factor. The loss of response due to wavelet truncation is addressed through a renormalization of the wavelet based on power. The spectral density has physical units which may be related to the squared amplitude of the signal, as do its margins the mean wavelet power and the integrated instant power, giving a quantitative estimate of the power density with temporal resolution. Deconvolution with the wavelet response matrix reduces the spectral leakage and produces an enhanced wavelet spectrum providing maximum resolution of the harmonic content of a signal. Applications to data analysis are discussed.",Human
"Trapping and optically interfacing laser-cooled neutral atoms is an essential requirement for their use in advanced quantum technologies. Here we simultaneously realize both of these tasks with cesium atoms interacting with a multi-color evanescent field surrounding an optical nanofiber. The atoms are localized in a one-dimensional optical lattice about 200 nm above the nanofiber surface and can be efficiently interrogated with a resonant light field sent through the nanofiber. Our technique opens the route towards the direct integration of laser-cooled atomic ensembles within fiber networks, an important prerequisite for large scale quantum communication schemes. Moreover, it is ideally suited to the realization of hybrid quantum systems that combine atoms with, e.g., solid state quantum devices.",Human
"The aggregated journal-journal citation matrix derived from the Journal Citation Reports 2001 can be decomposed into a unique subject classification by using the graph-analytical algorithm of bi-connected components. This technique was recently incorporated in software tools for social network analysis. The matrix can be assessed in terms of its decomposability using articulation points which indicate overlap between the components. The articulation points of this set did not exhibit a next-order network of 'general science' journals. However, the clusters differ in size and in terms of the internal density of their relations. A full classification of the journals is provided in an Appendix. The clusters can also be extracted and mapped for the visualization.",Human
"Organized knowledge production can then be considered as the codification of communication. Communications leave traces that can be studied as indicators. Institutions can be considered as retention mechanisms functional for the reproduction of ever more complex, that is, scientific and knowledge-based, communications. The focus on communication enables us to operationalize the research questions in terms of indicators by using the mathematical theory of communication. The combination of two theories with a very different status--i.e., a combination of theory and methods--enables us to update and inform empirical hypotheses about how the knowledge base transforms the institutional relations of an increasingly knowledge-based society. Policy implications are specified.",Human
"The competitive advantages in a knowledge-based economy can no longer be attributed to single nodes in the network. Political economies are increasingly reshaped by knowledge-based developments that upset market equilibria and institutional arrangements. The network coordinates the subdynamics of (i) wealth production, (ii) organized novelty production, and (iii) private appropriation versus public control. The interaction terms generate a complex dynamics which cannot be expected to contain central coordination. However, the knowledge infrastructure of systems of innovations can be measured, for example, in terms of university-industry-government relations. The mutual information in these three dimensions indicates the globalization of the knowledge base. Patent statistics and data from the Internet are compared in terms of this indicator.",Human
"We describe a versatile planar Penning trap structure, which allows to dynamically modify the trapping conguration almost arbitrarily. The trap consists of 37 hexagonal electrodes, each with a circumcirle-diameter of 300 m, fabricated in a gold-on-sapphire lithographic technique. Every hexagon can be addressed individually, thus shaping the electric potential. The fabrication of such a device with clean room methods is demonstrated. We illustrate the variability of the device by a detailed numerical simulation of a lateral and a vertical transport and we simulate trapping in racetrack and articial crystal congurations. The trap may be used for ions or electrons, as a versatile container for quantum optics and quantum information experiments.",Human
"We report results of lattice Boltzmann simulations of a high-speed drainage of liquid films squeezed between a smooth sphere and a randomly rough plane. A significant decrease in the hydrodynamic resistance force as compared with that predicted for two smooth surfaces is observed. However, this force reduction does not represent slippage. The computed force is exactly the same as that between equivalent smooth surfaces obeying no-slip boundary conditions, but located at an intermediate position between peaks and valleys of asperities. The shift in hydrodynamic thickness is shown to depend on the height and density of roughness elements. Our results do not support some previous experimental conclusions on very large and shear-dependent boundary slip for similar systems.",Human
"It is a remarkable fact that all processes occurring in the observable Universe are irreversible, whereas the equations in which the laws of physics are formulated are invariant under time reversal. The emergency of irreversibility from the fundamental laws has been a topic of consideration by physicists, astronomers and philosophers since Boltzmann's formulation of the ""H"" theorem. In this paper I shall discuss several aspects of this problem and its connection with the dynamics of space-time, within the framework of modern cosmology. I shall comment, briefly, on the nature of physical time and its relation with the so-called ""consciousness"".",Human
"We discuss the detection limit for refractometric sensors relying on high-Q optical cavities and show that the ultimate classical detection limit is given by min{Dn} > eta with n+i*eta being the complex refractive index of the material under refractometric investigation. Taking finite Q factors and filling fractions into account, the detection limit declines. As an example we discuss the fundamental limits of silicon-based high-Q resonators, such as photonic crystal resonators, for sensing in a bio-liquid environment, such as a water buffer. In the transparency window of silicon the detection limit becomes almost independent on the filling fraction, while in the visible, the detection limit depends strongly on the filling fraction because silicon absorbs strongly.",Human
"A R&D project has been launched in 2009 to address fundamental methods in radiation transport simulation and revisit Geant4 kernel design to cope with new experimental requirements. The project focuses on simulation at different scales in the same experimental environment: this set of problems requires new methods across the current boundaries of condensed-random-walk and discrete transport schemes. An exploration is also foreseen about exploiting and extending already existing Geant4 features to apply Monte Carlo and deterministic transport methods in the same simulation environment. An overview of this new R&D associated with Geant4 is presented, together with the first developments in progress.",Human
"Laser control of ultrafast double proton transfer is investigated for a two-dimensional model system describing stepwise and concerted transfer pathways. The pulse design has been done by employing optimal control theory in combination with the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree wave packet propagation. The obtained laser fields correspond to multiple pump-dump pulse sequences. Special emphasis is paid to the relative importance of stepwise and concerted transfer pathways for the driven wave packet and its dependence on the parameters of the model Hamiltonian as well as on the propagation time. While stepwise transfer is dominating in all cases considered, for high barrier systems concerted transfer proceeding via tunneling can make a contribution.",Human
"Paradoxes are a relatively frequent occurrence in physics. The nature of their genesis is diverse and they are found in all branches of physics. There are a number of general and special classifications of paradoxes, but there are no classifications of paradoxes in physics. Nowadays, physics is a fundamental and rather formalized science, the paradoxes of which imply falsity and imprecision. One of the basic methods of addressing a problem is to present classifications that facilitate its formulation and study. This work groups together the paradoxes in physics according to certain common characteristics, which should assist in explaining the causes for paradox formation.",Human
"It is generally believed that transformation optics based cloaking, besides rendering the cloaked region invisible to detection by scattering of incident waves, also shields the region from those same waves. We demonstrate a coupling between the cloaked and uncloaked regions, exposing a difference between cloaking for rays and waves. Interior resonances allow this coupling to be amplified, and careful choice of parameters leads to effective cloaks with degraded shielding. As one application, we describe how to use transformation optics to hide sensors in the cloaked region and yet enable the sensors to efficiently measure waves incident on the exterior of the cloak, an effect similar to the plasmon based approach of Alu' and Engheta.",Human
"Cooperative spontaneous emission of a single photon from a cloud of N atoms modifies substantially the radiation pressure exerted by a far-detuned laser beam exciting the atoms. On one hand, the force induced by photon absorption depends on the collective decay rate of the excited atomic state. On the other hand, directional spontaneous emission counteracts the recoil induced by the absorption. We derive an analytical expression for the radiation pressure in steady-state. For a smooth extended atomic distribution we show that the radiation pressure depends on the atom number via cooperative scattering and that, for certain atom numbers, it can be suppressed or enhanced.",Human
The performance of prototypes for the ALICE electromagnetic sampling calorimeter has been studied in test beam measurements at FNAL and CERN. A $4\times4$ array of final design modules showed an energy resolution of about 11% /$\sqrt{E(\mathrm{GeV})}$ $\oplus$ 1.7 % with a uniformity of the response to electrons of 1% and a good linearity in the energy range from 10 to 100 GeV. The electromagnetic shower position resolution was found to be described by 1.5 mm $\oplus$ 5.3 mm /$\sqrt{E \mathrm{(GeV)}}$. For an electron identification efficiency of 90% a hadron rejection factor of $>600$ was obtained.,Human
"Optical antennas link objects to light. Here, we analyze metal nanorod antennas as cavities with variable reflection coefficients to derive the interaction of dipolar transitions with radiation through the antenna modes. The presented analytical model accurately describes the complete emission process, and is summarized in a phase-matching equation. We show how antenna modes evolve as they become increasingly more bound, i.e. plasmonic. The results illustrate why efficient antennas should not be too plasmonic, and how subradiant even modes can evolve into weakly-interacting dark modes. Our description is valid for the interaction of nanorods with light in general, and is thus widely applicable.",Human
"We propose a method of controlling two-atom interaction using both magnetic and laser fields. We analyse the role of quantum interference between magnetic and optical Feshbach resonances in controlling cold collision. In particular, we demonstrate that this method allows us to suppress inelastic and enhance elastic scattering cross sections. Quantum interference is shown to modify significantly the threshold behaviour and resonant interaction of ultracold atoms. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to manipulate not only the spherically symmetric s-wave interaction but also the anisotropic higher partial-wave interactions which are particularly important for high temperature superfluid or superconducting phases of matter.",Human
"We theoretically investigate the heating rate and spin flip lifetimes due to near field noise for atoms trapped close to layered superconducting structures. In particular, we compare the case of a gold layer deposited above a superconductor with the case of a bare superconductor. We study a niobium-based and a YBCO-based chip. For both niobium and YBCO chips at a temperature of 4.2 K, we find that the deposition of the gold layer can have a significant impact on the heating rate and spin flip lifetime, as a result of the increase of the near field noise. At a chip temperature of 77 K, this effect is less pronounced for the YBCO chip.",Human
"Scientific studies often require the precise calculation of derivatives. In many cases an analytical calculation is not feasible and one resorts to evaluating derivatives numerically. These are error-prone, especially for higher-order derivatives. A technique based on algorithmic differentiation is presented which allows for a precise calculation of higher-order derivatives. The method can be widely applied even for the case of only numerically solvable, implicit dependencies which totally hamper a semi-analytical calculation of the derivatives. As a demonstration the method is applied to a quantum field theoretical physical model. The results are compared with standard numerical derivative methods.",Human
"Basic aspects of phononless resonant capture of monoenergetic electron antineutrinos (Moessbauer antineutrinos) emitted in boundstate beta-decay in the 3H - 3He system are considered. It is shown that stochastic magnetic relaxation phenomena as well as the direct influence of solid-state effects on the energy of the electron antineutrino will cause line broadening by a factor of more than 10^(13). Lattice expansion and contraction after the transformation of the nucleus will drastically reduce the probability for phononless transitions. Thus, the observation of Moessbauer electron antineutrinos of the 3H - 3He system will most probably be unsuccessful. As a possible alternative, the Rare-Earth system 163Ho - 163Dy is briefly discussed.",Human
"We present a scheme for obtaining stable Casimir suspension of dielectric nontouching objects immersed in a fluid, validated here in various geometries consisting of ethanol-separated dielectric spheres and semi-infinite slabs. Stability is induced by the dispersion properties of real dielectric (monolithic) materials. A consequence of this effect is the possibility of stable configurations (clusters) of compact objects, which we illustrate via a ""molecular"" two-sphere dicluster geometry consiting of two bound spheres levitated above a gold slab. Our calculations also reveal a strong interplay between material and geometric dispersion, and this is exemplified by the qualitatively different stability behavior observed in planar versus spherical geometries.",Human
"We report the testing of a charcoal-based Kr-83m source for use in calibrating a low background two-phase liquid xenon detector. Kr-83m atoms produced through the decay of Rb-83 are introduced into a xenon detector by flowing xenon gas past the Rb-83 source. 9.4 keV and 32.1 keV transitions from decaying 83Krm nuclei are detected through liquid xenon scintillation and ionization. The characteristics of the Kr-83m source are analyzed and shown to be appropriate for a low background liquid xenon detector. Introduction of Kr-83m allows for quick, periodic calibration of low background noble liquid detectors at low energy.",Human
"We demonstrate for the first time and unexpectedly that the Principle of Relativity dictates the choice of the ""gauge conditions"" in the canonical example of a Gauge Theory namely Classical Electromagnetism. All the known ""gauge conditions"" of the literature are interpreted physically as electromagnetic continuity equations hence the ""gauge fields"". The existence of a Galilean Electromagnetism with TWO dual limits (""electric"" and ""magnetic"") is the crux of the problem [1]. A phase-space with the domains of validity of the various ""gauge conditions"" is provided and is shown to depend on three characteristic times : the magnetic diffusion time, the charge relaxation time and the transit time of electromagnetic waves in a continuous medium [2].",Human
"Macroscale experiments show that a train of two immiscible liquid drops, a bislug, can spontaneously move in a capillary tube because of surface tension asymmetries. We use molecular dynamics simulation of Lennard-Jones fluids to demonstrate this phenomenon for NVT ensembles in sub-micron tubes. We deliberately tune the strength of intermolecular forces and control the velocity of bislug in different wetting and viscosity conditions. We compute the velocity profile of particles across the tube, and explain the origin of deviations from the classical parabolae. We show that the self-generated molecular flow resembles the Poiseuille law when the ratio of the tube radius to its length is less than a critical value.",Human
"A dark matter model which is called w-matter or mirror dark matter is concretely constructed based on (f-SU(5))X(w-SU(5)) symmetry. There is no Higgs field and all masses originate from interactions in the present model. W-matter is dark matter relatively to f-matter and vice versa. In high-energy processes or when temperature is very high, visible matter and dark matter can transform from one into another. In such process energy seems to be non-conservational, because dark matter cannot be detected. In low-energy processes or when temperature is low, there is only gravitation interaction of dark matter for visible matter.",Human
"The formation of one-dimensional carbon chains from graphene nanoribbons is investigated using it ab initio molecular dynamics. We show under what conditions it is possible to obtain a linear atomic chain via pulling of the graphene nanoribbons. The presence of dimers composed of two-coordinated carbon atoms at the edge of the ribbons is necessary for the formation of the linear chains, otherwise there is simply the full rupture of the structure. The presence of Stone-Wales defects close to these dimers may lead to the formation of longer chains. The local atomic configuration of the suspended atoms indicates the formation of single and triple bonds, which is a characteristic of polyynes.",Human
"We analyze the dynamics toward cultural consensus in the Axelrod model on scale-free networks. By looking at the microscopic dynamics of the model, we are able to show how culture traits spread across different cultural features. We compare the diffusion at the level of cultural features to the growth of cultural consensus at the global level, finding important differences between these two processes. In particular, we show that even when most of the cultural features have reached macroscopic consensus, there are still no signals of globalization. Finally, we analyze the topology of consensus clusters both for global culture and at the feature level of representation.",Human
"Incident angle dependence of reactions between graphene and hydrogen atoms are obtained qualitatively by classical molecular dynamics simulation under the NVE condition with modified Brenner reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential. Chemical reaction depends on two parameters, i.e., polar angle $\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$ of the incident hydrogen. From the simulation results, it is found that the reaction rates strongly depend on polar angle $\theta$. Reflection rate becomes larger with increasing $\theta$, and the $\theta$ dependence of adsorption rate is also found. The $\theta$ dependence is caused by three dimensional structure of the small potential barrier which covers adsorption sites. $\phi$ dependence of penetration rate is also found for large $\theta$.",Human
"Magnetic Faraday rotation is widely used in optics and MW. In uniform magneto-optical materials, this effect is very weak. One way to enhance it is to incorporate the magnetic material into a high-Q optical resonator. One problem with magneto-optical resonators is that along with Faraday rotation, the absorption and linear birefringence can also increase dramatically, compromising the device performance. Another problem is strong ellipticity of the output light. We discuss how the above problems can be addressed in the cases of optical microcavities and a slow wave resonators. We show that a slow wave resonator has a fundamental advantage when it comes to Faraday rotation enhancement in lossy magnetic materials.",Human
"In this paper, we present an interesting method to microfabricate a tilted micro air jet generator. We used the well-know deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) technique in order to realize in a silicon substrate a double side etching. For aircraft and cars, micro air jets will take an important place for fluid control. Micro air jets are characterized by their speed, frequency and tilt. Usually, this micro air jets are produced by fluidic microsystems. We presented experimental results about micro tilted air jets. A comparison between finite element method simulation, theory and experimental results are performed to define the microsystem geometry leading a specific air jet angle.",Human
"In this and subsequent paper arXiv:1011.5185 we develop a recursive approach for calculating the short-time expansion of the propagator for a general quantum system in a time-dependent potential to orders that have not yet been accessible before. To this end the propagator is expressed in terms of a discretized effective potential, for which we derive and analytically solve a set of efficient recursion relations. Such a discretized effective potential can be used to substantially speed up numerical Monte Carlo simulations for path integrals, or to set up various analytic approximation techniques to study properties of quantum systems in time-dependent potentials. The analytically derived results are numerically verified by treating several simple models.",Human
"Uranium and thorium are the main heat producing elements in the earth. Their quantities and distributions, which specify the flux of detectable antineutrinos generated by the beta decay of their daughter isotopes, remain unmeasured. Geological models of the continental crust and the mantle predict different quantities and distributions of uranium and thorium. Many of these differences are resolvable with precision measurements of the terrestrial antineutrino flux. This precision depends on both statistical and systematic uncertainties. An unavoidable background of antineutrinos from nuclear reactors typically dominates the systematic uncertainty. This report explores in detail the capability of various operating and proposed geo-neutrino detectors for testing geological models.",Human
"The ArDM experiment, a 1 ton liquid argon TPC/Calorimeter, is designed for the detection of dark matter particles which can scatter off the spinless argon nucleus, producing nuclear recoils. These events will be discerned by their light to charge ratio, as well as the time structure of the scintillation light. The experiment is presently under construction and commissioning on surface at CERN. Cryogenic operation and light detection performance was recently confirmed in a test run of the full 1 ton liquid argon target under purely calorimetric operation and with a prototype light readout system. This note describes the experimental concept, the main detector components and presents some first results.",Human
"Detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the expected radioactive background rates and spectra in NaI crystals are presented. The obtained spectra are then compared to those measured in the DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA experiments. The simulations can be made consistent with the measured DAMA spectrum only by assuming higher than reported concentrations of some isotopes and even so leave very little room for the dark matter signal. We conclude that any interpretation of the annual modulation of the event rate observed by DAMA as a dark matter signal, should include full consideration of the background spectrum. This would significantly restrict the range of dark matter models capable of explaining the modulation effect.",Human
"A succinct statement and justification of all the principles necessary to understand and evaluate interpretations of quantum mechanics is given. These principles provide strong constraints on interpretations. They imply the particle-like properties of mass, energy, momentum, spin, charge, and locality are actually properties of the wave function, and this in turn implies there is no evidence for the existence of particles. In addition, there is currently no experimental evidence for collapse, and a theory of collapse encounters significant hurdles. Further, the probability law is found to rule out the many-worlds interpretation, so all three major interpretations encounter serious to fatal problems. An interpretation which conforms to all the principles is given.",Human
"We present the first of a two-part Mathematica notebook collection that implements a symbolic approach for the application of the density matrix expansion (DME) to the Hartree-Fock (HF) energy from a chiral effective field theory (EFT) three-nucleon interaction at N$^2$LO. The final output from the notebooks is a Skyrme-like energy density functional that provides a quasi-local approximation to the nonlocal HF energy. In this paper, we discuss the derivation of the HF energy and its simplification in terms of the scalar/vector-isoscalar/isovector parts of the one-body density matrix. Furthermore, a set of steps is described and illustrated on how to extend the approach to other three-nucleon interactions.",Human
"Short laser pulse in wide range of wavelengths, from infrared to X-ray, disturbs electron-ion equilibrium and rises pressure in a heated layer. The case where pulse duration $\tau_L$ is shorter than acoustic relaxation time $t_s$ is considered in the paper. It is shown that this short pulse may cause thermomechanical phenomena such as spallative ablation regardless to wavelength. While the physics of electron-ion relaxation on wavelength and various electron spectra of substances: there are spectra with an energy gap in semiconductors and dielectrics opposed to gapless continuous spectra in metals. The paper describes entire sequence of thermomechanical processes from expansion, nucleation, foaming, and nanostructuring to spallation with particular attention to spallation by X-ray pulse.",Human
"The nonlinear properties of quasiperiodic photonic crystals based on the Thue-Morse sequence are investigated. The intrinsic spatial asymmetry of these one-dimensional structures for odd generation numbers results in bistability thresholds which are sensitive to the propagation direction. Along with resonances of perfect transmission, this feature allows to achieve strongly non-reciprocal propagation and to create an all-optical diode. The salient qualitative features of such optical diode action is readily explained through a simple coupled resonator model. The efficiency of a passive scheme, which does not necessitate of an additional short pump signal, is compared to an active scheme, where such a signal is required.",Human
"In a previous study it was demonstrated that Dirac's relativistic quantum equation for free electrons (DRQM)can be obtained from Maxwell's classical electromagnetic field equations (MaxEq). This raises fundamental issues about the demarcation between the classical and quantum domain and about spin. In the present study it is assumed, however, that the derivation is physically relevant to cases where it is difficult to distinguish between classical and quantum physics. The possibility of operating gauges on electron level is studied in view of the effect on the larger physical scale which provides a means to give experimental support to the presented pre-1900 history challenge.",Human
"Schroedinger's equation with the attractive potential   V(r) = -Z/(r^q+ b^q)^(1/q), Z > 0, b > 0, q >= 1, is shown, for general values of the parameters Z and b, to be reducible to the confluent Heun equation in the case q=1, and to the generalized Heun equation in case q=2. In a formulation with correct asymptotics, the eigenstates are specified a priori up to an unknown factor. In certain special cases this factor becomes a polynomial. The Asymptotic Iteration Method is used either to find the polynomial factor and the associated eigenvalue explicitly, or to construct accurate approximations for them. Detail solutions for both cases are provided.",Human
"We survey the most important results and some recent developments about the secure key exchange protocol where the security is based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the robustness of classical physical information. We conclude that a classical physical system offers a higher level of control and security during the communication. We also mention some recent attempts inspired by this communicator to create other systems where Alice and Bob do not form an organic single system and/or the Second Law is irrelevant. It seems philosophically that they cannot be unconditionally secure, however it is yet an open question how to crack them; how can they be best used for conditionally secure communications, and what are the practical implications.",Human
"A new type of resonant light absorption by a small particle (nanocluster) is reported. The problem cannot be described within the commonly used dipole scattering approximation and should be studied with methods based upon the exact Mie solution. It is shown that the absorption cross-section has giant maxima realized at small values of the imaginary part of the complex dielectric permittivity of the particle. The maxima are situated in the vicinity of the plasmon (polariton) resonances and correspond to the regions where the dissipative damping equals the radiative one. The case is similar to the recently introduced anomalous scattering [PRL vol. 97, 263902 (2006)] and exhibits similar peculiarities.",Human
"We study wave transmission through one-dimensional random nonlinear structures and predict a novel effect resulting from an interplay of nonlinearity and disorder. We reveal that, while weak nonlinearity does not change the typical exponentially small transmission in the regime of the Anderson localization, it affects dramatically the disorder-induced localized states excited inside the medium leading to {\em bistable} and {\em nonreciprocal} resonant transmission. Our numerical modelling shows an excellent agreement with theoretical predictions based on the concept of a high-Q resonator associated with each localized state. This offers a new way of all-optical light control employing statistically-homogeneous random media without regular cavities.",Human
"The aim of this paper is to present the analysis of influence of defects in 1D photonic crystal (PC) on the density of states and simultaneously spontaneous emission, in both spatial and frequency domains. In our investigations we use an analytic model of 1D PC with defects. Our analysis reveals how presence of a defect causes a defect mode to appear. We show that a defect in 1D PC has local character, being negligible in regions of PC situated far from the defected elementary cell. We also analyze the effect of multiple defects, which lead to photonic band gap splitting.",Human
"We demonstrate for the first time natural phase matching for optical frequency doubling in a high-Q whispering gallery mode resonator made of Lithium Niobate. A conversion efficiency of 9% is achieved at 30 micro Watt in-coupled continuous wave pump power. The observed saturation pump power of 3.2 mW is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art. This suggests an application of our frequency doubler as a source of non-classical light requiring only a low-power pump, which easily can be quantum noise limited. Our theoretical analysis of the three-wave mixing in a whispering gallery mode resonator provides the relative conversion efficiencies for frequency doubling in various modes.",Human
"We present a novel approach to visually locate bodies of research within the sciences, both at each moment of time and dynamically. This article describes how this approach fits with other efforts to locally and globally map scientific outputs. We then show how these science overlay maps help benchmark, explore collaborations, and track temporal changes, using examples of universities, corporations, funding agencies, and research topics. We address conditions of application, with their advantages, downsides and limitations. Overlay maps especially help investigate the increasing number of scientific developments and organisations that do not fit within traditional disciplinary categories. We make these tools accessible to help researchers explore the ongoing socio-cognitive transformation of science and technology systems.",Human
"Genetically identical cells under the same environmental conditions can show strong variations in protein copy numbers due to inherently stochastic events in individual cells. We here develop a theoretical framework to address how variations in enzyme abundance affect the collective kinetics of metabolic reactions observed within a population of cells. Kinetic parameters measured at the cell population level are shown to be systematically deviated from those of single cells, even within populations of homogeneous parameters. Because of these considerations, Michaelis-Menten kinetics can even be inappropriate to apply at the population level. Our findings elucidate a novel origin of discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro kinetics, and offer potential utility for analysis of single-cell metabolomic data.",Human
"In this paper, Bohmian mechanics is introduced to the intense laser-atom physics. The motion of atomic electron in intense laser field is obtained from the Bohm-Newton equation. We find the quantum potential that dominates the quantum effect of a physical system becomes negligible as the electron is driven far away from the parent ion by the intense laser field, i.e. the behavior of the electron smoothly trends to be classical soon after the electron was ionized. Our numerical calculations present a direct positive evidence for the semiclassical trajectory methods in the intense laser-atom physics where the motion of the ionized electron is treated by the classical mechanics, while quantum mechanics is needed before the ionization.",Human
"To most physicists, quantum mechanics must embrace the imaginary number i = square root of minus one is at least a common belief if not a mystery. We use the famous example pq -qp = h/(2 pi i) to demonstrate the possible elimination of i when constructing this noncommutative relationship. We then discuss the role of i in the formulation of Schroedinger's wave equation. Common to the original development of these two quantum theories was the use of complex exponential to represent the fundamental variables (i.e., p, q, and the wave function). Understanding this complex function from the right perspective, as we suggest in this essay, removes the mysteries surrounding the complex nature of quantum mechanics.",Human
We have investigated the energy correlation of the two electrons from nonsequential double ionization of helium atom in 800 nm laser fields at intensities below the recollision threshold by quantum calculations. The circular arcs structure of the correlated electron momentum spectra reveals a resonant double ionization process in which the two electrons transit from doubly excited states into continuum states by simultaneously absorbing and sharing excess energy in integer units of the photon energy. Coulomb repulsion between the two electrons in continuum states is responsible for the dominant back-to-back electron emission and two intensity-independent cutoffs in the two-electron energy spectra.,Human
"In this work, we report electronic structure calculations aimed at computing the linear optical absorption spectrum, and static dipole polarizablity of a newly proposed boron-based planar aromatic compound borozene (B_12H_6$. For the purpose, we use the semiempirical INDO model Hamiltonian, accompanied by large-scale correlation calculations using the multi-reference singles-doubles configuration-interaction (MRSDCI) approach. We present detailed predictions about the energetics, polarization properties, and the nature of many-particle states contributing to various peaks in the linear absorption spectrum. Our results can be used to characterize this material in future optical absorption experiments. We also argue that one can deduce the aromaticity of the cluster from the optical absorption and static polarizability results.",Human
"It has recently been shown that the transmission of electromagnetic fields through sub-wavelength slits (parallel to the electric field direction) in a thin metallic screen can be greatly enhanced by covering one side of the screen with a metallic cut-wire array laid on a dielectric layer. In this Letter, we show that a richer phenomenology (which involves both electric- and magnetic-type resonances) can be attained by pairing a second cut-wire array at the other side of the screen. Via a full-wave comprehensive parametric study, we illustrate the underlying mechanisms and explore the additional degrees of freedom endowed, as well as their possible implications in the engineering of enhanced transmission phenomena.",Human
"High flux expansion divertor studies have been carried out in the National Spherical Torus Experiment using steady-state X-point height variations from 22 to 5-6 cm. Small-ELM H-mode confinement was maintained at all X-point heights. Divertor flux expansions from 6 to 26-28 were obtained, with associated reduction in X-point connection length from 5-6 m to 2 m. Peak divertor heat flux was reduced from 7-8 MW/m$^2$ to 1-2 MW/m$^2$. In low X-point configuration, outer strike point became nearly detached. Among factors affecting deposition of parallel heat flux in the divertor, the flux expansion factor appeared to be dominant",Human
"Large liquid argon (LAr) detectors, up to 100 kton scale, are presently being considered for proton decay searches and neutrino astrophysics as well as far detectors for the next generation of long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, aiming at neutrino mass hierarchy determination and CP violation searches in the leptonic sector. These detectors rely on the possibility of maintaining large LAr masses stably at cryogenic conditions with low thermal losses and of achieving long drifts of the ionization charge, so to minimize the number of readout channels per unit volume. Many R&D initiatives are being undertaken throughout the world, following somewhat different concepts for the final detector design, but with many common basic R&D issues.",Human
"The rheology of granular materials near an interface is investigated through proton magnetic resonance imaging. A new cylinder shear apparatus has been inserted in the MRI device, which allows the control of the radial confining pressure exerted by the outer wall on the grains and the measurement of the torque on the inner shearing cylinder. A multi-layer velocimetry sequence has been developed for the simultaneous measurement of velocity profiles in different sample zones, while the measurement of the solid fraction profile is based on static imaging of the sample. This study describes the influence of the roughness of the shearing interface and of the transverse confining walls on the granular interface rheology.",Human
"Biochemical computing is an emerging field of unconventional computing that attempts to process information with biomolecules and biological objects using digital logic. In this work we survey filtering in general, in biochemical computing, and summarize the experimental realization of an AND logic gate with sigmoid response in one of the inputs. The logic gate is realized with electrode-immobilized glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme that catalyzes a reaction corresponding to the Boolean AND functions. A kinetic model is also developed and used to evaluate the extent to which the performance of the experimentally realized logic gate is close to optimal.",Human
"In this work, we study the adhesion of multi-component vesicle membrane to both flat and curved substrates, based on the conventional Helfrich bending energy for multi-component vesicles and adhesion potentials of different forms. A phase field formulation is used to describe the different components of the vesicle. For the axisymmetric case, a number of representative equilibrium vesicle shapes are computed and some energy diagrams are presented which reveal the dependence of the calculated shapes and solution branches on various parameters including both bending moduli and spontaneous curvatures as well as the adhesion potential constants. Our computation also confirms a recent experimental observation that the adhesion effect may promote phase separation in two-component vesicle membranes.",Human
"So far, the Standard Model of Elementary Particles has not succeeded getting a trustworthy account of the proton spin, which remains an enigma. This hindrance is known as the proton spin crisis, owing to the experimental evidence already from 1988 suggesting that little or none of the proton spin would come from the spin of the quarks. This prompted theorists to a flood of guessworks about the proton spin. Since it remains unsolved, in the framework of new physics an exploratory approach based on a novel paradigm is proposed, which brings a renewed access to this challenge, through its reciprocal relationship with the g-factor.",Human
We study shallow moist Rayleigh-Benard convection in the Boussinesq approximation in three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. The thermodynamics of phase changes is approximated by a piecewise linear equation of state close to the phase boundary. The impact of phase changes on the turbulent fluctuations and the transfer of buoyancy through the layer is discussed as a function of the Rayleigh number and the ability to form liquid water. The enhanced buoyancy flux due to phase changes is compared with dry convection reference cases and related to the cloud cover in the convection layer. This study indicates that the moist Rayleigh-Benard problem offers a practical framework for the development and evaluation of parametrizations for atmospheric convection.,Human
"Within a semiclassical description of above-threshold ionization (ATI) we identify the interplay between intracycle and intercycle interferences. The former is imprinted as a modulation envelope on the discrete multiphoton peaks formed by the latter. This allows to unravel the complex interference pattern observed for the full solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation (TDSE) in terms of diffraction at a grating in the time domain. These modulations can be clearly seen in the dependence of the ATI spectra on the laser wavelength. Shifts in energy modulation result from the effect of the long Coulomb tail of the atomic potential.",Human
"The feasibility of a next generation neutrino observatory in Europe is being considered within the LAGUNA design study. To accommodate giant neutrino detectors and shield them from cosmic rays, a new very large underground infrastructure is required. Seven potential candidate sites in different parts of Europe and at several distances from CERN are being studied: Boulby (UK), Canfranc (Spain), Fr\'ejus (France/Italy), Pyh\""asalmi (Finland), Polkowice-Sieroszowice (Poland), Slanic (Romania) and Umbria (Italy). The design study aims at the comprehensive and coordinated technical assessment of each site, at a coherent cost estimation, and at a prioritization of the sites within the summer 2010.",Human
"A careful look at an allegedly well-known century-old concept reveals interesting aspects in it that have generally avoided recognition in literature. There are four different kinds of physical observables known or proclaimed as relativistic invariants under space-time rotations. Only observables in the first three categories are authentic invariants, whereas the single ""invariant"" - proper length - in the fourth category is actually not an invariant. The proper length has little is anything to do with proper distance which is a true invariant. On the other hand, proper distance, proper time, and rest mass have more in common than usually recognized, and particularly, mass - time analogy opens another view of the twin paradox.",Human
"We propose a method to control the thermal stability of a sapphire dielectric transducer made with two dielectric disks separated by a thin gap and resonating in the whispering gallery (WG) modes of the electromagnetic field. The simultaneous measurement of the frequencies of both a WGH mode and a WGE mode allows one to discriminate the frequency shifts due to gap variations from those due to temperature instability. A simple model, valid in quasi equilibrium conditions, describes the frequency shift of the two modes in terms of four tuning parameters. A procedure for the direct measurement of them is presented.",Human
"In this article, we study the thermalizability of a system consisting of two atoms in a circular, transversely harmonic waveguide in the multimode regime. While showing some signatures of the quantum-chaotic behavior, the system fails to reach a thermal equilibrium in a relaxation from an initial state, even when the interaction between the atoms is infinitely strong. We relate this phenomenon to the previously addressed unattainability of a complete quantum chaos in the Seba billiard [P. Seba, Phys. Rev. Lett., 64, 1855 (1990)], and we conjecture the absence of a complete thermalization to be a generic property of integrable quantum systems perturbed by a non-integrable but well localized perturbation.",Human
"When an electron probes another elementary particle Q, the wave function of the electron can be separated into two independent parts, the first part represents the electronic motion, the second part represents the electromagnetic field mode around the particle Q. In analogy with optical modes $TEM_{nlm}$ for a laser resonator, when the electromagnetic field around the particle Q forms into a mode, the quantum numbers of the mode satisfy the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula, these quantum numbers are recognized as the charge number, baryon number and strangeness number. The modes are used as a visual model to understand the abstract baryon number and strangeness number of hadrons.",Human
"Wavelets offer significant advantages for the analysis of problems in quantum mechanics. Because wavelets are localized in both time and frequency they avoid certain subtle but potentially fatal conceptual errors that can result from the use of plane wave or delta function decomposition. Morlet wavelets are particularly well-suited for this work: as Gaussians, they have a simple analytic form and they work well with Feynman path integrals. To take full advantage of Morlet wavelets we need an explicit form for the inverse Morlet transform and a manifestly covariant form for the four-dimensional Morlet wavelet. We supply both here.",Human
"Antal et al. [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{72}, 036121 (2005)] have studied the balance dynamics on the social networks. In this paper, based on the model proposed by Antal et al., we improve it and generalize the binary social networks to the ternary social networks. When the social networks get dynamically balanced, we obtain the distributions of each relation and the time needed for dynamic balance. Besides, we study the self-organized criticality on the ternary social networks based on our model. For the ternary social networks evolving to the sensitive state, any small disturbance may result in an avalanche. The occurrence of the avalanche satisfies the power-law form both spatially and temporally. Numerical results verify our theoretical expectations.",Human
"We demonstrate a new kind of optical spectrometer employing photonic crystal patterns to outcouple waveguided light from a transparent substrate. This spectrometer consists of an array of photonic crystal patterns, nanofabricated in a polymer on a glass substrate, combined with a camera. The camera captures an image of the light outcoupled from the patterned substrate; the array of patterns produces a spatially resolved map of intensities for different wavelength bands. The intensity map of the image is converted into a spectrum using the photonic crystal pattern response functions. We present a proof of concept by characterizing a white LED with our photonic crystal spectrometer.",Human
"We present an analysis on the geometrical place formed by the set of maxima of the trajectories of a projectile launched in a media with linear drag. Such a place, the locus of apexes, is written in term of the Lambert $W$ function in polar coordinates, confirming the special role played by this function in the problem. In order to characterize the locus, a study of its curvature is presented in two parameterizations, in terms of the launch angle and in the polar one. The angles of maximum curvature are compared with other important angles in the projectile problem. As an addendum, we find that the synchronous curve in this problem is a circle as in the drag-free case.",Human
We provide direct experimental evidence that the one-dimensional (1D) to two-dimensional (2D) zigzag transition in a Yukawa cluster exhibits power law behavior. Configurations of a six-particle dusty (complex) plasma confined in a biharmonic potential well are characterized as the well anisotropy is reduced. When the anisotropy is large the particles are in a 1D straight line configuration. As the anisotropy is decreased the cluster undergoes a zigzag transition to a 2D configuration. The measured dependence of cluster width on anisotropy is well described by a power law. A second transition from the zigzag to an elliptical configuration is also observed. The results are in very good agreement with a model for particles interacting through a Yukawa potential.,Human
"This review paper is devoted to a presentation of recent progress in wave turbulence. I first present the context and state of the art of this field of research both experimentally and theoretically. I then focus on the case of wave turbulence on the surface of a fluid, and I discuss the main results obtained by our group: caracterization of the gravity and capillary wave turbulence regimes, the first observation of intermittency in wave turbulence, the occurrence of strong fluctuations of injected power in the fluid, the observation of a pure capillary wave turbulence in low gravity environment and the observation of magnetic wave turbulence on the surface of a ferrofluid. Finally, open questions in wave turbulence are discussed.",Human
"Preparations for the anapole measurement in Fr indicate the possibility of performing a similar measurement in a chain of Rb. The sensitivity analysis based on a single nucleon model shows the potential for placing strong limits on the nucleon weak interaction parameters. There are values of the magnetic fields at much lower values than found before that are insensitive to first order changes in the field. The anapole moment effect in Rb corresponds to an equivalent electric field that is eighty times smaller than Fr, but the stability of the isotopes and the current performance of the dipole trap in the apparatus, presented here, are encouraging for pursuing the measurment.",Human
"In this article, the relationship between two well-accepted empirical propositions regarding the distribution of population in cities, namely, Gibrat's law and Zipf's law, are rigorously examined using the Chinese census data. Our findings are quite in contrast with the most of the previous studies performed exclusively for developed countries. This motivates us to build a general environment to explain the morphology of urban agglomerations both in developed and developing countries. A dynamic process of job creation generates a particular distribution for the urban agglomerations and introduction of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in this abstract environment shows that the empirical observations are in good agreement with the proposed model.",Human
"This paper studies the size distributions of urban agglomerations for India and China. We have estimated the scaling exponent for the Zipf's law with the Indian census data for the years of 1981-2001 and the Chinese census data for 1990 and 2000. Along with the biased linear fit estimate, the maximum likelihood estimate for the Pareto and Tsallis q-exponential distribution has been computed. For India, the scaling exponent is in the range of [1.88, 2.06] and for China, it is in the interval [1.82, 2.29]. The goodness-of-fit tests of the estimated distributions are performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.",Human
"Classical and quantum interference of light propagating in arrays of coupled waveguides and undergoing multiband optical Bloch oscillations (BOs) with negligible Zener tunneling is theoretically investigated. In particular, it is shown that Mach-Zehnder-like interference effects spontaneously arise in multiband BOs owing to beam splitting and subsequent beam recombination occurring in one BO cycle. As a noteworthy example of quantum interference, we discuss the doubling of interference fringes in photon counting rates for a correlated photon pair undergoing two-band BOs, a phenomenon analogous to the manifestation of the de Broglie wavelength of an entangled biphoton state observed in quantum Mach-Zehnder interferometry.",Human
"A rigorous quantum theory of atomic collisions in the presence of radio frequency (rf) magnetic fields is developed and applied to elucidate the effects of combined dc and rf magnetic fields on elastic scattering in ultracold collisions of Rb atoms. We show that rf fields can be used to induce Feshbach resonances, which can be tuned by varying the amplitude and frequency of the rf field. The rf-induced Feshbach resonances occur also in collisions of atoms in low-field-seeking states at moderate rf field strengths easily available in atom chip experiments, which opens up the world of tunable interactions to magnetically trappable atomic quantum gases.",Human
"We introduce an operational approach to the use of pulsating sources, located at spatial infinity, for defining a relativistic positioning and navigation system, based on the use of four-dimensional bases of null four-vectors, in flat spacetime. As a prototypical case, we show how pulsars can be used to define such a positioning system. The reception of the pulses for a set of different sources whose positions in the sky and periods are assumed to be known allows the determination of the user's coordinates and spacetime trajectory, in the reference frame where the sources are at rest. We describe our approach in flat Minkowski spacetime, and discuss the validity of this and other approximations we have considered.",Human
"In pinning control of complex networks, a tacit believing is that the system dynamics will be better controlled by pinning the large-degree nodes than the small-degree ones. Here, by changing the number of pinned nodes, we find that, when a significant fraction of the network nodes are pinned, pinning the small-degree nodes could generally have a higher performance than pinning the large-degree nodes. We demonstrate this interesting phenomenon on a variety of complex networks, and analyze the underlying mechanisms by the model of star networks. By changing the network properties, we also find that, comparing to densely connected homogeneous networks, the advantage of the small-degree pinning strategy is more distinct in sparsely connected heterogenous networks.",Human
"The radiofrequency quadrupole linear ion trap is a widely used device in physics and chemistry. When used for trapping of large ion clouds, the presence of anharmonic terms in the radiofrequency potential limits the total number of stored ions. In this paper, we have studied the anharmonic content of the trapping potential for different implementations of a quadrupole trap, searching for the geometry best suited for the trapping of large ion clouds. This is done by calculating the potential of a real trap using SIMION8.0, followed by a fit, which allows us to obtain the evolution of anharmonic terms for a large part of the inner volume of the trap.",Human
"In the CMS experiment, the non event data needed to set up the detector, or being produced by it, and needed to calibrate the physical responses of the detector itself are stored in ORACLE databases. The large amount of data to be stored, the number of clients involved and the performance requirements make the database system an essential service for the experiment to run. This note describes the CMS condition database architecture, the data-flow and PopCon, the tool built in order to populate the offline databases. Finally, the first experience obtained during the 2008 and 2009 cosmic data taking are presented.",Human
"The objective of the study is to assess the accuracy of a standard FDTD code in description of high-Q resonances such as whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) ones excited in circular dielectric resonators. To achieve the goal, we consider circular resonators excited by line currents and extract the data on FDTD accuracy from comparisons between the FDTD-solution and the exact one obtained by the Mie-series solutions. The near-field and far-field characteristics are studied for resonators of various sizes, made of quartz and silicon. Both E - and H - polarizations are considered. The computational error, i.e. a resonance frequency shift observed for the FDTD solution, is analyzed and compared for several WGMs having different Q-factors.",Human
"A major challenge for molecular modeling consists in optimizing the unlike interaction potentials. In many cases, combination rules are generally suboptimal when accurate predictions of properties like the mixture vapor pressure are needed. However, the well known Lorentz-Berthelot rule performs quite well and can be used as a starting point. If more accurate results are required, it is advisable to adjust the dispersive interaction energy parameter.   In the present study, mixture properties are explored for binary systems containing hydrogen bonding components. Furthermore, vapor-liquid interface cluster criteria and contact angles are discussed and remarks on computational details are given. Finally, a sterically accurate generic model for benzyl alcohol is introduced and evaluated.",Human
"A novel functional integral formulation of quantum mechanics for non-Lagrangian systems is presented. The new approach, which we call ""stringy quantization,"" is based solely on classical equations of motion and is free of any ambiguity arising from Lagrangian and/or Hamiltonian formulation of the theory. The functionality of the proposed method is demonstrated on several examples. Special attention is paid to the stringy quantization of systems with a general A-power friction force $-\kappa[\dot{q}]^A$. Results for $A = 1$ are compared with those obtained in the approaches by Caldirola-Kanai, Bateman and Kostin. Relations to the Caldeira-Leggett model and to the Feynman-Vernon approach are discussed as well.",Human
"A state coupling between the hydrostatic (volumetric) and deviatoric parts of the free energy is introduced in a damage mechanics model relevant for the quasi-brittle materials. It is shown that it describes the large dilatancy of concrete under compression and the different localization angles and damage levels in tension and compression. A simple isotropic description is used, although similar ideas can be extended to anisotropic damage. The model is identified with respect to tensile and compression tests and validated on bi-compression and bi-tension. Fully written in three dimensions under the framework of thermodynamics of irreversible processes, it allows further developments within a finite element code.",Human
We predict that stable mobile spatio-temporal solitons can exist in arrays of periodically curved optical waveguides. We find two-dimensional light bullets in one-dimensional arrays with harmonic waveguide bending and three-dimensional bullets in square lattices with helical waveguide bending using variational formalism. Stability of the light bullet solutions is confirmed by the direct numerical simulations which show that the light bullets can freely move across the curved arrays. This mobility property is a distinguishing characteristic compared to previously considered discrete light bullets which were trapped to a specific lattice site. These results suggest new possibilities for flexible spatio-temporal manipulation of optical pulses in photonic lattices.,Human
"This article presents a comprehensive study and design methodology of co-integrated oscillators for nano mass sensing application based on resonant Nano-Electro-Mechanical-System (NEMS). In particular, it reports the capacitive with the piezoresistive transduction schemes in terms of the overall sensor performance. The developed model is clearly in accordance with the general experimental observations obtained for NEMS-based mass detection. The piezoresistive devices are much sensitive (up to 10 zg/?Hz) than capacitive ones (close to 100 zg/?Hz) since they can work at higher frequency. Moreover, the high doped silicon piezoresistive gauge, which is of a great interest for very large scale integration displays similar theoretical resolution than the metallic gauge already used experimentally.",Human
"Laser-induced fluorescence excitation spectrum of NiS in the wavelength range of 450 - 560 nm has been recorded and analyzed. Thirty-five vibronic transition bands have been observed, 29 of which are reported for the first time. Rotational analyses indicated that all the observed bands can be attributable to the [Omega = 0] - X^3 Sigma^- transitions of ^58 NiS (and ^60 NiS). Twenty-five bands have been suggested to be grouped into four vibrational progressions. Furthermore, through dispersed fluorescence measurements we directly obtained the energies for the ground-state vibrational levels up to v"" = 6 as well as the vibrational frequency and the anharmonicity constant for the ground state of ^58 NiS.",Human
Correlation between the lens extension size and the broadside directivity of a hemielliptic dielectric lens antenna (DLA) fed by a primary feed with variable radiation pattern is studied in accurate manner. The problem is considered in two-dimensional formulation and solved numerically using in-house software based on the Muller boundary integral equations. Our results highlight the key role of the edge taper which can be defined for DLAs similarly to the theory of reflector antennas. A new feature revealed is the relation between the optimal edge taper needed to achieve the highest possible directivity and the permittivity of the lens material.,Human
"The static equilibrium deformation of a heavy spring due to its own weight is calculated for two cases. First for a spring hanging in a constant gravitational field, then for a spring which is at rest in a rotating system where it is stretched by the centrifugal force. Two different models are considered. First a discrete model assuming a finite number of point masses connected by springs of negligible weight. Then the continuum limit of this model. In the second case the differential equation for the deformation is obtained by demanding that the potential energy is minimized. In this way a simple application of the variational calculus is obtained.",Human
"The underlying physics of neutrino oscillation in vacuum can be demonstrated by an optical analogical experiment. Two different neutrino flavors are represented by two polarization states of a laser beam, whereas the different phase propagation in vacuum is mimicked by the propagation difference of an ordinary and an extraordinary beam in a birefringent crystal. This allows us to demonstrate neutrino oscillation by optical methods in a fully microscopic way at the particle level. The description of both realizations of oscillation is also mathematically identical. In our demonstration experiment we can vary the oscillation parameters such as propagation length L and mixing angle Theta.",Human
"We consider evolution of multichannel excitations in longitudinally modulated waveguide arrays where refractive index either oscillates out-of-phase in all neighboring waveguides or when it is modulated in phase in several central waveguides surrounded by out-of-phase oscillating neighbors. Both types of modulations allow resonant inhibition of light tunneling, but only the modulation of latter type conserves the internal structure of multichannel excitations. We show that parameter regions where light tunneling inhibition is possible depend on the symmetry and structure of multichannel excitations. Antisymmetric multichannel excitations are more robust than their symmetric counterparts and experience nonlinearity-induced delocalization at higher amplitudes.",Human
"A random walk-like model is considered to discuss statistical aspects of tournaments. The model is applied to soccer leagues with emphasis on the scores. This competitive system was computationally simulated and the results are compared with empirical data from the English, the German and the Spanish leagues and showed a good agreement with them. The present approach enabled us to characterize a diffusion where the scores are not normally distributed, having a short and asymmetric tail extending towards more positive values. We argue that this non-Gaussian behavior is related with the difference between the teams and with the asymmetry of the scores system. In addition, we compared two tournament systems: the all-play-all and the elimination tournaments.",Human
"Three different evaluations of the energy dependence of the transmission-detection function of a two-stage cylindrical electron analyzer have been obtained by resorting to three established procedures. Their relative merits have been tested as follows. First they have been used to correct raw XPS spectra of clean Cu, Ag and Au surfaces. Next, the secondary electron background has been subtracted using Tougaard's method. Finally, the primary electron spectra so obtained have been reanalyzed by peak area measurement in the frame of the modern formalism for quantitative XPS analysis. Ideally a constant residual value should thus be obtained. The variability of these residuals with peak energy allows an objective rating of the initial transmission-detection functions.",Human
"Turbulent ship wake conservation at a long distance is one of unsolved problems at present. It is well known that wakes have a rotational structure and slowly expand with distance. Nevertheless, experimental data on their structure and properties are not sufficient. On the other hand, these experimental data show that the divergence of wakes does not change according to the law 1/5, as predicted by the theory. In our work we study the effect of helicity on the parameters of a turbulent ship wake. Taking into account the helical nature of the wake, we can clarify the difference between turbulence inside and outside of the wake on the one hand, and slow its expansion with time.",Human
"We present theoretical thermally-averaged rate constants for vibrational and rotational (de-)excitation of the H3+ ion by electron impact. The constants are calculated using the multi-channel quantum-defect approach. The calculation includes processes that involve a change Delta J<=2 in the rotational angular momentum J of H3+. The rate constants are calculated for states with J<=5 for rotational transitions of the H3+ ground vibrational level. The thermal rates for transitions among the lowest eight vibrational levels are also presented, averaged over the rotational structure of the vibrational levels. The conditions for producing non-thermal rotational and vibrational distributions of H3+ in astrophysical environments are discussed.",Human
"The impact of possible a-priori ""imprinting"" effects of general relativity itself on recent attempts to measure the Lense-Thirring precessions with the LAGEOS satellites orbiting the Earth and the terrestrial geopotential models by the dedicated mission GRACE is investigated. It is analytically shown that general relativity, not explicitly solved for in the GRACE-based models, may ""imprint"" their even zonal harmonic coefficients J_L at a non-negligible level, given the present-day accuracy in recovering them. This translates into a bias of the LAGEOS-based relativistic tests as large as the Lense-Thirring effect itself. Further analyses should include general relativity itself in the GRACE data processing by explicitly solving for it.",Human
"Attention is paid to the production mechanisms of light scalars that reveal their nature. We reveal the chiral shielding of the \sigma(600) meson. We show that the kaon loop mechanism of the \phi radiative decays, ratified by experiment, points to the four-quark nature of light scalars. We show also that the light scalars are produced in the two photon collisions via four-quark transitions in contrast to the classic P wave tensor q\bar q mesons that are produced via two-quark transitions $\gamma\gamma\to q\bar q$. The history of spontaneous breaking of symmetry in quantum physics is discussed in Appendix.",Human
"At any time, there are areas of science where we are standing at the frontier of knowledge, and can wonder whether we have reached a fundamental limit to human understanding. What is ultimately possible in physics? I will argue here that it is ultimately impossible to answer this question. For this, I will first distinguish three different reasons why the possibility of progress is doubted and offer examples for these cases. Based on this, one can then identify three reasons for why progress might indeed be impossible, and finally conclude that it is impossible to decide which case we are facing.",Human
"Non-contact interaction between two parallel flat surfaces is a central paradigm in sciences. This situation is the starting point for a wealth of different models: the capacitor description in electrostatics, hydrodynamic flow, thermal exchange, the Casimir force, direct contact study, third body confinement such as liquids or films of soft condensed matter. The control of parallelism is so demanding that no versatile single force machine in this geometry has been proposed so far. Using a combination of nanopositioning based on inertial motors and microcrystal shaping with Focused Ion Beams (FIB) we propose here an experimental set up that should enable one to measure interactions between movable surfaces separated by gaps in the micrometer and the nanometer ranges.",Human
"Classical Taylor-Aris dispersion theory is extended to describe the transport of suspensions of self-propelled dipolar cells in a tubular flow. General expressions for the mean drift and effective diffusivity are determined exactly in terms of axial moments, and compared with an approximation a la Taylor. As in the Taylor-Aris case, the skewness of a finite distribution of biased swimming cells vanishes at long times. The general expressions can be applied to particular models of swimming microorganisms, and thus be used to predict swimming drift and diffusion in tubular bioreactors, and to elucidate competing unbounded swimming drift and diffusion descriptions. Here, specific examples are presented for gyrotactic swimming algae.",Human
"We report line-by-line control of a coherent discrete spectrum (Raman sidebands) with a frequency spacing of 10.6 THz that is produced by an adiabatic Raman process. We show that the spectral phase of the Raman sidebands is finely controlled to the target (flat relative-spectral-phase). This is achieved by employing a combination of a spatial phase controller and a spectral interferometer, which are specifically designed for a high-power discrete spectrum. We also show that such spectral-phase control produces a train of Fourier transform limited pulses with an ultrahigh repetition rate of 10.6 THz in the time domain.",Human
"We analyze the dynamics of growth of the number of congressmen supporting the resolution HR1207 to audit the Federal Reserve. The plot of the total number of co-sponsors as a function of time is of ""Devil's staircase"" type. The distribution of the numbers of new co-sponsors joining during a particular day (step height) follows a power law. The distribution of the length of intervals between additions of new co-sponsors (step length) also follows a power law. We use a modification of Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model to simulate the dynamics of Congress and obtain a good agreement with the data.",Human
"We present experimental evidence that a bubble moving in a fluid in which a well-chosen acoustic noise is superimposed can be significantly slowed down for moderate acoustic pressures. Through mean velocity measurements, we show that a condition for this effect to occur is for the acoustic noise spectrum to match or overlap the bubble's fundamental resonant mode. By rendering the bubble's oscillations and translational movements using high speed video, we evidence that radial oscillations have no effect on the mean velocity, while above a critical sound pressure threshold, Faraday waves are triggered and are responsible for the bubble's drag increase.",Human
Optical properties of planar thin film metamaterials were measured at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The operation of metamaterials at cryogenic temperatures is anticipated to be a promising path towards low-loss metamaterials since nonradiative losses are strongly suppressed due to higher charge mobility. A 14% increase in the quality factor of the resonances was experimentally observed. It was limited by the high electron scattering rate due to defects in thin films. Supplementary simulations assuming metamaterials made of thick films reveal a temperature controlled behaviour and a 40% increase of the Q-factor at 10 K.,Human
"Many types of cells can sense external ligand concentrations with cell-surface receptors at extremely high accuracy. Interestingly, ligand-bound receptors are often internalized, a process also known as receptor-mediated endocytosis. While internalization is involved in a vast number of important functions for the life of a cell, it was recently also suggested to increase the accuracy of sensing ligand as the overcounting of the same ligand molecules is reduced. Here we show, by extending simple ligand-receptor models to out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics, that internalization increases the accuracy with which cells can measure ligand concentrations in the external environment. Comparison with experimental rates of real receptors demonstrates that our model has indeed biological significance.",Human
"A model for epidemic spreading on rewiring networks is introduced and analyzed for the case of scale free steady state networks. It is found that contrary to what one would have naively expected, the rewiring process typically tends to suppress epidemic spreading. In particular it is found that as in static networks, rewiring networks with degree distribution exponent $\gamma >3$ exhibit a threshold in the infection rate below which epidemics die out in the steady state. However the threshold is higher in the rewiring case. For $2<\gamma \leq 3$ no such threshold exists, but for small infection rate the steady state density of infected nodes (prevalence) is smaller for rewiring networks.",Human
"The radiative self-energy correction to the bound-electron g factor of 2P_1/2 and 2P_3/2 states in one-electron ions is evaluated to order alpha (Z alpha)^2. The contribution of high-energy virtual photons is treated by means of an effective Dirac equation, and the result is verified by an approach based on long-wavelength quantum electrodynamics. The contribution of low-energy virtual photons is calculated both in the velocity and in the length gauge and gauge invariance is verified explicitly. The results compare favorably to recently available numerical data for hydrogenlike systems with low nuclear charge numbers.",Human
"It has been more than a century since first Lorentz and later Einstein explored relativistic events and still important consequences of that remains unclear to everybody. The present study extensively focus on Lorentz (Length) contraction phenomenon and takes a different approaches to explain how the shrinking of the body appears if exists. We utilized two postulates of Special Relativity that emphasizes constancy of speed of light and same physical laws in any inertial frame. Finally, we propose Lorentz contraction exists in different form through the shape of the accelerated body. The deformation of its shape depends on the part where it is measured.",Human
"We study the relationship between dynamical properties and interaction patterns in complex oscillator networks in the presence of noise. A striking finding is that noise leads to a general, one-to-one correspondence between the dynamical correlation and the connections among oscillators for a variety of node dynamics and network structures. The universal finding enables an accurate prediction of the full network topology based solely on measuring the dynamical correlation. The power of the method for network inference is demonstrated by the high success rate in identifying links for distinct dynamics on both model and real-life networks. The method can have potential applications in various fields due to its generality, high accuracy and efficiency.",Human
"We analyse the Anderson-Higgs mechanism of photon mass acquisition in a plasma and study the contribution to the mass from the orbital angular momentum acquired by a beam of photons when it crosses a spatially structured charge distribution. To this end we apply Proca-Maxwell equations in a static plasma with a particular spatial distribution of free charges, notably a plasma vortex, that is able to impose orbital angular momentum (OAM) onto light. In addition to the mass acquisition of the conventional Anderson-Higgs mechanism, we find that the photon acquires an additional mass from the OAM and that this mass reduces the Proca photon mass.",Human
"Among various plasmonic waveguides, the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) type is the most promising for true subwavelength photonic integration. To date, many photonic devices based on MIM waveguides have been investigated, including resonators. However, most of the reported MIM ring resonators suffer from low extinction ratios. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic reasons for the low performance of MIM ring resonators, and give the analytical transmission relation for a universal all-pass ring resonator which has coupling loss. Based on the analysis we propose the plasmonic racetrack resonators in MIM waveguides and show that the performance can be greatly improved.",Human
"Sport sciences researchers talk about a relative age effect when they observe a biased distribution of elite athletes' birthdates, with an over-representation of those born at the beginning of the competitive year and an under-representation of those born at the end. Using the whole sample of the French male licensed soccer players (n = 1,831,524), our study suggests that there could be an important bias in the statistical test of this effect. This bias could in turn lead to falsely conclude to a systemic discrimination in the recruitment of professional players. Our findings question the accuracy of past results concerning the existence of this effect at the elite level.",Human
"We consider general theoretical models of water and in particular the nature of the motions of the hydrogen nuclei. If the motion of hydrogen nuclei is classical, then the thermodynamic pressure equation of state for heavy water wherein the hydrogen nuclei are deuterons is identical to the pressure equation of state for light water wherein the hydrogen nuclei are protons. Since the experimental thermodynamic phase diagram for light water is clearly measurably different from the experimental thermodynamic phase diagram for heavy water, one may deduce that the motions of hydrogen nuclei are quantum mechanical in nature. This conclusion is in physical agreement with a recent analysis of X-ray, neutron and deep inelastic neutron scattering data.",Human
"The method of Taylor series expansion is used to develop a numerical solution to the reactor point kinetics equations. It is shown that taking a first order expansion of the neutron density and precursor concentrations at each time step gives results that are comparable to those obtained using other popular and more complicated methods. The algorithm developed using a Taylor series expansion is simple, completely transparent, and highly accurate. The procedure is tested using a variety of initial conditions and input data, including step reactivity, ramp reactivity, sinusoidal, and zigzag reactivity. These results are compared to those obtained using other methods.",Human
"The behavior of a 2-D model of an extended hemielliptic silicon lens of a size typical for THz applications is accurately studied for the case of a plane E-wave illumination. The full-wave analysis of the scattering problem is based on the Muller boundary integral equations that are uniquely solvable. Galerkin discretization scheme with a trigonometric basis leads to a very efficient numerical algorithm. Numerical results related to the focusability of the lens versus its rear-side extension and the angle of the plane-wave incidence, as well as near-field profiles, demonstrate strong resonances. Such effects can change the principles of optimal design of lens-based receivers.",Human
"The objective of the paper is the assessment of the accuracy of a conventional FDTD code in the computation of the near and far-field scattering characteristics of a circular dielectric cylinder. We excite the cylinder with an electric or magnetic line current and demonstrate the failure of the two-dimensional FDTD algorithm to characterize accurately the emission rate and the field patterns near high-Q whispering-gallery-mode resonances. This is proven by comparison with the exact series solutions. The computational errors in the emission rate are then studied at the resonances still detectable with FDTD, i.e. having Q-factors up to 10^3.",Human
"We have introduced excluded volume effect, which is an important factor to model a realistic pedestrian queue, into queueing theory. The probability distributions of pedestrian number and pedestrian waiting time in a queue have been calculated exactly. Due to time needed to close up the queue, the mean number of pedestrians increases as pedestrian arrival probability ($\lambda$) and leaving probability ($\mu$) increase even if the ratio between them (i.e., $\rho=\lambda/\mu$) remains constant. Furthermore, at a given $\rho$, the mean waiting time does not increase monotonically with the service time (which is inverse to $\mu$), a minimum could be reached instead.",Human
"We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that high-numerical-aperture (NA) optical microscopy is accompanied by strong spin-orbit interaction of light, which translates fine infomation about the specimen to the polarization degrees of freedom of light. An 80nm gold nano-particle scattering the light in the focus of a high-NA objective generates angular momentum conversion which is seen as a non-uniform polarization distribution at the exit pupil. We demonstrate remarkable sensitivity of the effect to the position of the nano-particle: Its subwavelength displacement produces the giant spin-Hall effect, i.e., macro-separation of spins in the outgoing light. This brings forth a far-field optical nanoprobing technique based on the spin-orbit interaction of light.",Human
"In a Forum published in EOS Transactions AGU (2009) entitled ""Lies, damned lies and statistics (in Geology)"", Vermeesch (2009) claims that ""statistical significant is not the same as geological significant"", in other words, statistical tests may be misleading. In complete contradiction, we affirm that statistical tests are always informative. We detail the several mistakes of Vermeesch in his initial paper and in his comments to our reply. The present text is developed in the hope that it can serve as an illuminating pedagogical exercise for students and lecturers to learn more about the subtleties, richness and power of the science of statistics.",Human
"We propose a simple three-body model of an atom in which one electron on a circular Rydberg orbit is treated as an independent particle and the remaining core electrons are collectively described as a single object. Within this model we predict the existence of stable deformed states of atoms. The deformation is generated by a bootstrap mechanism. The atomic core is polarized by the excited electron and the induced dipole moment keeps this electron localized. The deformed stable states of the atom are similar to the Trojan states observed in recent experiments. However, in the present case the breaking of the rotational symmetry does not require the presence of external fields.",Human
"As science technology grows, medical application is becoming more complex to solve the physiological problems within expected time. Workflow management systems (WMS) in Grid computing are promising solution to solve the sophisticated problem such as genomic analysis, drug discovery, disease identification, etc. Although existing WMS can provide basic management functionality in Grid environment, consideration of user requirements such as performance, reliability and interaction with user is missing. In this paper, we propose hybrid workflow management system for heart disease identification and discuss how to guarantee different user requirements according to user SLA. The proposed system is applied to Physio-Grid e-health platform to identify human heart disease with ECG analysis and Virtual Heart Simulation (VHS) workflow applications.",Human
"We study semi-analytical time-dependent solutions of the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations for the fields and the fluid emerging from a spherical source. We assume uniform expansion of the field and the fluid and a polytropic relation between the density and the pressure of the fluid. The expansion velocity is small near the base but approaches the speed of light at the light sphere where the flux terminates. We find self-consistent solutions for the density and the magnetic flux. The details of the solution depend on the ratio of the toroidal and the poloidal magnetic field, the ratio of the energy carried by the fluid and the electromagnetic field and the maximum velocity it reaches.",Human
"Tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB) is a widely used fluorescent wavelength-shifter. A common application is in liquid-argon-based particle detectors, where scintillation light is produced in the UV at 128 nm. In liquid argon experiments, TPB is often employed to shift the scintillation light to the visible range in order to allow detection via standard photomultiplier tubes. This paper presents studies on the stability of TPB with time under exposure to light. We also examine batch-to-batch variations. We compare scintillation-grade TPB to 99% pure TPB response. In the 99% pure samples, we report a yellowing effect, and full degradation of the TPB emission-peak, upon extended exposure to light.",Human
"Numerical simulations of hydrated proteins show that protein hydration shells are polarized into a ferroelectric cluster with a large magnitude of its average dipole moment. The emergence of this new mesophase dramatically alters the statistics of electrostatic fluctuations at the protein/water interface. The linear-response relation between the average electrostatic potential and its variance breaks down, with the breadth of the electrostatic noise far exceeding the expectations of the linear response theories. The dynamics of these non-Gaussian electrostatic fluctuations are dominated by a slow (~ 1 ns) component which freezes in at the temperature of dynamical transition of proteins.",Human
"Stability of electro-hydrodynamic processes between ion-exchange membranes is investigated. Solutions of the equilibrium problem are commonly described in the one-dimensional (1D) steady-state approximation. In the present work, a novel class of 1D unsteady self-similar equilibrium solutions is developed, whose existence is supported by recent experiments. 1D unsteady two-parametric family of self-similar equilibrium solutions and their stability are studied both asymptotically in small dimensionless Debye length, and numerically. The self-similar solutions and marginal stability curves obtained in both approaches are in a fair agreement with each other at intermediately large times for which the dimensionless distance between membranes is large.",Human
"The growth dynamics of complex organizations have attracted much interest of econophysicists and sociophysicists in recent years. However, most of the studies are done for developed countries. We investigate the growth dynamics of the primary industry and the population of 2079 counties in mainland China using the data from the China County Statistical Yearbooks from 2000 to 2006. We find that the annual growth rates are distributed according to Student's $t$ distribution with the tail exponent less than 2. We find power-law relationships between the sample standard deviation of the growth rates and the initial size. The scaling exponent is less than 0.5 for the primary industry and close to 0.5 for the population.",Human
"We consider a mixture consisting of two species of spherical nanoparticles dispersed in a liquid medium. We show that with an appropriate choice of refractive indices and particle diameters, it is possible to observe the phenomenon of optical soliton bistability in two spatial dimensions in a broad beam power range. Previously, this possibility was ruled out in the case of a single-species colloid. As a particular example, we consider the system of hydrophilic silica particles and gas bubbles generated in the process of electrolysis in water. The interaction of two soliton beams can lead to switching of the lower branch solitons to the upper branch, and the interaction of solitons from different branches is phase independent and always repulsive.",Human
"We analyze the effects of noise correlations in the input to, or among, BCM neurons using the Wigner semicircular law to construct random, positive-definite symmetric correlation matrices and compute their eigenvalue distributions. In the finite dimensional case, we compare our analytic results with numerical simulations and show the effects of correlations on the lifetimes of synaptic strengths in various visual environments. These correlations can be due either to correlations in the noise from the input LGN neurons, or correlations in the variability of lateral connections in a network of neurons. In particular, we find that for fixed dimensionality, a large noise variance can give rise to long lifetimes of synaptic strengths. This may be of physiological significance.",Human
"Ionization, excitation, and de-excitation to the ground state is studied theoretically for the first excited singlet state B $^1\Sigma_u^+$ of H$_2$ exposed to intense laser fields with photon energies in between about 3 eV and 13 eV. A parallel orientation of a linear polarized laser and the molecular axis is considered. Within the dipole and the fixed-nuclei approximations the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation describing the electronic motion is solved in full dimensionality and compared to simpler models. A dramatic break-down of the single-active-electron approximation is found and explained to be due to the inadequate description of the final continuum states.",Human
"We derive semiclassical laser equations valid in all orders of nonlinearity. With the help of a diagrammatic representation, the perturbation series in powers of electric field can be resummed in terms of a certain class of diagrams. The resummation makes it possible to take into account a weak effect of population pulsations in a controlled way, while treating the nonlinearity exactly. The proposed laser theory reproduces the all-order nonlinear equations in the approximation of constant population inversion and the third-order equations with population-pulsation terms, as special cases. The theory can be applied to arbitrarily open and irregular lasers, such as random lasers.",Human
"We consider the generation and propagation of (2+1)-dimensional beams in a nonlinear waveguide with the linear gain. Simple self-similar evolution of the beams is achieved at the asymptotic stage, if the input beams represent the fundamental mode. On the contrary, if they carry vorticity or amplitude nodes (or phase slips), vortex tori and ring dark solitons (RDSs) are generated, featuring another type of the self-similar evolution, with an exponentially shrinking vortex core or notch of the RDS. Numerical and analytical considerations reveal that these self-similar structures are robust entities in amplifying waveguides, being \emph{stable} against azimuthal perturbations.",Human
"We demonstrate coaxial atomic force microscope (AFM) tweezers that can trap and place small objects using dielectrophoresis (DEP). An attractive force is generated at the tip of a coaxial AFM probe by applying a radio frequency voltage between the center conductor and a grounded shield; the origin of the force is found to be DEP by measuring the pull-off force vs. applied voltage. We show that the coaxial AFM tweezers (CAT) can perform three dimensional assembly by picking up a specified silica microsphere, imaging with the microsphere at the end of the tip, and placing it at a target destination.",Human
"A possible solution to the hierarchy problem is the presence of extra spatial dimensions beyond the three ones which are known from our everyday experience. The phenomenological ADD model of large extra-dimensions predicts a missing transverse energy plus a single-jet signature. This contribution addresses the sensitivity of the CMS detector at the LHC pp collider to parameters of this model, focusing on the conditions expected for second half of 2010 running (sqrt(s) = 10 TeV, O(100) pb-1). It is shown that a significant improvement of the existing limits can be obtained in such an early stage.",Human
The paper reports a technique of evaluation of Feynman diagrams in the mixed coordinate-momentum representation. The technique is employed for a recalculation of the two-loop self-energy correction for the ground state of hydrogen-like ions with the nuclear charge numbers Z=10-30. The numerical accuracy is considerably improved as compared to the previous calculations. The higher-order (in Z\alpha) remainder function is inferred from the numerical results and extrapolated towards Z=0 and 1. The extrapolated value for hydrogen is consistent (but still not in perfect agreement) with the analytical result obtained within the perturbative approach.,Human
"According to general relativity, the frequency of electromagnetic radiation is altered by the expansion of the universe. This effect--commonly referred to as the cosmological redshift--is of utmost importance for observations in cosmology. Here we show that this redshift can be reproduced on a much smaller scale using an optical analogue inside a dielectric metamaterial with time-dependent material parameters. To this aim, we apply the framework of transformation optics to the Robertson-Walker metric. We demonstrate theoretically how perfect redshifting or blueshifting of an electromagnetic wave can be achieved without the creation of sidebands with a device of finite length.",Human
"By adopting a $T$-matrix based method within $G_0G$ approximation for the pair susceptibility, we studied the effects of pairing fluctuation on the BCS-BEC crossover in symmetric nuclear matter. The pairing fluctuation induces a pseudogap in the excitation spectrum of nucleon in both superfluid and normal phases. The critical temperature of superfluid transition was calculated. It differs from the BCS result remarkably when density is low. We also computed the specific heat which shows a nearly ideal BEC type temperature dependence at low density but a BCS type behavior at high density. This qualitative change of the temperature dependence of specific heat may serve as a thermodynamic signal for BCS-BEC crossover.",Human
"The effect of solar magnetic activity on the yearly mean average temperature is extracted from the historical record for much of North America. The level of solar activity is derived from the international sunspot number by the renormalized continuous wavelet transform using the Morlet basis to provide a running estimate of the power associated with the magnetic cycle. The solar activity gives the abscissa for a scatter plot of temperature for each station, from which the solar dependence and mean temperature are extracted. These parameters are then plotted against the latitude, longitude, and elevation for each station, revealing a dependence of their values on geophysical location. A mechanism to explain the latitudinal variation of the solar dependence is suggested.",Human
"Although the methods and techniques have been greatly improved since the late nineteenth century, the precision on the measurement of the gravitational constant G does not exceed 1 part in 1000. Intrinsic variations of G caused by the geomagnetic field may explain the observed dispersion of the laboratory measurements. This involves a coupling between gravitation and electromagnetism (hereafter GE coupling) and a dependance of the effective G constant with latitude and longitude. In this paper I analyse the effects of this coupling in the framework of classical space mechanics by focusing on heliosynchronous orbits. The predictions are found inconsistent with experimental data from the SPOT mission.",Human
"An analysis of the stylized facts in financial time series is carried out. We find that, instead of the heavy tails in asset return distributions, the slow decay behaviour in autocorrelation functions of absolute returns is actually directly related to the degree of clustering of large fluctuations within the financial time series. We also introduce an index to quantitatively measure the clustering behaviour of fluctuations in these time series and show that big losses in financial markets usually lump more severely than big gains. We further give examples to demonstrate that comparing to conventional methods, our index enables one to extract more information from the financial time series.",Human
We demonstrate that a single sub-cycle optical pulse can be generated when a pulse with a few optical cycles penetrates through resonant two-level dense media with a subwavelength structure. The single-cycle gap soliton phenomenon in the full Maxwell-Bloch equations without the frame of slowly varying envelope and rotating wave approximations is observed. Our study shows that the subwavelength structure can be used to suppress the frequency shift caused by intrapulse four-wave mixing in continuous media and supports the formation of single-cycle gap solitons even in the case when the structure period breaks the Bragg condition. This suggests a way toward shortening high-intensity laser fields to few- and even single-cycle pulse durations.,Human
"Spectrum of the Pauli projector of a quantum many-body system is studied. It is proven that the kern of the complete many-body projector is identical to the kern of the sum of two-body projectors. Since the kern of the many-body Pauli projector defines an allowed subspace of the complete Hilbert space, it is argued that a truncation of the many-body model space following the two-body Pauli projectors is a natural way when solving the Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the many-body system. These relations clarify a role of the many-body Pauli forces in a multicluster system.",Human
"We study the role of the dimer structure of light-harvesting complex II (LH2) in excitation transfer from the LH2 (without a reaction center (RC)) to the LH1 (surrounding the RC), or from the LH2 to another LH2. The excited and un-excited states of a bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) are modeled by a quasi-spin. In the framework of quantum open system theory, we represent the excitation transfer as the total leakage of the LH2 system and then calculate the transfer efficiency and average transfer time. For different initial states with various quantum superposition properties, we study how the dimerization of the B850 BChl ring can enhance the transfer efficiency and shorten the average transfer time.",Human
"The Actor Network represents heterogeneous entities as actants (Callon et al., 1983; 1986). Although computer programs for the visualization of social networks increasingly allow us to represent heterogeneity in a network using different shapes and colors for the visualization, hitherto this possibility has scarcely been exploited (Mogoutov et al., 2008). In this contribution to the Festschrift, I study the question of what heterogeneity can add specifically to the visualization of a network. How does an integrated network improve on the one-dimensional ones (such as co-word and co-author maps)? The oeuvre of Michel Callon is used as the case materials, that is, his 65 papers which can be retrieved from the (Social) Science Citation Index since 1975.",Human
Rotation of the nucleus and rotation of the electronic cloud of the atom/ion were considered. It was shown that these rotations are not practically possible. Rotation of the cloud of delocalized electrons and ionic core of a fullerene molecule and these of the ring of a nanotube were discussed. It was shown that the rotation of the cloud of delocalized electrons of a fullerene molecule is possible and it goes in a quantum way when temperature is essentially lower than 40 K. Rotation of the ion core of a fullerene molecule is possible in a classical way only. The same should be said about rotations in the ring of a nanotube.,Human
"We demonstrate numerically the diffraction-free propagation of sub-wavelength sized optical beams through simple elements built of metal-dielectric multilayers. The proposed metamaterial consists of silver and a high refractive index dielectric, and is designed using the effective medium theory as strongly anisotropic and impedance matched to air. Further it is characterised with the transfer matrix method, and investigated with FDTD. The diffraction-free behaviour is verified by the analysis of FWHM of PSF in the function of the number of periods. Small reflections, small attenuation, and reduced Fabry Perot resonances make it a flexible diffraction-free material for arbitrarily shaped optical planar elements with sizes of the order of one wavelength.",Human
"We study spherically symmetric oscillations of electrons in plasma in the frame of classical electrodynamics. Firstly, we analyze the electromagnetic potentials for the system of radially oscillating charged particles. Secondly, we consider both free and forced spherically symmetric oscillations of electrons. Finally, we discuss the interaction between radially oscillating electrons through the exchange of ion acoustic waves. It is obtained that the effective potential of this interaction can be attractive and can transcend the Debye-Huckel potential. We suggest that oscillating electrons can form bound states at the initial stages of the spherical plasma structure evolution. The possible applications of the obtained results for the theory of natural plasmoids are examined.",Human
"The h-index -- the value for which an individual has published at least h papers with at least h citations -- has become a popular metric to assess the citation impact of scientists. As already noted in the original work of Hirsch and as evidenced from data of a representative sample of physicists, sqrt{c} scales as h, where c is the total number citations to an individual. Thus sqrt{c} appears to be equivalent to the h index. As a further check of this equivalence, the distribution of the ratio s=sqrt{c}/2h for this sample is sharply peaked about 1. The outliers in this distribution reveal fundamentally different types of individual publication records.",Human
"A one-electron qubit would offer a new option for quantum information science, including the possibility of extremely long coherence times. One-quantum cyclotron transitions and spin flips have been observed for a single electron in a cylindrical Penning trap. However, an electron suspended in a planar Penning trap is a more promising building block for the array of coupled qubits needed for quantum information studies. The optimized design configurations identified here promise to make it possible to realize the elusive goal of one trapped electron in a planar Penning trap for the first time - a substantial step toward a one-electron qubit.",Human
"The generality of the Bethe's two dipole model for light diffraction through a subwavelength aperture in a conducting plane is studied in the radiation zone for coated conical fiber tips as those used in near field scanning optical microscopy. In order to describe the angular radiated power of the tip theoretically, we present a simple, analytical model for small apertures (radius < 40 nm) based on a multipole expansion. Our model is able to reproduce the available experimental results. It proves relatively insensitive to cone angle and aperture radius and contains, as a first approximation, the empirical two-dipole model proposed earlier.",Human
"An upgraded asymmetric e+e- flavor factory, SuperKEKB, is planned at KEK. It will deliver a luminosity of 8 x 10^35 cm^-2 s^-1, allowing precision measurements in the flavor sector which can probe new physics well beyond the scales accessible to direct observation. The increased luminosity also requires upgrades of the Belle detector. Of critical importance here is a new silicon pixel vertex tracker, which will significantly improve the decay vertex resolution. This new detector will consist of two detector layers close to the interaction point, using DEPFET pixel sensors with 50 um thick silicon in the active area.",Human
"We present some of the universal properties in ion-atom interaction derived from a newly formulated quantum-defect theory for $-1/r^4$ type of long-range interactions. For bound states, we present the universal bound spectrum, namely the equivalent of the Rydberg formula, for ion-atom systems. For scattering, we introduce the concept of universal resonance spectrum to give a systematic understanding of many resonances present in ion-atom scattering. The theory further provides a method for an accurate spectroscopic determination of the atomic polarizability. It also suggests the existence of atom-like molecules, in which multiple atoms orbit around a heavy ion.",Human
"We present a gradient-index (GRIN) metamaterial based on an array of annular slots. The structure allows a large variation of the effective refractive index under normal-to-plane incidence and thus enables the construction of GRIN devices consisting of only a small number of functional layers. Using full-wave simulations, we demonstrate the annular slot concept by means of a 3-unit-cell thin GRIN lens for the terahertz (THz) range. In the presented realizations, we achieved an index contrast of Delta n = 1.5 resulting in a highly refractive lens suitable for focusing THz radiation to a spot size smaller than the wavelength.",Human
"In this work, a shell model for metal clusters up to 220 valence electrons is used to obtain the fractional occupation probabilities of the electronic orbitals. Then, the calculation of a statistical measure of complexity and the Fisher-Shannon information is carried out. An increase of both magnitudes with the number of valence electrons is observed. The shell structure is reflected by the behavior of the statistical complexity. The magic numbers are indicated by the Fisher-Shannon information. So, as in the case of atomic nuclei, the study of statistical indicators also unveil the existence of magic numbers in metal clusters.",Human
"Bayesian inferences in high energy physics often use uniform prior distributions for parameters about which little or no information is available before data are collected. The resulting posterior distributions are therefore sensitive to the choice of parametrization for the problem and may even be improper if this choice is not carefully considered. Here we describe an extensively tested methodology, known as reference analysis, which allows one to construct parametrization-invariant priors that embody the notion of minimal informativeness in a mathematically well-defined sense. We apply this methodology to general cross section measurements and show that it yields sensible results. A recent measurement of the single top quark cross section illustrates the relevant techniques in a realistic situation.",Human
We present an improved laboratory test of Lorentz invariance in electrodynamics by testing the isotropy of the speed of light. Our measurement compares the resonance frequencies of two orthogonal optical resonators that are implemented in a single block of fused silica and are rotated continuously on a precision air bearing turntable. An analysis of data recorded over the course of one year sets a limit on an anisotropy of the speed of light of \Delta c/c ~ 1 x 10^{-17}. This constitutes the most accurate laboratory test of the isotropy of $c$ to date and allows to constrain parameters of a Lorentz violating extension of the standard model of particle physics down to a level of 10^{-17}.,Human
"In this paper, we study nanoparticles with constituent atoms ranging from dozens to hundreds of them. These types of particles display structural and magnetic properties that strongly depend on the number of constituents N. The metal clusters are important due their interesting properties when compared to bulk materials; hence they have potential technological applications. Specifically, we study the Au nanoclusters through classical molecular dynamics simulations; we analyze the total and potential energy as a function of time. Likewise, we study the geometrical structures of Au Nanocluster corresponding to the lowest energy states at 0 K. We consider the method of microcanonical ensemble, and we carry out computer simulations by operating the XMD software package and the atomistic configuration viewer AtomEye.",Human
"Intense laser ionization expands Einstein's photoelectric effect rules giving a wealth of phenomena widely studied over the last decades. In all cases, so far, photons were assumed to carry one unit of angular momentum. However it is now clear that photons can possess extra angular momentum, the orbital angular momentum (OAM), related to their spatial profile. We show a complete description of photoionization by OAM photons, including new selection rules involving more than one unit of angular momentum. We explore theoretically the interaction of a single electron atom located at the center of an intense ultraviolet beam bearing OAM, envisaging new scenarios for quantum optics.",Human
"We describe here various detectors designs: GEM type, MICROMEGAStype, PPACtype as well as cascaded detectors made of a resistive mesh manufactured from a resistive Kapton foil, (20 microns thick, resistivity a few MOhm per square) by a laser drilling technique. As in any other micropattern detectors the maximum achievable gas gain of these detectors is restricted by the Raether limit, however, the resistive mesh makes them and the front end electronics fully spark protected. This approach could be an alternative or complimentary to the ongoing efforts in developing MICROMEGAS and GEMs with resistive anode readout plates and can be especially beneficial in the case of micropattern detectors combined with a micropixel-type integrated front end electronics",Human
"Implementations of two algorithms for the transverse Mercator projection are described; these achieve accuracies close to machine precision. One is based on the exact equations of Thompson and Lee and the other uses an extension of Krueger's series for the projection to higher order. The exact method provides an accuracy of 9 nm over the entire ellipsoid, while the errors in the series method are less than 5 nm within 3900 km of the central meridian. In each case, the meridian convergence and scale are also computed with similar accuracy. The speed of the series method is competitive with other less accurate algorithms and the exact method is about 5 times slower.",Human
"We show that the local parity violation in the quark-gluon plasma supports existence of free (meta)stable knots of deconfined hot quark matter stabilized by superstrong magnetic fields. The magnetic field in the knots resembles the spheromak plasma state of the magnetic confinement approach to nuclear fusion. The size of the knot is quantized, being inversely proportional to the chiral conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma. The parity symmetry is broken inside the knot. Particles produced in the decays of the knots have unusual azimuthal distribution and specific flavor content. We argue that these knots may be created in noncentral heavy-ion collisions.",Human
"For turbulence, although the two-point velocity difference u(x+r)-u(x) at each scale r has been studied in detail, the velocity average [u(x+r)+u(x)]/2 has not thus far. Theoretically or experimentally, we find interesting features of the velocity average. It satisfies an exact scale-by-scale energy budget equation. The flatness factor varies with the scale r in a universal manner. These features are not consistent with the existing assumption that the velocity average is independent of r and represents energy-containing large-scale motions alone. We accordingly propose that it represents motions over scales >= r as long as the velocity difference represents motions at the scale r.",Human
"We introduce a technique to decompose the scattered near field of two-dimensional arbitrary metaatoms into its multipole contributions. To this end we expand the scattered field upon plane wave illumination into cylindrical harmonics as known from Mie theory. By relating these cylin- drical harmonics to the field radiated by Cartesian multipoles, the contribution of the lowest order electric and magnetic multipoles can be identified. Revealing these multipoles is essential for the design of metamaterials because they largely determine the character of light propagation. In par- ticular, having this information at hand it is straightforward to distinguish between effects that result either from the arrangement of the metaatoms or from their particular design.",Human
"Following upon our recent work on vector correlations in the Ar-NO collisions [PCCP 12, 1038 (2010)], we compare model results with close-coupling calculations for a range of channels and collision energies for the He-NO system. The striking agreement between the model and exact polarization moments indicates that the stereodynamics of rotationally inelastic atom-molecule collisions at thermal energies is governed by diffraction of matter waves from a two-dimensional repulsive core of the atom-molecule potential. Furthermore, the model polarization moments characterizing the He-NO, He-O$_2$, He-OH, and He-CaH stereodynamics are found to coalesce into a single, distinctive pattern, which can serve as a ""fingerprint"" to identify diffraction-driven stereodynamics in future work.",Human
A simple magma accretion model of the oceanic lithosphere is proposed and its implications for understanding the thermal field of oceanic lithosphere examined. The new model (designated VBA) assumes existence of lateral variations in magma accretion rates and temperatures at the boundary zone between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere. Heat flow and bathymetry variations calculated on the basis of the VBA model provide vastly improved fits to respective observational datasets. The improved fits have been achieved for the entire age range and without the need to invoke the ad-hoc hypothesis of large-scale hydrothermal circulation in stable ocean crust. The results suggest that estimates of global heat loss need to be downsized by at least 25%.,Human
The definition method of the limit for the neutrino mass of rest by using the analysis of the extreme values of the beta-particles distribution under beta-decay is given. The anomaly of distribution at the end of the curve was analyzed. The results of the experiments by spectrum analysis of electrons under tritium disintegration and the results recording of the stream of neutrinos from the supernova SN-1987A flash to estimate the limit for the neutrino mass were analyzed and compared. The problems of interpretation of the results obtained disappear in the case the mass less flavor of neutrino along with mass neutrino.,Human
A stable reference light source based on an LED (Light Emission Diode) is presented for stabilizing the conversion gain of the opto-electronic system of a gamma- and fast-neutron radiographic and tomographic imaging device. A constant fraction of the LED light is transported to the image plane of the camera and provides a stable reference exposure. This is used to normalize the images during off-line image processing. We have investigated parameters influencing the stability of LEDs and developed procedures and criteria to prepare and select LEDs suitable for delivering stable light outputs for several 100 h of operation.,Human
"A new potential energy surface for the electronic ground state of the simplest triatomic anion H3- is determined for a large number of geometries. Its accuracy is improved at short and large distances compared to previous studies. The permanent dipole moment surface of the state is also computed for the first time. Nine vibrational levels of H3- and fourteen levels of D3- are obtained, bound by at most ~70 cm^{-1} and ~ 126 cm^{-1} respectively. These results should guide the spectroscopic search of the H3- ion in cold gases (below 100K) of molecular hydrogen in the presence of H3- ions.",Human
"The population distribution within the ground-state of an atomic ensemble is of large significance in a variety of quantum optics processes. We present a method to reconstruct the detailed population distribution from a set of absorption measurements with various frequencies and polarizations, by utilizing the differences between the dipole matrix elements of the probed transitions. The technique is experimentally implemented on a thermal rubidium vapor, demonstrating a population-based analysis in two optical pumping examples. The results are used to verify and calibrate an elaborated numerical model, and the limitations of the reconstruction scheme which result from the symmetry properties of the dipole matrix elements are discussed.",Human
"It is argued that selection criteria usually referred to as ""anthropic conditions"" for the existence of intelligent (typical) observers widely adopted in cosmology amount only to preconditions for primitive life. The existence of life does not imply in the existence of intelligent life. On the contrary, the transition from single-celled to complex, multi-cellular organisms is far from trivial, requiring stringent additional conditions on planetary platforms. An attempt is made to disentangle the necessary steps leading from a selection of universes out of a hypothetical multiverse to the existence of life and of complex life. It is suggested that what is currently called the ""anthropic principle"" should instead be named the ""prebiotic principle.""",Human
"We study spacing selection in directional solidification of Al-Cu alloys under transient growth conditions. New experimental results are presented which reveal that dendritic spacing versus solidification rate evolves in an almost step-wise fashion, consistent with previous theoretical predictions of Langer and co-workers. Phase field simulations of directional solidification with dynamical growth conditions approximating those in the experiments confirm this behavior. Changes in dendrite arm spacing is shown to be consistent with dendrite instabilities confined, initially, to sub-domains, rather than the entire system. This is due to the rapid variation in growth conditions, which prevent the system from adapting as a whole but, rather, in a succession of quasi-isolated domains.",Human
"Viscous depletion of vorticity is an essential and well known property of turbulent flows, balancing, in the mean, the net vorticity production associated with the vortex stretching mechanism. In this letter we however demonstrate that viscous effects are not restricted to a mere destruction process, but play a more complex role in vorticity dynamics that is as important as vortex stretching. Based on results from particle tracking experiments (3D-PTV) and direct numerical simulation (DNS) of homogeneous and quasi isotropic turbulence, we show that the viscous term in the vorticity equation can also locally induce production of vorticity and changes of its orientation (viscous tilting).",Human
"Atomic Force Microscope images of a crack intersecting the free surface of a glass specimen are taken at different stages of subcritical propagation. From the analysis of image pairs, it is shown that a novel Integrated Digital Image Correlation technique allows to measure stress intensity factors in a quantitative fashion. Image sizes as small as 200 nm can be exploited and the surface displacement fields do not show significant deviations from linear elastic solutions down to a 10 nm distance from the crack tip. Moreover, this analysis gives access to the out-of-plane displacement of the free surface at the crack tip.",Human
"t is a known fact that near field diffraction or Fresnel diffraction calculations are difficult to perform exactly. It is in general necessary to make some approximations in order to obtain a more suitable form. In this work, a numerical implementation based on angular spectrum theory for near field diffraction is presented. The method uses Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and it turns out to be accurate and fast. In order to show the capabilities of the method, diffraction near field for a circular aperture and a spiral slit are studied. Numerical and experimental results are shown. This method could be useful to implement pc based physical optics learning.",Human
"Nonmagnetic cloak offers a feasible way to achieve invisibility at optical frequencies using materials with only electric responses. In this letter, we suggest an approximation of the ideal nonmagnetic cloak and quantitatively study its electromagnetic characteristics using a full-wave scattering theory. It is demonstrated that the forward scattering of the impedance matched cloak increases dramatically as the thickness of the cloak decreases. Nevertheless, it is still possible to effectively reduce the total scattering cross section with a very thin cloak whose impedance is not matched to the surrounding material at the outer boundary. Our analysis also provides the flexibility of reducing the scattering in an arbitrary direction.",Human
"This topical review describes the methodology of continuum variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations. These stochastic methods are based on many-body wave functions and are capable of achieving very high accuracy. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel and well-suited to petascale computers, and the computational cost scales as a polynomial of the number of particles. A guide to the systems and topics which have been investigated using these methods is given. The bulk of the article is devoted to an overview of the basic quantum Monte Carlo methods, the forms and optimisation of wave functions, performing calculations within periodic boundary conditions, using pseudopotentials, excited-state calculations, sources of calculational inaccuracy, and calculating energy differences and forces.",Human
"The behaviour of complex networks under failure or attack depends strongly on the specific scenario. Of special interest are scale-free networks, which are usually seen as robust under random failure but appear to be especially vulnerable to targeted attacks. In a recent study of public transport networks of 14 major cities of the world we have shown that these systems when represented by appropriate graphs may exhibit scale-free behaviour. In this paper we briefly review some of the recent results about the effects that defunct or removed nodes have on the properties of public transport networks. Simulating different directed attack strategies, we derive vulnerability criteria that result in minimal strategies with high impact on these systems.",Human
"The search of ways to generalize the theory of strong MHD turbulence for the case of non-zero cross-helicity (or energy imbalance) has attracted considerable interest recently. In our earlier publications we performed three-dimensional numerical simulations and showed that some of existing models are inconsistent with numerics. In this paper we focused our attention on low-imbalance limit and performed new high-resolution simulations. The results strongly suggest that in the limit of small imbalances we smoothly transition to a standard Goldreich-Sridhar (1995) balanced model. We also claim that Perez-Boldyrev (2009) model that predicts the same nonlinear timescale for both components due to so-called ""dynamic alignment"" strongly contradicts numerical evidence.",Human
"Electron-positron pair creation by multiphoton absorption in the collision of a relativistic electron with a strong laser beam is calculated within laser-dressed quantum electrodynamics. Total production rates, positron spectra, and relative contributions of different reaction channels are obtained in various interaction regimes. We study the process in a manifestly nonperturbative domain which is shown accessible to future experiments utilizing the electron beamlines at novel x-ray laser facilities or all-optical setups based on laser acceleration. Our theory moreover allows us to add further insights into the experimental data from SLAC [D. Burke {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 79}, 1626 (1997)].",Human
"The collective dynamics of coupled two-dimensional chaotic maps on complex networks is known to exhibit a rich variety of emergent properties which crucially depend on the underlying network topology. We investigate the collective motion of Chirikov standard maps interacting with time delay through directed links of Gene Regulatory Network of bacterium Escherichia Coli. Departures from strongly chaotic behavior of the isolated maps are studied in relation to different coupling forms and strengths. At smaller coupling intensities the network induces stable and coherent emergent dynamics. The unstable behavior appearing with increase of coupling strength remains confined within a connected sub-network. For the appropriate coupling, network exhibits statistically robust self-organized dynamics in a weakly chaotic regime.",Human
"I discuss Gisin's result showing that sets of quantum-correlated spacelike events cannot be described by a covariant probability distribution over hidden variables, and his conclusion that Tumulka's ""rGRWf"" (relativistic GRW ""flash ontology"" model) is an appropriate model to resolve the apparent conflict between quantum theory and relativity. The contrasts and similarities between the Transactional Interpretation's (TI) handling of a specific measurement result and that of GRW approaches are clarified. I argue that TI resolves the apparent conflict between quantum theory and relativity described by Gisin in a harmonious manner, without the necessity of modifying the theory.",Human
"An approach is treated for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations systems of the first order with choice of a computation scheme, ensuring the required local precision. The treatment is made on the basis of schemes of Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg type. Criteria are proposed as well as a method for the realization of the choice of an 'optimum' scheme. The effectiveness of the presented approach to problems in the field of satellite dynamics is illustrated by results from a numerical experiment. These results refer to a case when a satisfactory global stability of the solution for all treated cases is available. The effectiveness has been evaluated as good, especially when solving multi-variable problems in the sphere of simulation modelling.",Human
"We report on the development and performance of a high-sensitivity purity-analysis technique for gaseous xenon. The gas is sampled at macroscopic pressure from the system of interest using a UHV leak valve. The xenon present in the sample is removed with a liquid-nitrogen cold trap, and the remaining impurities are observed with a standard vacuum mass-spectroscopy device. Using calibrated samples of xenon gas spiked with known levels of impurities, we find that the minimum detectable levels of N2, O2, and methane are 1 ppb, 160 ppt, and 60 ppt respectively. This represents an improvement of about a factor of 10,000 compared to measurements performed without a coldtrap.",Human
"As compared to load demand, frequent wind energy intermittencies produce large short-term (sub 1-hr to 3-hr) deficits (and surpluses) in the energy supply. These intermittent deficits pose systemic and structural risks that will likely lead to energy deficits that have significant reliability implications for energy system operators and consumers. This work provides a toolset to help policy makers quantify these first-order risks. The thinking methodology / framework shows that increasing wind energy penetration significantly increases the risk of loss in California. In addition, the work presents holistic risk tables as a general innovation to help decision makers quickly grasp the full impact of risk.",Human
"High-harmonic generation from hydrogenlike muonic atoms exposed to ultraintense high-frequency laser fields is calculated. Systems of low nuclear charge number Z are considered where a nonrelativistic description applies. By comparing the radiative response for different isotopes we demonstrate characteristic signatures of the finite nuclear mass and size in the harmonic spectra. In particular, for Z>1, an effective muon charge appears in the Schr\""odinger equation for the relative particle motion, which influences the position of the harmonic cutoff. Cutoff energies in the MeV domain can be achieved, offering prospects for the generation of ultrashort coherent gamma-ray pulses.",Human
"This is a follow-up of our recently proposed work on pseudopotential calculation (Ref. [21]) of atoms and molecules within DFT framework, using cartesian coordinate grid. Detailed results are presented to demonstrate the usefulness, applicability of the same for a larger set of species (5 atoms; 53 molecules) and exchange-correlation functionals (local, nonlocal). A thorough comparison on total, component, ionization, atomization energies, eigenvalues, potential energy curves with available literature data shows excellent agreement. Additionally, HOMO energies for a series of molecules show significant improvements by using the Leeuwen-Baerends exchange potential, compared to other functionals considered. Comparison with experiments has been made, wherever possible.",Human
"Equations of motion for weakly coupled excitonic complexes are derived. The description allows to treat the system in the basis of electronic states localized on individual chromophores, while at the same time accounting for experimentally observable delocalization effects in optical spectra. The equations are show to be related to the well-known Foerster type energy transfer rate equations, but unlike Foerster equations, they provide a description of the decoherence processes leading to suppression of the resonance coupling by bath fluctuations. Linear absorption and two-dimensional photon echo correlation spectra are calculated for simple model systems in homogeneous limit demonstrating distinct delocalization effect and reduction of the resonance coupling due to interaction with the bath.",Human
"With the goal of understanding the intricate behavior and dynamics of collections of neurons, we present superconducting circuits containing Josephson junctions that model biologically realistic neurons. These ""Josephson junction neurons"" reproduce many characteristic behaviors of biological neurons such as action potentials, refractory periods, and firing thresholds. They can be coupled together in ways that mimic electrical and chemical synapses. Using existing fabrication technologies, large interconnected networks of Josephson junction neurons would operate fully in parallel. They would be orders of magnitude faster than both traditional computer simulations and biological neural networks. Josephson junction neurons provide a new tool for exploring long-term large-scale dynamics for networks of neurons.",Human
"We demonstrate that Zeeman ground-state spin levels in Nd3+:YVO4 provides the possibility to create an efficient lambda-system for optical pumping experiments. The branching ratio R in the lambda-system is measured experimentally via absorption spectroscopy and is compared to a theoretical model. We show that R can be tuned by changing the orientation of the magnetic field. These results are applied to optical pumping experiments, where significant improvement is obtained compared to previous experiments in this system. The tunability of the branching ratio in combination with its good coherence properties and the high oscillator strength makes Nd3+:YVO4 an interesting candidate for various quantum information protocols.",Human
"A new speculative model for the expansion of our universe has been under development by the author for the last two decades, which correctly predicts astronomical measurements with no dark matter or dark energy. This new closed model (no free parameters) correctly predicts that time increases without limit into the future. By contrast, a seldom mentioned future-problem in relativity theory is shown in this paper. Any acceleration of the expansion rate of our universe destroys the proper behavior of time into the future. The goal of this paper is to present this problem of relativity theory and remind the reader of the success of the new model   Key words: cosmology: theory; cosmology: cosmological parameters; time: general relativity:",Human
"We present a study of the dynamics and structural changes for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene between high and low density liquids using neutron scattering techniques (diffraction, small angle neutron scattering and time of flight spectroscopy) and molecular dynamics simulations. We show that changes in the short range ordering of molecules goes along with a change of the molecular dynamics: both structure and dynamics of the high density liquid are more cooperative than those of the low density liquid. The microscopic mechanism underlying the cooperative motions in the high density liquid has been found to be related to the backscattering of molecules due to a strong correlation of molecular ordering.",Human
"This paper describes a method for deriving approximate equations for irrotational water waves. The method is based on a 'relaxed' variational principle, i.e., on a Lagrangian involving as many variables as possible. This formulation is particularly suitable for the construction of approximate water wave models, since it allows more freedom while preserving the variational structure. The advantages of this relaxed formulation are illustrated with various examples in shallow and deep waters, as well as arbitrary depths. Using subordinate constraints (e.g., irrotationality or free surface impermeability) in various combinations, several model equations are derived, some being well-known, other being new. The models obtained are studied analytically and exact travelling wave solutions are constructed when possible.",Human
"Antihydrogen production in a neutral atom trap formed by an octupole-based magnetic field minimum is demonstrated using field-ionization of weakly bound anti-atoms. Using our unique annihilation imaging detector, we correlate antihydrogen detection by imaging and by field-ionization for the first time. We further establish how field-ionization causes radial redistribution of the antiprotons during antihydrogen formation and use this effect for the first simultaneous measurements of strongly and weakly bound antihydrogen atoms. Distinguishing between these provides critical information needed in the process of optimizing for trappable antihydrogen. These observations are of crucial importance to the ultimate goal of performing CPT tests involving antihydrogen, which likely depends upon trapping the anti-atom.",Human
"This paper briefly highlights the features of the software tool [RadPat4W], named after Radiation Patterns for Windows but also compatible with the [Wine] environment of Linux. The tool is a stand-alone part of a freeware suite that is based on an alternative exposition of fundamental Antenna Theory and is under active development for many years now. Nevertheless, [RadPat4W] source code has been now released as FLOSS Free Libre Open Source Software and thus it may be freely used, copied, modified or redistributed, individually or cooperatively, by the interested user to suit her/his personal needs for reliable antenna applications from the simplest to the more complex.",Human
"We demonstrate channel selective 0.1-Gb/s photo-receiver operation at telecom wavelength using a silicon high-Q photonic crystal nanocavity with a laterally integrated p-i-n diode. Due to the good crystal property of silicon the measured dark current is only 15 pA. The linear and nonlinear characteristics are investigated in detail, in which we found that the photo-current is enhanced of more than 100,000 due to the ultrahigh-Q (>100,000). With the help of two-photon absorption, which is visible at a surprisingly low input power of 10 nW, the quantum efficiency of this device reaches about 10%.",Human
"Radar data collected at an experimental facility arranged on purpose suggest that the footprint of atmospheric turbulence might be encoded in the radar signal statistics. Radar data probability distributions are calculated and nicely fitted by a one parameter family of generalized Gumbel (GG) distributions, G(a). A relation between the wind strength and the measured shape parameter ""a"" is obtained. Strong wind fluctuations return pronounced asymmetric leptokurtic profiles, while Gaussian profiles are eventually recovered as the wind fluctuations decrease. Besides stressing the crucial impact of air turbulence for radar applications, we also confirm the adequacy of G(a) statistics for highly correlated complex systems.",Human
"Evidence is provided that the global distribution of tropical hurricanes is principally determined by a universal function H of a single variable z that in turn is expressible in terms of the local sea surface temperature and latitude. The data-driven model presented here carries stark implications for the large increased numbers of hurricanes which it predicts for a warmer world. Moreover, the rise in recent decades in the numbers of hurricanes in the Atlantic, but not the Pacific basin, is shown to have a simple explanation in terms of the specific form of H(z), which yields larger percentage increases when a fixed increase in sea surface temperature occurs at higher latitudes and lower temperatures.",Human
"We examine the archetype of an interference experiment for Auger electrons: two electron wave packets are launched by inner-shell ionizing a krypton atom using two attosecond light pulses with a variable time delay. This setting is an attosecond realization of the Ramsey method of separated oscillatory fields. Interference of the two ejected Auger-electron wave packets is predicted, indicating that the coherence between the two pulses is passed to the Auger electrons. For the detection of the interference pattern an accurate coincidence measurement of photo- and Auger electrons is necessary. The method allows one to control inner-shell electron dynamics on an attosecond timescale and represents a sensitive indicator for decoherence.",Human
"We performed a photon generation experiment by laser-Compton scattering at the KEK-ATF, aiming to develop a Compton based polarized positron source for linear colliders. In the experiment, laser pulses with a 357 MHz repetition rate were accumulated and their power was enhanced by up to 250 times in the Fabry-Perot optical resonant cavity. We succeeded in synchronizing the laser pulses and colliding them with the 1.3 GeV electron beam in the ATF ring while maintaining the laser pulse accumulation in the cavity. As a result, we observed 26.0 +/- 0.1 photons per electron-laser pulse crossing, which corresponds to a yield of 10^8 photons in a second.",Human
"Mixtures of polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been produced by means of laser pyrolysis. The main fraction of the extracted PAHs were primarily medium-sized, up to a maximum size of 38 carbon atoms per molecule. The use of different extraction solvents and subsequent chromatographic fractionation provided mixtures of different size distributions. UV-VIS absorption spectra have been measured at low temperature by matrix isolation spectroscopy and at room temperature with PAHs as film-like deposits on transparent substrates. In accordance with semi-empirical calculations, our findings suggest that large PAHs with sizes around 50 to 60 carbon atoms per molecule could be responsible for the interstellar UV bump at 217.5 nm.",Human
"We here present a high sensitivity gravity-gradiometer based on atom interferometry. In our apparatus, two clouds of laser-cooled rubidium atoms are launched in fountain configuration and interrogated by a Raman interferometry sequence to probe the gradient of gravity field. We recently implemented a high-flux atomic source and a newly designed Raman lasers system in the instrument set-up. We discuss the applications towards a precise determination of the Newtonian gravitational constant G. The long-term stability of the instrument and the signal-to-noise ratio demonstrated here open interesting perspectives for pushing the measurement precision below the 100 ppm level.",Human
"The electroencephalographic (EEG) data intracerebrally recorded from 20 epileptic humans with different brain origins of focal epilepsies or types of seizures, ages and sexes are investigated (nearly 700 million data). Multi channel univariate amplitude analyses are performed and it is shown that time dependent Shannon entropies can be used to predict focal epileptic seizure onsets in different epileptogenic brain zones of different patients. Formations or time evolutions of the synchronizations in the brain signals from epileptogenic or non epileptogenic areas of the patients in ictal interval or inter-ictal interval are further investigated employing spatial or temporal differences of the entropies.",Human
"We suggest that by virtue of the very early processes immediately following the big bang incipient 1st generation particles are created forming periodic strings to confine the quarks. These strings may be described either by the Laplace equation, due to vanishing space charges, or by Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, due to finite charges. We also propose that the supersymmetry created by the big bang is broken through extended vibronic mixing at the end of the 0th generation giving rise to the diversity of atoms and molecules at the later stages of the evolving universe. We choose quark confinement by electrostatic strings supplied by 2D solutions of the PB equation.",Human
"Every measurement of the population in an uncorrelated ensemble of two-level systems is limited by what is known as the quantum projection noise limit. Here, we present quantum projection noise limited performance of a Ramsey type interferometer using freely propagating coherent atoms. The experimental setup is based on an electro-optic modulator in an inherently stable Sagnac interferometer, optically coupling the two interfering atomic states via a two-photon Raman transition. Going beyond the quantum projection noise limit requires the use of reduced quantum uncertainty (squeezed) states. The experiment described demonstrates atom interferometry at the fundamental noise level and allows the observation of possible squeezing effects in an atom laser, potentially leading to improved sensitivity in atom interferometers.",Human
"We investigate the large-volatility dynamics in financial markets, based on the minute-to-minute and daily data of the Chinese Indices and German DAX. The dynamic relaxation both before and after large volatilities is characterized by a power law, and the exponents $p_\pm$ usually vary with the strength of the large volatilities. The large-volatility dynamics is time-reversal symmetric at the time scale in minutes, while asymmetric at the daily time scale. Careful analysis reveals that the time-reversal asymmetry is mainly induced by exogenous events. It is also the exogenous events which drive the financial dynamics to a non-stationary state. Different characteristics of the Chinese and German stock markets are uncovered.",Human
We report experimental results on the dynamics of heavy particles of the size of the Kolmogorov-scale in a fully developed turbulent flow. The mixed Eulerian structure function of two-particle velocity and acceleration difference vectors <\delta v\cdot\delta a_p> was observed to increase significantly with particle inertia for identical flow conditions. We show that this increase is related to a preferential alignment between these dynamical quantities. With increasing particle density the probability for those two vectors to be collinear was observed to grow. We show that these results are consistent with the preferential sampling of strain-dominated regions by inertial particles.,Human
"A standing-wave control field applied to a three-level atomic medium in a planar hollow-core photonic crystal waveguide creates periodic variations of linear and nonlinear refractive indexes of the medium. This property can be used for efficient steering of light. In this work we study, both analytically and numerically, the dynamics of probe optical beams in such structures. By properly designing the spatial dependence of the nonlinearity it is possible to induce long-living Bloch oscillations of spatial gap solitons, thus providing desirable change in direction of the beam propagation without inducing appreciable diffraction. Due to the significant enhancement of the nonlinearity, such self-focusing of the probe beam can be reached at extremely weak light intensities.",Human
"Traditional boundary integral methods suffer from the singularity of Green's kernels. The paper develops, for a model problem of 2D scattering as an illustrative example, singularity-free boundary difference equations. Instead of converting Maxwell's system into an integral boundary form first and discretizing second, here the differential equations are first discretized on a regular grid and then converted to boundary difference equations. The procedure involves nonsingular Green's functions on a lattice rather than their singular continuous counterparts. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy and convergence of the method. It can be generalized to 3D problems and to other classes of linear problems, including acoustics and elasticity.",Human
"We consider mechanisms of directed transport in a ratchet model comprising, besides the external freedom where transport occurs, a chemical freedom that replaces the familiar external driving by an autonomous dynamics providing energy input, and an internal freedom representing a functional mode of a motor molecule. The dependence of the current on various parameters is studied in numerical simulations of our model. In particular, we point out the role of the internal freedom as a buffer between energy input and output of mechanical work that allows a temporary storage of injected energy and can contribute to the efficiency of current generation.",Human
"A theoretical study is carried out for the cavity cooling of a $\Lambda$-type three level atom in a high-finesse optical cavity with a weakly driven field. Analytical expressions for the friction, diffusion coefficients and the equilibrium temperatures are obtained by using the Heisenberg equations, then they are calculated numerically and shown graphically as a function of controlling parameters. For a suitable choice of these parameters, the dynamics of the cavity field interaction with the $\Lambda$-type three-level atom introduces a sisyphus cooling mechanism yielding lower temperatures below the Doppler limit and allowing larger cooling rate, avoiding the problems induced by spontaneous emission.",Human
"We consider a class of nonlinear stochastic differential equations, giving the power-law behavior of the power spectral density in any desirably wide range of frequency. Such equations were obtained starting from the point process models of 1/f^b noise. In this article the power-law behavior of spectrum is derived directly from the stochastic differential equations, without using the point process models. The analysis reveals that the power spectrum may be represented as a sum of the Lorentzian spectra. Such a derivation provides additional justification of equations, expands the class of equations generating 1/f^b noise, and provides further insights into the origin of 1/f^b noise.",Human
"We develop a numerical method for approximating the surface modes of sphere-like nanoparticles in the quasi-static limit, based on an expansion of (the angular part of) the potentials into spherical harmonics. Comparisons of the results obtained in this manner with exact solutions and with a perturbation ansatz prove that the scheme is accurate if the shape deviations from a sphere are not too large. The method allows fast calculations for large numbers of particles, and thus to obtain statistics for nanoparticles with random shape fluctuations. As an application we present some statistics for the distribution of resonances, polariziabilities, and dipole axes for particles with random perturbations.",Human
"We apply the approach of the Google matrix, used in computer science and World Wide Web, to description of properties of neuronal networks. The Google matrix ${\bf G}$ is constructed on the basis of neuronal network of a brain model discussed in PNAS {\bf 105}, 3593 (2008). We show that the spectrum of eigenvalues of ${\bf G}$ has a gapless structure with long living relaxation modes. The PageRank of the network becomes delocalized for certain values of the Google damping factor $\alpha$. The properties of other eigenstates are also analyzed. We discuss further parallels and similarities between the World Wide Web and neuronal networks.",Human
"Scaling symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equations are generally not variational symmetries of the action and do not lead to conservation laws. Nevertheless, by an extension of Noether's theorem, scaling symmetries lead to useful {\em nonconservation} laws, which still reduce the Euler-Lagrange equations to first order in terms of scale invariants. We illustrate scaling symmetry dynamically and statically. Applied dynamically to systems of bodies interacting via central forces, the nonconservation law is Lagrange's identity, leading to generalized virial laws. Applied to self-gravitating spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium, the nonconservation law leads to well-known properties of polytropes describing degenerate stars and chemically homogeneous nondegenerate stellar cores.",Human
"A new formulation of quantum mechanics based on differential commutator brackets is developed. We have found a wave equation representing the fermionic particle. In this formalism, the continuity equation mixes the Klein-Gordon and Schrodinger probability density while keeping the Klein -Gordon and Schrodinger current unaltered. We have found time and space transformations under which Dirac's equation is invariant. The invariance of Maxwell's equations under these transformations shows that the electric and magnetic fields of a moving charged particle are perpendicular to the velocity of the propagating particle. This formulation agrees with the quaternionic formulation recently developed by Arbab.",Human
"This paper presents a review of the methods of the science of networks with an application to the field of tourism studies. The basic definitions and computational techniques are described and a case study (Elba, Italy) used to illustrate the effect of network typology on information diffusion. A static structural characterization of the network formed by destination stakeholders is derived from stakeholder interviews and website link analysis. This is followed by a dynamic analysis of the information diffusion process within the destination demonstrating that stakeholder cohesion and adaptive capacity have a positive effect on information diffusion. The outcomes and the implications of this analysis for improving destination management are discussed.",Human
"We prove that for a combined system of classical and quantum particles, it is possible to write a dynamics for the classical particles that incorporates in a natural way the Boltzmann equilibrium population for the quantum subsystem. In addition, these molecular dynamics do not need to assume that the electrons immediately follow the nuclear motion (in contrast to any adiabatic approach), and do not present problems in the presence of crossing points between different potential energy surfaces (conical intersections or spin-crossings). A practical application of this molecular dynamics to study the effect of temperature in molecular systems presenting (nearly) degenerate states - such as the avoided crossing in the ring-closure process of ozone - is presented.",Human
"An atom in open space can be detected by means of resonant absorption and reemission of electromagnetic waves, known as resonance fluorescence, which is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum optics. We report on the observation of scattering of propagating waves by a single artificial atom. The behavior of the artificial atom, a superconducting macroscopic two-level system, is in a quantitative agreement with the predictions of quantum optics for a pointlike scatterer interacting with the electromagnetic field in one-dimensional open space. The strong atom-field interaction as revealed in a high degree of extinction of propagating waves will allow applications of controllable artificial atoms in quantum optics and photonics.",Human
"The exclusive ability of acoustic waves to probe the structural, mechanical and fluidic properties of foams may offer novel approaches to characterise the porous scaffolds employed in tissue engineering. Motivated by this we conduct a preliminary investigation into the acoustic properties of a typical biopolymer and the feasibility of acoustic propagation within a foam scaffold thereof. Focussing on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), we use a pulse-echo method to determine the longitudinal speed of sound, whose temperature-dependence reveals the glass transition of the polymer. Finally, we demonstrate the first topographic and tomographic acoustic images of polymer foam tissue scaffolds.",Human
"We use photo-electrons as a non-contact probe to measure local electrical potentials in a solid-oxide electrochemical cell. We characterize the cell in operando at near-ambient pressure using spatially-resolved X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The overpotentials at the interfaces between the Ni and Pt electrodes and the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte are directly measured. The method is validated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Using the overpotentials, which characterize the cell's inefficiencies, we compare without ambiguity the electro-catalytic efficiencies of Ni and Pt, finding that on Ni H_2O splitting proceeds more rapidly than H2 oxidation, while on Pt, H2 oxidation proceeds more rapidly than H2O splitting.",Human
"We developed superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with an optical cavity (OC-SNSPDs) for multichannel systems. For efficient coupling, the devices were installed in compact fiber-coupled packages after their substrate thickness was reduced from 400 to 45 $\mu$m. The measured detection efficiency (DE) measurement at different substrate thicknesses and the estimation of optical coupling efficiency indicated that ~98% of the input light beam could be radiated on a 15x15 $\mu m^2$ nanowire area from behind the substrate. The DEs of a NbN OC-SNSPD system were observed to be 9.5% and 25% at 1550 nm and 1310 nm, respectively (dark-count rate: 100 c/s).",Human
"The carrier or medium of electromagnetic waves has been vainly searched for many years, and now it has been caught after the establishment of the dynamic equations in photon gas. The photon's rest mass has been estimated from the cosmic background temperature in space where the photon gas is at an open state of thermal equilibrium, and the photon's proper magnetic moment is calculated from the dynamic equations of photon gas too. As the carrier of electromagnetic waves, the photon gas is a discrete medium at very high frequency, and then the Bohr's electron is hardly to emit energy in wave form and can be stably rounding the nuclei in discrete orbits at lower temperature.",Human
"We have theoretically investigated a generation of entangled photons from biexcitons in a semiconductor film with thickness in nano-to-bulk crossover regime. In contrast to the cases of quantum dots and bulk materials, we can highly control the generated state of entangled photons by the design of peculiar energy structure of exciton-photon coupled modes in the thickness range between nanometers and micrometers. Owing to the enhancement of radiative decay rate of excitons at this thickness range, the statistical accuracy of generated photon pairs can be increased beyond the trade-off problem with the signal intensity. Implementing an optical cavity structure, the generation efficiency can be enhanced with keeping the high statistical accuracy.",Human
"We report the first observation of extreme wave events (rogue waves) in parametrically driven capillary waves. Rogue waves are observed above a certain threshold in forcing. Above this threshold, frequency spectra broaden and develop exponential tails. For the first time we present evidence of strong four-wave coupling in non-linear waves (high tricoherence), which points to modulation instability as the main mechanism in rogue waves. The generation of rogue waves is identified as the onset of a distinct tail in the probability density function of the wave heights. Their probability is higher than expected from the measured wave background.",Human
"Equations for the wave-averaged three-dimensional momentum equations have been published in this journal. It appears that these equations are not consistent with the known depth-integrated momentum balance, especially over a sloping bottom. These equations should thus be considered with caution as they can produce erroneous flows, in particular outside of the surf zone. It is suggested that the inconsistency in the equations may arise from the different averaging operators applied to the different terms of the momentum equation. It is concluded that other forms of the momentum equations, expressed in terms of the quasi-Eulerian velocity, are better suited for three dimensional modelling of wave-current interactions.",Human
"Incompressible and isotropic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in plasms can be described by an exact relation for the energy flux through the scales. This Yaglom-like scaling law has been recently observed in the solar wind above the solar poles observed by the Ulysses spacecraft, where the turbulence is in an Alfv\'enic state. An analogous phenomenological scaling law, suitably modified to take into account compressible fluctuations, is observed more frequently in the same dataset. Large scale density fluctuations, despite their low amplitude, play thus a crucial role in the basic scaling properties of turbulence. The turbulent cascade rate in the compressive case can moreover supply the energy dissipation needed to account for the local heating of the non-adiabatic solar wind.",Human
"We address the properties of surface-wave solitons on the interface between a semi-infinite homogeneous linear medium and a semi-infinite homogeneous nonlinear nonlocal medium. The stability, energy flow and FWHM of the surface wave solitons can be affected by the degree of nonlocality of the nonlinear medium. We find that the refractive index difference affects the power distribution of the surface solitons in two media. We show that the different boundary values at the interface can lead to the different peak position of the surface solitons, but it can not influence the solitons stability with a certain degree of nonlocality.",Human
"We discuss the propagation of hydrogen atoms in static electric and magnetic fields in a longitudinal atomic beam spin echo (lABSE) apparatus. Depending on the choice of the external fields the atoms may acquire both dynamical and geometrical quantum mechanical phases. As an example of the former, we show first in-beam spin rotation measurements on atomic hydrogen, which are in excellent agreement with theory. Additional calculations of the behaviour of the metastable 2S states of hydrogen reveal that the geometrical phases may exhibit the signature of parity-(P-)violation. This invites for possible future lABSE experiments, focusing on P-violating geometrical phases in the lightest of all atoms.",Human
"It is shown that a transparent birefringent element whose eigenstates are a pair of elliptical polarizations with principalaxes along the x and y axes, sandwiched between a pair of orthogonal halfwave plates with principal axes along directions at 45 deg to the x and y axes, is equivalent to an element with the same eigenstates and eigenvalues but with the fast and the slow eigenstates interchanged. The device thus produces the inverse of the original unitary transformation. A similar result holds for a puredichroic element. With electrically switchable halfwave plates such a device can be used to switch the sign of optical activity or to rotate through 90 deg, without any moving parts, a linear retarder or a linear polarizer.",Human
"The infection pathway of virus in cytoplasm of a living cell is studied from the viewpoint of diffusion theory. The cytoplasm plays a role of a medium for stochastic motion of the virus contained in the endosome as well as the free virus. It is experimentally known that the exponent of anomalous diffusion fluctuates in localized areas of the cytoplasm. Here, generalizing fractional kinetic theory, such fluctuations are described in terms of the exponent locally distributed over the cytoplasm, and a theoretical proposition is presented for its statistical form. The proposed fluctuations may be examined in an experiment of heterogeneous diffusion in the infection pathway.",Human
"We introduce the heterogeneous voter model (HVM), in which each agent has its own intrinsic rate to change state, reflective of the heterogeneity of real people, and the partisan voter model (PVM), in which each agent has an innate and fixed preference for one of two possible opinion states. For the HVM, the time until consensus is reached is much longer than in the classic voter model. For the PVM in the mean-field limit, a population evolves to a ""selfish"" state, where each agent tends to be aligned with its internal preference. For finite populations, discrete fluctuations ultimately lead to consensus being reached in a time that scales exponentially with population size.",Human
"We prove Anderson localization in a disordered photonic crystal waveguide by measuring the ensemble-averaged localization length which is controlled by the dispersion of the photonic crystal waveguide. In such structures, the localization length shows a 10-fold variation between the fast- and the slow-light regime and, in the latter case, it becomes shorter than the sample length thus giving rise to strongly confined modes. The dispersive behavior of the localization length demonstrates the close relation between Anderson localization and the photon density of states in disordered photonic crystals, which opens a promising route to controlling and exploiting Anderson localization for efficient light confinement.",Human
This work investigates a kind of metallic magnetic cavity based on slit-hole resonators (SHRs). Two orthogonal hybrid magnetic resonance modes of the cavity with a large spatial overlap are predesigned at the wavelengths of 980 nm and 1550 nm. The Yb-Er co-doped material serving as a gain medium is set in the cavity; this enables the resonator to have high optical activity. The numerical result shows that the strong lasing at 1550 nm may be achieved when the cavity array is pumped at 980 nm. This double resonance nanolaser array has potential applications in future optical devices and quantum information techniques.,Human
"We present an analytic model of the refractive index for matter waves propagating through atomic or molecular gases. The model, which combines a WKB treatment of the long range attraction with the Fraunhofer model treatment of the short range repulsion, furnishes a refractive index in compelling agreement with recent experiments of Jacquey et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 240405 (2007)] on Li atom matter waves passing through dilute noble gases. We show that the diffractive contribution, which arises from scattering by a two dimensional ""hard core"" of the potential, is essential for obtaining a correct imaginary part of the refractive index.",Human
"Extinction of an epidemic or a species is a rare event that occurs due to a large, rare stochastic fluctuation. Although the extinction process is dynamically unstable, it follows an optimal path that maximizes the probability of extinction. We show that the optimal path is also directly related to the finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the underlying dynamical system in that the optimal path displays maximum sensitivity to initial conditions. We consider several stochastic epidemic models, and examine the extinction process in a dynamical systems framework. Using the dynamics of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents as a constructive tool, we demonstrate that the dynamical systems viewpoint of extinction evolves naturally toward the optimal path.",Human
"The $e-e$, $e-i$, $i-i$ and charge-charge static structure factors are calculated for alkali and Be$^{2+}$ plasmas using the method described by Gregori et al. in \cite{bibGreg2006}. The dynamic structure factors for alkali plasmas are calculated using the method of moments \cite{bibAdam83}, \cite{bibAdam93}. In both methods the screened Hellmann-Gurskii-Krasko potential, obtained on the basis of Bogolyubov's method, has been used taking into account not only the quantum-mechanical effects but also the ion structure \cite{bib73}.

"We show that a large class of helium-containing cold polar molecules form readily in a cryogenic buffer gas, achieving densities as high as 10^12 cm^-3. We explore the spin relaxation of these molecules in buffer gas loaded magnetic traps, and identify a loss mechanism based on Landau-Zener transitions arising from the anisotropic hyperfine interaction. Our results show that the recently observed strong T^6 thermal dependence of spin change in buffer gas trapped silver (Ag) is accounted for by the formation and spin change of AgHe, thus providing evidence for molecular formation in a buffer gas trap.",Human
"A dynamical phase transition from reversible to irreversible behavior occurs when particle suspensions are subjected to uniform oscillatory shear, even in the Stokes flow limit. We consider a more general situation with non-uniform strain (e.g. oscillatory channel flow), which is observed to exhibit markedly different dynamics. Self-organization and shear-induced migration only partially explain the delayed, simultaneous onset of irreversibility across the channel. The onset of irreversibility is accompanied by long-range correlated particle motion. This motion leads to particle activity even at the channel center, where the strain is negligible, and prevents the system from evolving into a reversible state.",Human
"The lasing behavior of one dimensional GaAs nanobeam cavities with embedded InAs quantum dots is studied at room temperature. Lasing is observed throughout the quantum dot PL spectrum, and the wavelength dependence of the threshold is calculated. We study the cavity lasers under both 780 nm and 980 nm pump, finding thresholds as low as 0.3 uW and 19 uW for the two pump wavelengths, respectively. Finally, the nanobeam cavity laser wavelengths are tuned by up to 7 nm by employing a fiber taper in near proximity to the cavities. The fiber taper is used both to efficiently pump the cavity and collect the cavity emission.",Human
"The coupled motion of ions in a radiofrequency trap has been used to connect the frequency- dependent laser-induced heating of a sympathetically cooled spectroscopy ion with changes in the fluorescence of a laser-cooled control ion. This technique, sympathetic heating spectroscopy, is demonstrated using two isotopes of calcium. In the experiment, a few scattered photons from the spectroscopy ion are transformed into a large deviation from the steady-state fluorescence of the control ion. This allows us to detect an optical transition where the number of scattered photons is below our fluorescence detection limit. Possible applications of the technique to molecular ion spectroscopy are briefly discussed.",Human
"Following the derivation of the trace formulae in the first paper in this series, we establish here a connection between the spectral statistics of random regular graphs and the predictions of Random Matrix Theory (RMT). This follows from the known Poisson distribution of cycle counts in regular graphs, in the limit that the cycle periods are kept constant and the number of vertices increases indefinitely. The result is analogous to the so called ""diagonal approximation"" in Quantum Chaos. We also show that by assuming that the spectral correlations are given by RMT to all orders, we can compute the leading deviations from the Poisson distribution for cycle counts. We provide numerical evidence which supports this conjecture.",Human
"We use scaling arguments and coarse grained Monte Carlo simulations to study the fluctuation mediated interactions between a pair of adhesion sites of a bilayer membrane and a supporting surface. We find that the potential of mean force is an infinitely long range attractive potential that grows logarithmically with the pair distance $r$: $\phi(\vec{r})/k_BT=c\ln r$, where the constant $c=2$ and $c=1$ for non-stressed and stressed membranes, respectively. When, in addition to excluded volume repulsion, the membrane also interacts with the underlying surface through a height-dependent attractive potential, the potential $\phi(\vec{r})$ is screened at large pair distances.",Human
"The decay of the Langmuir waves in dense plasmas is not accurately predicted by the prevalent Landau damping theory. A dielectric function theory is introduced, predicting much higher damping than the Landau damping theory. This strong damping is in better agreement with the experimentally observed data in metals. It is shown that the strong plasmon decay leads to the existence of a parameter regime where the backward Raman scattering is unstable while the forward Raman scattering is stable. This regime may be used to create intense x-ray pulses, by means of the the backward Raman compression. The optimal pulse duration and intensity is estimated.",Human
"Ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices realize simple, fundamental models in condensed matter physics. Our 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate is confined in a harmonic trapping potential to which we add an optical lattice potential. Here we realize the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian and focus on the effects of the harmonic trap, not present in bulk condensed matter systems. By measuring condensate fraction we identify the transition from superfluid to Mott insulator as a function of atom density and lattice depth. Our results are in excellent agreement with the quantum Monte Carlo universal state diagram, suitable for trapped systems, introduced by Rigol et al. (Phys. Rev. A 79, 053605 (2009)).",Human
"Characteristic properties of a Geiger Mode APD (G-APD) in a THGEM-based cryogenic two-phase Ar avalanche detector were studied in view of potential applications in rare-event experiments. G-APD signal amplitude and noise characteristics at cryogenic temperatures turned out to be superior to those at room temperature. The effective detection of avalanche scintillations from THGEM-multiplier holes in two-phase Ar has been demonstrated using a G-APD without wavelength shifter. At an avalanche gain of 60, the avalanche scintillation yield measured by the G-APD was as high as 0.9 photoelectrons per avalanche electron, extrapolated to 4pi acceptance.",Human
"Applying adiabatic, cyclic two parameter modulations we investigate quantum heat transfer across an anharmonic molecular junction contacted with two heat baths. We demonstrate that the pumped heat typically exhibits a Berry phase effect in providing an additional geometric contribution to heat flux. Remarkably, a robust fractional quantized geometric phonon response is identified as well. The presence of this geometric phase contribution in turn causes a breakdown of the fluctuation theorem of the Gallavotti-Cohen type for quantum heat transfer. This can be restored only if (i) the geometric phase contribution vanishes and if (ii) the cyclic protocol preserves the detailed balance symmetry.",Human
"By employing a self-similar, two-fluid MHD model in a cylindrical geometry, we study the features of nonlinear ion-acoustic (IA) waves which propagate in the direction of external magnetic field lines in space plasmas. Numerical calculations not only expose the well-known three shapes of nonlinear structures (sinusoidal, sawtooth, and spiky or bipolar) which are observed by numerous satellites and simulated by models in a Cartesian geometry, but also illustrate new results, such as, two reversely propagating nonlinear waves, density dips and humps, diverging and converging electric shocks, etc. A case study on Cluster satellite data is also introduced.",Human
"We report controlled manipulation of mode splitting in an optical microresonator coupled to two nanoprobes. It is demonstrated that, by controlling the positions of the nanoprobes, the split modes can be tuned simultaneously or individually and experience crossing or anti-crossing in frequency and linewidth. A tunable transition between standing wave mode and travelling wave mode is also observed. Underlying physics is discussed by developing a two-scatterer model which can be extended to multiple scatterers. Observed rich dynamics and tunability of split modes in a single microresonator will find immediate applications in optical sensing, opto-mechanics, filters and will provide a platform to study strong light-matter interactions in two-mode cavities.",Human
"We demonstrate that repeated measurements in disordered systems can induce quantum anti-Zeno effect under certain condition to enhance quantum transport. The enhancement of energy transfer is really exhibited with a simple model under repeated measurements. The optimal measurement interval for the anti-Zeno effect and the maximal efficiency of energy transfer are specified in terms of the relevant physical parameters. Since the environment acts as frequent measurements on the system, the decoherence-induced energy transfer, which has been discussed recently for photosynthetic complexes, may be interpreted in terms of the anti-Zeno effect. We further find an interesting phenomenon, where local decoherence or repeated measurements may even promote entanglement generation between the non-local sites.",Human
"We present a new approach of topology biased random walks for undirected networks. We focus on a one parameter family of biases and by using a formal analogy with perturbation theory in quantum mechanics we investigate the features of biased random walks. This analogy is extended through the use of parametric equations of motion (PEM) to study the features of random walks {\em vs.} parameter values. Furthermore, we show an analysis of the spectral gap maximum associated to the value of the second eigenvalue of the transition matrix related to the relaxation rate to the stationary state. Applications of these studies allow {\em ad hoc} algorithms for the exploration of complex networks and their communities.",Human
"We demonstrate saturable absorber behavior of n-type semiconductors GaAs, GaP and Ge in THz frequency range at room temperature using nonlinear THz spectroscopy. The saturation mechanism is based on a decrease in electron conductivity of semiconductors at high electron momentum states, due to conduction band nonparabolicity and scattering into satellite valleys in strong THz fields. Saturable absorber parameters, such as linear and non-saturable transmission, and saturation fluence, are extracted by fits to a classic saturable absorber model. Further, we observe THz pulse shortening, and an increase of the group refractive index of the samples at higher THz pulse peak fields.",Human
"Preliminary results of a photon detector combining a Micromegas like multiplier coated with a UV-sensitive CsI photocathode are described. The multiplier is made in a CMOS compatible InGrid technology, which allows to post-process it directly on the surface of an imaging IC. This method is aimed at building light-sensitive imaging detectors where all elements are monolithically integrated. We show that the CsI photocathode deposited in the InGrid mesh does not alter the device performance. Maximum gains of ~6000 were reached in a single-grid element operated in Ar/CH4, with a 2% Ion Back Flow fraction returning to the photocathode.",Human
"We show how the difference between the finite temperature T structure factors, called S_-, associated with spin and density, can be used as a indication of superfluidity in ultracold Fermi gases. This observation can be exploited in two photon Bragg scattering experiments on gases which undergo BCS- Bose Einstein condensation crossover. Essential to our calculations is a proper incorporation of spin and particle number conservation laws which lead to compatibility at general T with two f-sum rules. Because it is applicable to general scattering lengths, a measurement of S- can be a useful, direct approach for establishing where superfluidity occurs.",Human
"This article presents a detector system consisting of three components, a CMOS imaging array, a gaseous-detector structure with a Micromegas layout and a UV-photon sensitive CsI reflective photocathode. All three elements have been monolithically integrated using simple post-processing steps. The Micromegas structure and the CMOS imaging chip are not impacted by the CsI deposition. The detector operated reliably in He/isobutane mixtures and attained charge gains with single photons up to a level of 6 \cdot 10^4. The Timepix CMOS array permitted high resolution imaging of single UV-photons. The system has an MTF50 of 0.4 lp/pixel which corresponds to app. 7 lp/mm.",Human
"We introduce a mathematical model of symbiosis between different species by taking into account the influence of each species on the carrying capacities of the others. The modeled entities can pertain to biological and ecological societies or to social, economic and financial societies. Our model includes three basic types: symbiosis with direct mutual interactions, symbiosis with asymmetric interactions, and symbiosis without direct interactions. In all cases, we provide a complete classification of all admissible dynamical regimes. The proposed model of symbiosis turned out to be very rich, as it exhibits four qualitatively different regimes: convergence to stationary states, unbounded exponential growth, finite-time singularity, and finite-time death or extinction of species.",Human
"A so-called ""entropy-corrected holographic dark energy"" (ECHDE), was recently proposed to explain the dark energy-dominated universe with the help of quantum corrections to the entropy-area relation in the setup of loop quantum cosmology. Using this new definition, we investigate its thermodynamical features including entropy and energy conservation. We describe the thermodynamical interpretation of the interaction between ECHDE and dark matter in a non-flat universe. We obtain a relation between the interaction term of the dark components and thermal fluctuation. Our study further generalizes the earlier works [M.R. Setare and E.C. Vagenas, Phys. Lett. B 666 (2008) 111; B. Wang et al., Phys. Lett. B 662 (2008) 1] in this direction.",Human
"Slow-wave sleep in mammalians is characterized by a change of large-scale cortical activity currently paraphrased as cortical Up/Down states. A recent experiment demonstrated a bistable collective behaviour in ferret slices, with the remarkable property that the Up states can be switched on and off with pulses, or excitations, of same polarity; whereby the effect of the second pulse significantly depends on the time interval between the pulses. Here we present a simple time discrete model of a neural network that exhibits this type of behaviour, as well as quantitatively reproduces the time-dependence found in the experiments.",Human
"Dark-field images are formed by small-angle scattering of x-ray photons. The small-angle scattering signal is particularly sensitive to structural variations and density fluctuation on a length scale of several ten to hundred nanometers, offering a new contrast mechanism to reveal subtle structural variation of object. In this paper, we derive a novel physical model to describe x-ray absorption and small-angle scattering, and use the proposed model to reconstruct the volumetric small-angle scattering images. The numerical experiments and test experiments demonstrate that the reconstructed scattering images reveal unique features with a high contrast resolution. The proposed approach has great potential in biomedical imaging, nondestructive detections, and other applications.",Human
"The crown indicator is a well-known bibliometric indicator of research performance developed by our institute. The indicator aims to normalize citation counts for differences among fields. We critically examine the theoretical basis of the normalization mechanism applied in the crown indicator. We also make a comparison with an alternative normalization mechanism. The alternative mechanism turns out to have more satisfactory properties than the mechanism applied in the crown indicator. In particular, the alternative mechanism has a so-called consistency property. The mechanism applied in the crown indicator lacks this important property. As a consequence of our findings, we are currently moving towards a new crown indicator, which relies on the alternative normalization mechanism.",Human
"In a 2001 article, Fetecau and Zierep [1] considered Stokes' first problem for a second grade (SG) fluid, unaware that it had already been solved (correctly) by Puri [2] in 1984. These authors used the Fourier sine transform to obtain, what they believed to be, the exact solution of the resulting initial-boundary-value problem (IBVP). Unfortunately, due to their incorrect computation of the distributional derivative of the Heaviside function, an omission of a critical term in the subsidiary equation occurred, an elementary mistake (gracefully explained in [3]) apparently not uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the solution given in [1] is, generally speaking, incorrect.",Human
"We present a theoretical and empirical analysis of a number of bibliometric indicators of journal performance. We focus on three indicators in particular, namely the Eigenfactor indicator, the audience factor, and the influence weight indicator. Our main finding is that the last two indicators can be regarded as a kind of special cases of the first indicator. We also find that the three indicators can be nicely characterized in terms of two properties. We refer to these properties as the property of insensitivity to field differences and the property of insensitivity to insignificant journals. The empirical results that we present illustrate our theoretical findings. We also show empirically that the differences between various indicators of journal performance are quite substantial.",Human
According to the theory of ether light propagates with constant speed c with respect to the absolute reference frame and with respect to any other reference frame the speed of light is covariant. According to the theory of special relativity the speed of light is invariant with respect to any reference frame. The new theory of reference frames gives a different answer to this question with the consideration of two speeds of light: the physical speed and the relativistic speed. After considering a few negative aspects of the two main theories a few fundamentals of the new theory are expounded.,Human
The radio astronomy community is currently building a number of phased array telescopes. The calibration of these telescopes is hampered by the fact that covariances of signals from closely spaced antennas are sensitive to noise coupling and to variations in sky brightness on large spatial scales. These effects are difficult and computationally expensive to model. We propose to model them phenomenologically using a non-diagonal noise covariance matrix. The parameters can be estimated using a weighted alternating least squares (WALS) algorithm iterating between the calibration parameters and the additive nuisance parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using data from the low frequency array (LOFAR) prototype station.,Human
"We study phase separation in mixed monolayers of neutral and highly negatively charged lipids, induced by the addition of divalent positively charged counterions. We find good agreement between experiments on mixtures of pip2 and sopc and simulations of a simplified model in which only the essential electrostatic interactions are retained. Thus, our results support an interpretation of pip2 clustering as governed primarily by electrostatic interactions, in which divalent ions such as calcium mediate an effective attraction between like-charged lipids. Surprisingly, the mediated attractions are strong enough to give nearly complete phase separation, so that clusters can even form when the overall concentration of pip2 is low, as is the case in the cell membrane.",Human
"Certain migratory birds can sense the earth's magnetic field. The nature of this process is not yet properly understood. Here we offer a simple explanation according to which birds literally `see' the local magnetic field: Our model relates the well-established radical pair hypothesis to the phenomenon of Haidinger's brush, a capacity to see the polarisation of light. This new picture explains recent surprising experimental data indicating long lifetimes for the radical pair. Moreover there is a clear evolutionary path toward this field sensing mechanism: it is an enhancement of a weak effect that may be present in many species.",Human
"Surface acceleration of fast electrons in intense laser-plasma interaction is improved by using sub-wavelength grating targets. The fast electron beam emitted along the target surface was enhanced by more than three times relative to that by using planar target. The total number of the fast electrons ejected from the front side of target was also increased by about one time. The method to enhance the surface acceleration of fast electron is effective for various targets with sub-wavelength structured surface, and can be applied widely in the cone-guided fast ignition, energetic ion acceleration, plasma device, and other high energy density physics experiments.",Human
"We use two fiber-based femtosecond frequency combs and a low-noise carrier suppression phase detection system to characterize the optical to microwave synchronization achievable with such frequency divider systems. By applying specific noise reduction strategies, a residual phase noise as low as -120 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset frequency from a 11.55 GHz carrier is measured. The fractional frequency instability from a single optical-to-frequency divider is 1.1E-16 at 1 s averaging down to below 2E-19 after only 1000 s. The corresponding rms time deviation is lower than 100 attoseconds up to 1000 s averaging duration.",Human
"Sensitivity of future laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors can be improved using squeezed light with frequency-dependent squeeze angle and/or amplitude, which can be created using additional so-called filter cavities. Here we compare performances of several variants of this scheme, proposed during last years, assuming the case of a single relatively short (tens of meters) filter cavity suitable for implementation already during the life cycle of the second generation detectors, like Advanced LIGO. Using numerical optimization, we show that the phase filtering scheme proposed by Kimble et al [Phys.Rev.D 65, 022002 (2001)] looks as the best candidate for this scenario.",Human
"Though flux freezing is a good approximation frequently assumed for molecular clouds, ambipolar diffusion (AD) is inevitable at certain scales. The scale at which AD sets in can be a crucial parameter for turbulence and the star formation process. However, both observation and simulation of AD are very challenging and our knowledge of it is very limited. We proposed earlier (Li and Houde 2008) that the difference between ion and neutral velocity spectra is a signature of turbulent AD and can be used to estimate the AD scales and magnetic field strength. Here we present observational evidence showing that this difference between the velocity dispersions from coexistent ions and neutrals is indeed correlated with magnetic field strength.",Human
"In the current work considering the wave model of the crystal growth control, an influence of heterogeneity of the medium on the forming martensite crystal s profile was examined. The considering of the heterogeneity is provided with the help of putting into operations the space-depending effective attenuation of the waves. The description of the heterogeneity was fulfilled in three different ways: exponential, quadratic and inverse-quadratic. It was shown, that dependently of the heterogeneity of the medium various martensite crystal s profile can be implemented, considering the shape of its butts as well. In particular the plate-like and the wedge-like of the crystal shapes are feasible.",Human
"A short review of the motivations for supersymmetry in astrophysics and particle physics is given. Despite the amount of theoretical research conducted in the past decades, no observational evidence for supersymmetry has yet been found. While a large part of the community is expecting supersymmetry to be discovered in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), some of the basic arguments in favor are disputed here. Since it is not excluded that the author's view may be biased by his research, he proposes a bet on the discovery of supersymmetric particles: According to the philosopher Immanuel Kant, the bet marks the difference between persuasion and conviction.",Human
"We address the evaluation of mixing efficiency in experiments of chaotic mixing inside an open-flow channel. Since the open flow continuously brings new fluid into the limited mixing region, it is difficult to define relevant mixing indices, as fluid particles experience typically very different stretching and mixing histories. The repeated stretching and folding of a spot of dye leads to a persistent pattern. We propose that the normalized standard deviation of this characteristic pattern is a good measure of the mixing quality of the flow. We discuss the link between this measure and mixing of continuously-injected dye, and investigate it using an idealized map.",Human
"Over the last decade there has been significant progress in developing the concepts and technologies needed to produce, capture, accelerate and collide high intensity beams of muons. At present, a high-luminosity multi-TeV muon collider presents a viable option for the next generation lepton-lepton collider, which is believed to be needed to fully explore high energy physics in the era following the LHC discoveries. This article briefly reviews the status of the accelerator R&D, addresses the question of the feasibility of a Muon Collider, what needs to be done to prove it and presents projected timeline of the project.",Human
The almost frictionless transport of the very-high temperature amorphous matter which resembles the color glass condensate (possibly having much of their origin in the RHIC heavy ion collisions) in a confined annular tube with transversely corrugations is investigated by using the verified transition-rate model and boundary perturbation method. We found that for certain activation volume and energy there exist possible frictionless states which might be associated with the perfect fluid formation during the early expansion stage in RHIC Au+Au collisions. We also address the possible similar scenario in LHC Pb+Pb collisions considering the possible perfect fluid formation in ultra-high temperature transport of amorphous matter.,Human
"We study simultaneous price drops of real stocks and show that for high drop thresholds they follow a power-law distribution. To reproduce these collective downturns, we propose a minimal self-organized model of cascade spreading based on a probabilistic response of the system elements to stress conditions. This model is solvable using the theory of branching processes and the mean-field approximation. For a wide range of parameters, the system is in a critical state and displays a power-law cascade-size distribution similar to the empirically observed one. We further generalize the model to reproduce volatility clustering and other observed properties of real stocks.",Human
"With an MBE technique, a Si/Ge heterostructures are prepared containing layers of nanostructured Ge with quantum dots of size of several nanometers. The effective conductivity of the layers is determined by a quasioptical terahertz-subterahertz coherent source BWO spectroscopy. The conductivity is found to be strongly enhanced compared with the conductivity of bulk germanium. Possible microscopic mechanisms responsible for the enhancement will be discussed. Application of BWO spectrometers for obtaining precise quantitative information on of dielectric properties at THz-subTHz frequencies of semiconducting layers and structures is demonstrated by presenting the temperature dependences of dielectric characteristics of a commercial silicon wafer at frequencies 0.3 to 1.2 THz and temperatures 5K-300K.",Human
"When dealing with the dissemination of epidemics, one important question that can be asked is the location where the contamination began. In this paper, we analyze three spreading schemes and propose and validate an effective methodology for the identification of the source nodes. The method is based on the calculation of the centrality of the nodes on the sampled network, expressed here by degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector centrality. We show that the source node tends to have the highest measurement values. The potential of the methodology is illustrated with respect to three theoretical complex network models as well as a real-world network, the email network of the University Rovira i Virgili.",Human
"In this paper we discuss effective material parameter description of new nanostructures designed to perform as artificial magnetic materials for vis- ible light. Among these structures there are various split-ring resonators, dual-bar structures, fishnet layers and other geometries. Artificial magnetic response in these structures appears due to weak spatial dispersion effects, and it is important to study the conditions under which the magnetic re- sponse can be adequately measured with effective permeability tensor. On the examples of dual bars and split rings we show that this is possible only under some quite restrictive conditions. In the general case, more compli- cated constitutive relations with more effective material parameters need to be developed.",Human
"We present measurements of the beta-factor, describing the coupling efficiency of light emitted by single InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dots into a photonic crystal waveguide mode. The beta-factor is evaluated by means of time-resolved frequency-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy. The emission wavelength of single quantum dots is temperature tuned across the band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide and the spontaneous emission rate is recorded. Decay rates up to 5.7 ns^(-1), corresponding to a Purcell factor of 5.2, are measured and beta-factors up to 85% are extracted. These results prove the potential of photonic crystal waveguides in the realization of on-chip single-photon sources.",Human
"Over the past decades, the competition for academic resources has gradually intensified, and worsened with the current financial crisis. To optimize the resource allocation, individualized assessment of research results is being actively studied but the current indices, such as the number of papers, the number of citations, the h-factor and its variants have limitations, especially their inability of determining co-authors' credit shares fairly. Here we establish an axiomatic system and quantify co-authors' relative contributions. Our methodology avoids subjective assignment of co-authors' credits using the inflated, fractional or harmonic methods, and provides a quantitative tool for scientific management such as funding and tenure decisions.",Human
"We demonstrate the non-dispersive deflection of an optical beam in a Stern-Gerlach magnetic field. An optical pulse is initially stored as a spin-wave coherence in thermal rubidium vapour. An inhomogeneous magnetic field imprints a phase gradient onto the spin wave, which upon reacceleration of the optical pulse leads to an angular deflection of the retrieved beam. We show that the obtained beam deflection is non-dispersive, i.e. its magnitude is independent of the incident optical frequency. Compared to a Stern-Gerlach experiment carried out with propagating light under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency, the estimated suppression of the chromatic aberration reaches 10 orders of magnitude.",Human
"Particle velocity distribution functions (VDF) in space plasmas often show non Maxwellian suprathermal tails decreasing as a power law of the velocity. Such distributions are well fitted by the so-called Kappa distribution. The presence of such distributions in different space plasmas suggests a universal mechanism for the creation of such suprathermal tails. Different theories have been proposed and are recalled in this review paper. The suprathermal particles have important consequences concerning the acceleration and the temperature that are well evidenced by the kinetic approach where no closure requires the distributions to be nearly Maxwellians. Moreover, the presence of the suprathermal particles take an important role in the wave-particle interactions.",Human
"We consider the impact of anisotropic nonlocality on the arrest of the collapse and stabilization of dipole-mode (DM) solitons in two-dimensional (2D) models of optical media with the diffusive nonlinearity. The nonlocal nonlinearity is made anisotropic through elliptic diffusivity. The medium becomes semi-local in the limit case of 1D diffusivity. Families of fundamental and DM solitons are found by means of the variational approximation (VA) and in a numerical form. We demonstrate that the collapse of 2D beams is arrested even in the semi-local system. The anisotropic nonlocality readily stabilizes the DM solitons, which are completely unstable in the isotropic medium.",Human
"Loss is a crucial problem in plasmonic integrated optical circuits and metamaterials. The Er, Yb codoped gain material is introduced into a magnetic plasmon waveguide composed of a chain of nanosandwiches in order to solve the loss problem in such subwavelength waveguide. The magnetic plasmon mode and a higher order mode are chosen as the signal and pump light to enhance the radiation and pump efficiencies. The signal light propagating in the waveguide is investigated with different Er3+ doping concentration and signal decay time. It is shown that the gain effect can not only compensate the loss but also is able to amplify the signal, when exceeding certain threshold values of doping concentration and signal decay time.",Human
"We report experimental measurements of inertial waves generated by an oscillating cylinder in a rotating fluid. The two-dimensional wave takes place in a stationary cross-shaped wavepacket. Velocity and vorticity fields in a vertical plane normal to the wavemaker are measured by a corotating Particule Image Velocimetry system. The viscous spreading of the wave beam and the associated decay of the velocity and vorticity envelopes are characterized. They are found in good agreement with the similarity solution of a linear viscous theory, derived under a quasi-parallel assumption similar to the classical analysis of Thomas and Stevenson [J. Fluid Mech. 54 (3), 495-506 (1972)] for internal waves.",Human
"Take a large bag of black and white beans, with all possible proportions considered initially equally likely, and imagine to make random extractions with reintroduction. Twenty consecutive observations of black make us highly confident that the next bean will be black too. On the contrary, the observation of 1010 black beans and 990 white ones leads us to judge the two possible outcomes about equally probable. According to C.S. Peirce this reasoning violates what he called ""rule of balancing reasons"", because the difference of ""arguments"" in favor and against the outcome of black is 20 in both cases. Why? (I.e. why does that rule not apply here?)",Human
"We have developed a linearly-polarized Ytterbium-doped fiber ring laser with single longitudinal-mode output at 1064nm for LISA and other space applications. Single longitudinal-mode selection was achieved by using a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and a fiber Fabry-Perot (FFP). The FFP also serves as a frequency-reference within our ring laser. Our laser exhibits comparable low frequency and intensity noise to Non-Planar Ring Oscillator (NPRO). By using a fiber-coupled phase modulator as a frequency actuator, the laser frequency can be electro-optically tuned at a rate of 100kHz. It appears that our fiber ring laser is promising for space applications where robustness of fiber optics is desirable.",Human
"We introduce a measurement scheme that utilizes a single ion as a local field probe. The ion is confined in a segmented Paul trap and shuttled around to reach different probing sites. By the use of a single atom probe, it becomes possible characterizing fields with spatial resolution of a few nm within an extensive region of millimeters. We demonstrate the scheme by accurately investigating the electric fields providing the confinement for the ion. For this we present all theoretical and practical methods necessary to generate these potentials. We find sub-percent agreement between measured and calculated electric field values.",Human
"We analyze a pair of diffusion equations which are derived in the infinite system--size limit from a microscopic, individual--based, stochastic model. Deviations from the conventional Fickian picture are found which ultimately relate to the depletion of resources on which the particles rely. The macroscopic equations are studied both analytically and numerically, and are shown to yield anomalous diffusion which does not follow a power law with time, as is frequently assumed when fitting data for such phenomena. These anomalies are here understood within a consistent dynamical picture which applies to a wide range of physical and biological systems, underlining the need for clearly defined mechanisms which are systematically analyzed to give definite predictions.",Human
"The status of the R&D on the Cylindrical-GEM (CGEM) detector foreseen as Inner Tracker for KLOE-2, the upgrade of the KLOE experiment at the DAFNE phi-factory, will be presented. The R&D includes several activities: i) the construction and complete characterization of the full-size CGEM prototype, equipped with 650 microns pitch 1-D longitudinal strips; ii) the study of the 2-D readout with XV patterned strips and operation in magnetic field (up to 1.5T), performed with small planar prototypes in a dedicated test at the H4-SPS beam facility; iii) the characterization of the single-mask GEM technology for the realization of large-area GEM foils.",Human
"We show that patterned defects can be used to disrupt the sub-lattice symmetry of graphene so as to open up a band gap. This way of modifying graphene's electronic structure does not rely on external agencies, the addition of new elements or special boundaries. The method is used to predict a planar, low energy, graphene allotrope with a band gap of 1.2 eV. This defect engineering also allows semiconducting ribbons of carbon to be fabricated within graphene. Linear arrangements of defects lead to naturally embedded ribbons of the semiconducting material in graphene, offering the prospect of two-dimensional circuit logic composed entirely of carbon.",Human
"At an optimal value of the noise intensity, the maximum variability in rebound burst durations is observed and referred to as a response stochastic incoherence. A general mechanism underlying this phenomenon is given, being different from those reported so far in excitable systems. It is shown to be determined by (i) the monotonic reduction of the hysteresis responsible for bursting caused by noise and consequent transformation of responses from rebound bursts to single spikes, and (ii) a symmetry breaking in distributions of burst durations caused by the existence of the minimum response length. The phenomenon is studied numerically in a Morris-Lecar model for neurons and its mechanism is explained with the use of canonical models describing hard excitation states.",Human
"The Lagrange point $L_1$ for the Sun-Earth system is considered due to its special importance for the scientific community for the design of space missions. The location of the Lagrangian points with the trajectories and stability regions of $L_1$ are computed numerically for the initial conditions very close to the point. The influence of belt, effect of radiation pressure due to Sun and oblateness effect of second primary(finite body Earth) is presented for various values of parameters. The collinear point $L_1$ is asymptotically stable within a specific interval of time $t$ correspond to the values of parameters and initial conditions.",Human
"Nucleic acids and proteins are not only biologically important polymers: They have recently been recognized as novel functional materials surpassing in many aspects the conventional ones. Although Herculean efforts have been undertaken to unravel fine functioning mechanisms of the biopolymers in question, there is still much more to be done. This particular paper presents the topic of biomolecular charge transport, with a particular focus on charge transfer/transport in DNA and protein molecules. Here the experimentally revealed details, as well as the presently available theories, of charge transfer/transport along these biopolymers are critically reviewed and analyzed. A summary of the active research in this field is also given, along with a number of practical recommendations.",Human
"We report the first experimental observation of trapped rainbow1 in graded metallic gratings2-4, designed to validate theoretical predictions for this new class of plasmonic structures. One-dimensional tapered gratings were fabricated and their surface dispersion properties tailored by varying the grating period and depth, whose dimensions were confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Reduced group velocities and the plasmonic bandgap were observed. Direct measurements on graded grating structures show that light of different wavelengths in the 500-700nm region is ""trapped"" at different positions along the grating, consistent with computer simulations, thus verifying the ""rainbow"" trapping effect. The trapped rainbow effect offers exciting pathways for optical information storage and optical delays in photonic circuits at ambient temperature.",Human
"Dynamics of a single stranded DNA, which can form a hairpin have been studied in the constant force ensemble. Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we obtained the force-temperature diagram, which differs from the theoretical prediction based on the lattice model. Probability analysis of the extreme bases of the stem revealed that at high temperature, the hairpin to coil transition is entropy dominated and the loop contributes significantly in its opening. However, at low temperature, the transition is force driven and the hairpin opens from the stem side. It is shown that the elastic energy plays a crucial role at high force. As a result, the phase diagram differs significantly with the theoretical prediction.",Human
"We investigate collaborative and interdisciplinary research features of University College Dublin, using methods from social network analysis to analyze and visualize (co-)publications covered by the Web of Science from 1998 through 2007. We account for the extent of interdisciplinarity in collaborations, distinguishing collaborations between schools within one college (""small interdisciplinarity"") from collaborations between schools in different colleges (""big interdisciplinarity""). Based on the interdisciplinary nature, we compare the types of collaboration to a model of random matching across units, observing several marked differences. During the period of consideration, collaborations within UC Dublin nearly doubled, almost entirely due to the increasing level of intra-school collaborations.",Human
"We consider a 4D model for photon production induced by a %superluminal refractive index perturbation in a dielectric medium. We show that, in this model, we can infer the presence of a Hawking type effect. This prediction shows up both in the analogue Hawking framework, which is implemented in the pulse frame and relies on the peculiar properties of the effective geometry in which quantum fields propagate, as well as in the laboratory frame, through standard quantum field theory calculations. Effects of optical dispersion are also taken into account, and are shown to provide a limited energy bandwidth for the emission of Hawking radiation.",Human
The onset of thermal convection in a horizontal layer of a colloidal suspension is investigated in terms of a continuum model for binary-fluid mixtures where the viscosity depends on the local concentration of colloidal particles. With an increasing difference between the viscosity at the warmer and the colder boundary the threshold of convection is reduced in the range of positive values of the separation ratio psi with the onset of stationary convection as well as in the range of negative values of psi with an oscillatory Hopf bifurcation. Additionally the convection rolls are shifted downwards with respect to the center of the horizontal layer for stationary convection (psi>0) and upwards for the Hopf bifurcation (psi<0).,Human
"We study synchronization of locally coupled noisy phase oscillators which move diffusively in a one-dimensional ring. Together with the disordered and the globally synchronized states, the system also exhibits several wave-like states which display local order. We use a statistical description valid for a large number of oscillators to show that for any finite system there is a critical spatial diffusion above which all wave-like solutions become unstable. Through Langevin simulations, we show that the transition to global synchronization is mediated by the relative size of attractor basins associated to wave-like states. Spatial diffusion disrupts these states and paves the way for the system to attain global synchronization.",Human
"Despite the widely-held premise that initial boundary conditions (BCs) corresponding to measurements/interactions can fully specify a physical subsystem, a literal reading of Hamilton's principle would imply that both initial and final BCs are required (or more generally, a BC on a closed hypersurface in spacetime). Such a time-symmetric perspective of BCs, as applied to classical fields, leads to interesting parallels with quantum theory. This paper will map out some of the consequences of this counter-intuitive premise, as applied to covariant classical fields. The most notable result is the contextuality of fields constrained in this manner, naturally bypassing the usual arguments against so-called ""realistic"" interpretations of quantum phenomena.",Human
"Positronium is an ideal system for the research of the QED, especially for the QED in bound state. The discrepancy of 3.9\sigma is found recently between the measured HFS values and the QED prediction ($O(\alpha^3)$). It might be due to the contribution of the unknown new physics or the systematic problems in the previous all measurements. We propose new method to measure HFS precisely and directly. A gyrotron, a novel sub-THz light source is used with a high-finesse Fabry-P\'erot cavity to obtain enough radiation power at 203 GHz. The present status of the optimization studies and current design of the experiment are described.",Human
"We study the optical properties of a two-axis galvanometric optical scanner constituted by a pair of rotating planar mirrors, focusing our attention on the transformation induced on the polarization state of the input beam. We obtain the matrix that defines the transformation of the propagation direction of the beam and the Jones matrix that defines the transformation of the polarization state. Both matrices are expressed in terms of the rotation angles of two mirrors. Finally, we calculate the parameters of the general rotation in the Poincare' sphere that describes the change of polarization state for each mutual orientation of the mirrors.",Human
"We analize the dipole spectrum of a two-level atom excited by a non-resonant intense monochromatic field, under the electric dipole approximation and beyond the rotating wave approximation. We show that the apparently complex spectral structure can be completely described by two families: harmonic frequencies of the driving field and field-induced nonlinear fluorescence. Our formulation of the problem provides quantitative laws for the most relevant spectral features: harmonic ratios and phases, non-perturbative Stark shift, and frequency limits of the harmonic plateau. In particular, we demonstrate the locking of the harmonic phases at the wings of the plateau opening the possibility of ultra-short pulse generation through harmonic filtering.",Human
"The interface behaviour between steel and concrete, during pull-out tests, is numerically investigated using an interface model coupling adhesion and Coulomb friction. This model, first developed by Raous, Cang\'emi, Cocou and Monerie (RCCM), is based on the adhesion intensity variable, introduced by Fr\'emond, which is a surface damage variable. The RCCM model is here completed by taking a variable friction coefficient to simulate the slip weakening of the interface when sliding occurs. Identification of the parameters and validation of the model are carried on pull out experiments conducted at the INSA of Toulouse on steel-concrete interface of reinforced concrete.",Human
Advanced quantum information science and technology (QIST) applications place exacting de- mands on optical components. Quantum waveguide circuits offer a route to scalable QIST on a chip. Superconducting single-photon detectors (SSPDs) provide infrared single-photon sensitivity combined with low dark counts and picosecond timing resolution. In this study we bring these two technologies together. Using SSPDs we observe a two-photon interference visibility of 92.3\pm1.0% in a silica-on-silicon waveguide directional coupler at \lamda = 804 nm-higher than that measured with silicon detectors (89.9\pm0.3%). We further operated controlled-NOT gate and quantum metrology circuits with SSPDs. These demonstrations present a clear path to telecom-wavelength quantum waveguide circuits.,Human
"We study the specific influence of African dust on each one of the categories of Atlantic hurricanes. By applying wavelet analysis, we find a strong decadal modulation of African dust on Category 5 hurricanes and an annual modulation on all other categories of hurricanes. We identify the formation of Category 5 hurricanes occurring mainly around the decadal minimum variation of African dust and in deep water areas of the Atlantic Ocean, where hurricane eyes have the lowest pressure. According to our results, future tropical cyclones will not evolve to Category 5 until the next decadal minimum that is, by the year 2015 +/- 2.",Human
"Existence of heteroaromatic graphene analog is predicted based upon periodic first principles density functional theory calculations. The new material, poly 1,5-dihydro 1,5-diazocine diazene, is a monolayered aromatic (planar) cross-linked polymer with cohesion energy - 6.03 eV/atom. Calculations reveal its Dirac insulator properties with narrow (~ 0.057 eV) and nearly direct band gap in close vicinity of \Gamma-point of Brillouin Zone. The predicted Fermi velocity of charge carriers ranges from ~3.41x105 m/s to ~1.63x106 m/s; thus effective mass of those could be up to ~2260 times lower than free electron one. These make proposed material a good alternative to graphene.",Human
"Ventilation aims at providing a sufficient air renewal for ensuring a good indoor air quality (IAQ), yet building energy policies are leading to adapting various ventilation strategies minimising energy losses through air renewal. A recent IAQ evaluation campaign in French dwellings shows important pollution of living spaces by VOCs such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde or hexanal, particularly in buildings equipped with a garage. Besides, radon emission from soil is a subject of concern in many countries. Several studies are done to understand its release mode and deal with the spread of this carcinogen gas. This paper aims to experimentally assess a contaminant spread from a house basement using mechanical exhaust and balanced ventilation systems, and natural ventilation.",Human
"A highly phosphrous delta-doped Si device is modeled with a quantum well with periodic boundary conditions and the semi-empirical spds* tight-binding band model. Its temperature-dependent electronic properties are studied. To account for high doping density with many electrons, a highly parallelized self-consistent Schroedinger-Poisson solver is used with atomistic representations of multiple impurity ions. The band-structure in equilibrium and the corresponding Fermi-level position are computed for a selective set of temperatures. The result at room temperature is compared with previous studies and the temperature-dependent electronic properties are discussed further in detail with the calculated 3-D self-consistent potential profile.",Human
"In a disordered medium with Kerr-type nonlinearity, the transmitted speckle pattern was predicted to become unstable, as a result of the positive feedback between the intensity fluctuations and the nonlinear dependence of the local refractive index. We present the first experimental evidence of speckle instability of light transversally scattered in a liquid crystal cell. A two-dimensional controlled disorder is imprinted in the medium through a suitable illumination of a photoconductive wall of the cell, whereas the nonlinear response is obtained through optical reorientation of the liquid crystal molecules. Speckle patterns with oscillating intensity are observed above a critical threshold, which is found to depend on the scattering mean free path, as predicted by theory.",Human
"We show that an arbitrary body or aggregate can be made perfectly absorbing at discrete frequencies if a precise amount of dissipation is added under specific conditions of coherent monochromatic illumination. This effect arises from the interaction of optical absorption and wave interference, and corresponds to moving a zero of the elastic S-matrix onto the real wavevector axis. It is thus the time-reversed process of lasing at threshold. The effect is demonstrated in a simple Si slab geometry illuminated in the 500-900 nm range. Coherent perfect absorbers are novel linear optical elements, absorptive interferometers, which may be useful for controlled optical energy transfer.",Human
"Quantum discord, a measure of genuinely quantum correlations, is generalized to continuous variable systems. For all two-mode Gaussian states, we calculate analytically the quantum discord and a related measure of classical correlations, solving an optimization over all Gaussian measurements. Almost all two-mode Gaussian states are shown to have quantum correlations, while for separable states, the discord is smaller than unity. For a given amount of entanglement, it admits tight upper and lower bounds. Via a duality between entanglement and classical correlations, we derive a closed formula for the Gaussian entanglement of formation of all mixed three-mode Gaussian states whose normal mode decomposition includes two vacua.",Human
"This work addresses unique characteristics of our Universe, namely fractal structures that consist of coaxial-tubular and wheel-like building blocks. The front view of the tubes may show a wheel, and in turn, the wheel may show radial tubes arranged as spokes. A flexible interconnect originates from magnetic fields. Neutrino astronomy indicates fractal structure in the core of stars and galaxies. Fractals are fundamental for modeling baryonic filaments important in ""dark matter"" with a topology that can be inferred from radiating cosmic objects. The rupture of dark-matter filaments may cause formation of cosmic objects including birth of the Universe.",Human
"We study collective helping behavior and bystander effects in a coevolving helping network model. A node and a link of the network represents an agent who renders or receives help and a friendly relation between agents, respectively. A helping trial of an agent depends on relations with other involved agents and its result (success or failure) updates the relation between the helper and the recipient. We study the network link dynamics and its steady states analytically and numerically. The full phase diagram is presented with various kinds of active and inactive phases and the nature of phase transitions are explored. We find various interesting bystander effects, consistent with the field study results, of which the underlying mechanism is proposed.",Human
"We have reinvestigated the B-X and C-X band systems of CuCl by recording the laser-induced fluorescence excitation spectra in 20400-21800 cm^{-1}. The rotational analyses in Hund's case (a) revealed unambiguously a singlet-to-singlet transition nature. The measured lifetimes of a few microseconds seem too long for singlets and too short for triplets, which we think is actually in favor of a picture of singlet ({1}^Pi and {1}^Sigma^{+})-triplet ({3}^Pi_{0,1,2}) mixed states in the B and C band systems of CuCl. The two excited states we observed in our spectra may be the singlets that have been strongly ""contaminated"" by their triplet neighbors.",Human
"Some of X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINS) and central compact objects in supernova remnants (CCO) show absorption features in their thermal soft X-ray spectra. It has been hypothesized that these features could be due to the periodic peaks in free-free absorption opacities, caused by either Landau quantization of electron motion in magnetic fields B<10^{11} G or analogous quantization of ion motion in magnetic fields B>10^{13} G. Here, I review the physics behind cyclotron quantum harmonics in free-free photoabsorption, discuss different approximations for their calculation, and explain why the ion cyclotron harmonics (beyond the fundamental) cannot be observed.",Human
"The paper compares the methods used to calculate matrix elements of the operator of radail electron coordinates in an arbitrary order in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation and with the use of the Dirac equation for 1s-states of the hydrogen-like and helium-like ions of transuranic elements. The obtained analytical and numerical results for 1s-states of the hydrogen-like and helium-like ions proves that the wave function reduction requirement is met with transformation to the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation and confirms that matrix elements can be calculated using only one component (either upper, or lower) of the Dirac bispinor wave function.",Human
"We study a model of opinion formation where the opinions in conflict are not equivalent. This is the case when the subject of the decision is to respect a norm or a law. In such scenarios, one of the possible behaviors is to abide by the norm and the other to ignore it. The evolution of the dynamics is implemented through an imitation mechanism, in which agents can change their opinions based on the opinions of a set of partners and their own state. We determine, for different social situations, the minimum percentage of supporters of the law necessary to arrive at a state of consensus of law abiders.",Human
"We report simulations of submonolayer epitaxial growth using a continuum phase field model. The island density and the island size distribution both show scaling behavior. When the capillary length is small, the island size distribution is consistent with irreversible aggregation kinetics. As the capillary length increases, the island size distribution reflects the effects of reversible aggregation. These results are in quantitative agreement with other simulation methods and with experiments. However, the scaling of the island total density does not agree with known results. The reasons are traced to the mechanisms of island nucleation and aggregation in the phase field model.",Human
"The distribution of the lifetime of Chinese dynasties (as well as that of the British Isles and Japan) in a linear Zipf plot is found to consist of two straight lines intersecting at a transition point. This two-section piecewise-linear distribution is different from the power law or the stretched exponent distribution, and is called the Bilinear Effect for short. With assumptions mimicking the organization of ancient Chinese regimes, a 3-layer network model is constructed. Numerical results of this model show the bilinear effect, providing a plausible explanation of the historical data. Bilinear effect in two other social systems is presented, indicating that such a piecewise-linear effect is widespread in social systems.",Human
"In modelling sediment compaction and mineral reactions, the rheological behaviour of sediments is typically considered as poroelastic or purely viscous. In fact, compaction due to pressure solution and mechanical processes in porous media is far more complicated. A generalised model of viscoelastic compaction and the smectite to illite mineral reaction in hydrocarbon basins is presented. A one-step dehydration model of the mineral reaction is assumed. The obtained nonlinear governing equations are solved numerically and different combinations of physical parameters are used to simulate realistic situations in typical sedimentary basins. Comparison of numerical simulations with real data has shown very good agreement with respect to both the porosity profile and the mineral reaction.",Human
"In the mathematical modelling of compactional flow in porous media, the constitutive relation is typically modelled in terms of a nonlinear relationship between effective pressure and porosity, and compaction is essentially poroelastic. However, at depths deeper than 1 km where pressure is high, compaction becomes more akin to a viscous one. Two mathematical models of compaction in porous media are formulated and the noninear equations are then solved numerically. The essential features of numerical profiles of poroelastic and viscous compaction are thus compared with asymptotic solutions. Two distinguished styles of density-driven compaction in fast and slow compacting sediments are analysed and shown in this paper.",Human
"We study accommodation of an excess charge carrier on long even-N polyynic oligomers C_{N}H_{2} due to displacements of the underlying carbon lattice and polarization of the surrounding solvent in the context of carrier self-localization into a polaronic state. Spatial patterns of bond-length alternation, excess charge and spin densities are compared as derived with Hartree-Fock and two hybrid-DFT methods (BHandHLYP and B3LYP) in conjunction with the polarizable continuum model. Quite distinct resulting pictures of carrier accommodation are found when contributions from different interactions are analyzed. Solvation robustly acts to promote excess charge localization.",Human
"The geometrical coupling between strain and twist in double helices is investigated. Overwinding, where strain leads to further winding, is shown to be a universal property for helices, which are stretched along their longitudinal axis when the initial pitch angle is below the zero-twist angle (39.4 deg). Unwinding occurs at larger pitch angles. The zero-twist angle is the unique pitch angle at the point between overwinding and unwinding, and it is independent of the mechanical properties of the double helix. This suggests the existence of zero-twist structures, i.e. structures that display neither overwinding, nor unwinding under strain. Estimates of the overwinding of DNA, chromatin, and RNA are given.",Human
"The main topic of this paper is the analysis and modeling of stop-and-go waves, observable in experiments of single lane movement with pedestrians. The velocity density relation using measurements on a 'microscopic' scale shows the coexistence of two phases at one density. These data are used to calibrate and verify a spatially continuous model. Several criteria are chosen that a model has to satisfy: firstly we investigated the fundamental diagram (velocity versus density) using different measurement methods. Furthermore the trajectories are compared to the occurrence of stop-and-go waves qualitatively. Finally we checked the distribution of the velocities at fixed density against the experimental one. The adaptive velocity model introduced satisfies these criteria well.",Human
"Starting from the pioneering works on software architecture precious guidelines have emerged to indicate how computer programs should be organized. For example the ""separation of concerns"" suggests to split a program into modules that overlap in functionality as little as possible. However these recommendations are mainly conceptual and are thus hard to express in a quantitative form. Hence software architecture relies on the individual experience and skill of the designers rather than on quantitative laws. In this article I apply the methods developed for the classification of information on the World-Wide-Web to study the organization of Open Source programs in an attempt to establish the statistical laws governing software architecture.",Human
"Titanium nitride (TiNx) films are ideal for use in superconducting microresonator detectors because: a) the critical temperature varies with composition (0 < Tc < 5 K); b) the normal-state resistivity is large, \rho_n ~ 100 $\mu$Ohm cm, facilitating efficient photon absorption and providing a large kinetic inductance and detector responsivity; and c) TiN films are very hard and mechanically robust. Resonators using reactively sputtered TiN films show remarkably low loss (Q_i > 10^7) and have noise properties similar to resonators made using other materials, while the quasiparticle lifetimes are reasonably long, 10-200 $\mu$s. TiN microresonators should therefore reach sensitivities well below 10^-19 WHz^(-1/2).",Human
"In recent years, social media has become ubiquitous and important for social networking and content sharing. And yet, the content that is generated from these websites remains largely untapped. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media content can be used to predict real-world outcomes. In particular, we use the chatter from Twitter.com to forecast box-office revenues for movies. We show that a simple model built from the rate at which tweets are created about particular topics can outperform market-based predictors. We further demonstrate how sentiments extracted from Twitter can be further utilized to improve the forecasting power of social media.",Human
"In many natural synchronization phenomena, communication between individual elements occurs not directly, but rather through the environment. One of these instances is bacterial quorum sensing, where bacteria release signaling molecules in the environment which in turn are sensed and used for population coordination. Extending this motivation to a general non- linear dynamical system context, this paper analyzes synchronization phenomena in networks where communication and coupling between nodes are mediated by shared dynamical quan- tities, typically provided by the nodes' environment. Our model includes the case when the dynamics of the shared variables themselves cannot be neglected or indeed play a central part. Applications to examples from systems biology illustrate the approach.",Human
"The analytical vectorial structure of non-paraxial four-petal Gaussian beams(FPGBs) in the far field has been studied based on vector angular spectrum method and stationary phase method. In terms of analytical electromagnetic representations of the TE and TM terms, the energy flux distributions of the TE term, the TM term, and the whole beam are derived in the far field, respectively. According to our investigation, the FPGBs can evolve into a number of small petals in the far field. The number of the petals is determined by the order of input beam. The physical pictures of the FPGBs are well illustrated from the vectorial structure, which is beneficial to strengthen the understanding of vectorial properties of the FPGBs.",Human
"We study the effect that the heterogeneity present among the elements of an ensemble of coupled excitable neurons have on the collective response of the system to an external signal. We have considered two different interaction scenarios, one in which the neurons are diffusively coupled and another in which the neurons interact via pulse-like signals. We found that the type of interaction between the neurons has a crucial role in determining the response of the system to the external modulation. We develop a mean-field theory based on an order parameter expansion that quantitatively reproduces the numerical results in the case of diffusive coupling.",Human
"We report experiments on the deformation and transport of an elastic fiber in a viscous cellular flow, namely a lattice of counter-rotative vortices. We show that the fiber can buckle when approaching a stagnation point. By tuning either the flow or fiber properties, we measure the onset of this buckling instability. The buckling threshold is determined by the relative intensity of viscous and elastic forces, the elasto-viscous number Sp. Moreover we show that flexible fibers escape faster from a vortex (formed by closed streamlines) compared to rigid fibers. As a consequence, the deformation of the fiber changes its transport properties in the cellular flow.",Human
"Light localization is controlled at a scale of lambda/10 in the harmonic regime from the far field domain in a plasmonic nanoantenna. The nanoantenna under study consists of 3 aligned spheres 50 nm in diameter separated by a distance of 5 nm. By simply tuning the orientation of an incident plane wave, symmetric and antisymmetric mode-balancing induces a strong enhancement of the near field intensity in one cavity while nullifying the light intensity in the other cavity. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the dipolar moment of a plasmonic particle can be fully extinguished when strongly coupled with a dimer of identical nanoparticles. Consequently, optical transparency can be achieved in an ultra-compact symmetric metallic structure.",Human
"The ALPS collaboration runs a ""light shining through a wall"" (LSW) experiment to search for weakly interacting sub-eV particles (WISPs). Its sensitivity is significantly enhanced by the incorporation of a large-scale production resonator and a small-scale high-power resonant second harmonic generator. Here we report on important experimental details and limitations of these resonators and derive recommendations for further experiments. A very promising improvement for a future ALPS experiment is the incorporation of an additional large-scale regeneration resonator. We present a rough sketch of how to combine a regeneration resonator with a single-photon counter (SPC) as detector for regenerated photons.",Human
"The article ""Caveats for the journal and field normalizations in the CWTS (`Leiden') evaluations of research performance"", published by Tobias Opthof and Loet Leydesdorff (arXiv:1002.2769) deals with a subject as important as the application of so called field normalized indicators of citation impact in the assessment of research performance of individual researchers and research groups. Field normalization aims to account for differences in citation practices across scientific-scholarly subject fields.

J. \textbf{696}, 821 (2009)] is presented, and the governing equations for quasi-static evolution of a boundary driven, line-tied magnetic field are derived. Some open questions and possible strategies to resolve them are discussed.",Human
"In the measurement of the amplitude of vibration of objects, holographic imaging techniques usually involve fringe counting; due to the limited resolution of images, measurements of large amplitudes are not accessible. We demonstrate a technique that suppresses the necessity of fringe counting: frequency sideband imaging, where the order of the sideband is considered as a marker of the amplitude. The measurement is completely local: no comparison with another reference point on the object is necessary. It involves a sharp variation of a signal, which makes it robust against perturbations. The method is demonstrated in an experiment made with a vibrating clarinet reed; phase modulations as large as 1000 radians have been measured.",Human
"We investigate the 3D structure and drying dynamics of complex mixtures of emulsion droplets and colloidal particles, using confocal microscopy. Air invades and rapidly collapses large emulsion droplets, forcing their contents into the surrounding porous particle pack at a rate proportional to the square of the droplet radius. By contrast, small droplets do not collapse, but remain intact and are merely deformed. A simple model coupling the Laplace pressure to Darcy's law correctly estimates both the threshold radius separating these two behaviors, and the rate of large-droplet evacuation. Finally, we use these systems to make novel hierarchical structures.",Human
"This paper describes an experimental setup that has been developed to measure and characterise properties of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM). The measured SiPM properties are of general interest for a multitude of potential applications and comprise the Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE), the voltage dependent cross-talk and the after-pulse probabilities. With the described setup the absolute PDE can be determined as a function of wavelength covering a spectral range from 350 to 1000nm. In addition, a method is presented which allows to study the pixel uniformity in terms of the spatial variations of sensitivity and gain. The results from various commercially available SiPMs - three HAMAMATSU MPPCs and one SensL SPM - are presented and compared.",Human

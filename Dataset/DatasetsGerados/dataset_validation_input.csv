D1-1	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands as a revolutionary tool. This gene-editing technology, derived from bacteria, enables precise modifications of DNA sequences. By using a guide RNA to target specific sections of DNA, the Cas9 enzyme can snip out, insert, or alter genetic material with remarkable accuracy. This technology holds immense potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yield, and even eliminating pests in a sustainable manner. However, ethical considerations surrounding its use in human germline editing remain complex and are subject to intense debate worldwide. As the implications of CRISPR-Cas9 unfold, the need for careful regulation and thoughtful discourse becomes increasingly apparent.
D1-2	This article reports about a novel extension of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) that allows the study of the collective dynamics of complex chemical and structural systems in a spatially resolved manner with a combinatorially complex variety of different system constituents. We show that introducing multipolar interactions between particles leads to extended membrane structures emerging in a self-organized manner and exhibiting both the necessary mechanical stability for transport and fluidity so as to provide a two-dimensional self-organizing dynamic reaction environment for kinetic studies in the context of cell biology. We further show that the emergent dynamics of extended membrane bound objects is in accordance with scaling laws imposed by physics.
D1-3	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can subtly alter the genetic code, potentially leading to differences in protein production and, consequently, phenotypic traits. These SNPs, occurring frequently across populations, form the basis for genetic diversity, playing a pivotal role in evolution. Yet, they can also pose challenges, as they have been implicated in numerous genetic diseases. For instance, the APOE4 SNP, associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease, underscores the delicate balance between genetic variation and health outcomes. As we delve deeper into the genome, unraveling the myriad effects of these SNPs becomes crucial, offering potential for precision medicine and a more comprehensive understanding of human health and disease.
D1-4	We investigate the mechanisms of histone sliding and detachment with a stochastic model that couples thermally-induced, passive histone sliding with active motor-driven histone unwrapping. Analysis of a passive loop or twist defect-mediated histone sliding mechanism shows that diffusional sliding is enhanced as larger portions of the DNA is peeled off the histone. The mean times to histone detachment and the mean distance traveled by the motor complex prior to histone detachment are computed as functions of the intrinsic speed of the motor. Fast motors preferentially induce detachment over sliding. However, for a fixed motor speed, increasing the histone-DNA affinity (and thereby decreasing the passive sliding rate) increases the mean distance traveled by the motor.
D1-5	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the humble bee stands as a vital player. These small, buzzing creatures pollinate approximately one-third of the food we consume, ensuring the continued growth of essential crops. Their unique method of transferring pollen from male to female parts of flowers facilitates fertilization, resulting in fruit and seed production. Beyond their agricultural importance, bees contribute to biological diversity, supporting a myriad of plant species. Yet, modern challenges such as habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and climate change pose significant threats to their survival. Understanding and preserving bee populations is crucial for maintaining global food security and biodiversity.
D1-6	"We propose a new simple model for DNA denaturation bases on the pendulum model of EnglanderA1 and the microscopic model of Peyrard {\it et al.},A3 so called ""combined model"". The main parameters of our model are: the coupling constant $k$ along each strand, the mean stretching $y^\ast$ of the hydrogen bonds, the ratio of the damping constant and driven force $\gamma/F$. We show that both the length $L$ of unpaired bases and the velocity $v$ of kinks depend on not only the coupling constant $k$ but also the temperature $T$. Our results are in good agreement with previous works."

By harnessing the immune system of bacteria, scientists can precisely alter DNA sequences, effectively correcting genetic defects and eradicating harmful pathogens. This groundbreaking technology promises a future where inherited diseases are a thing of the past, and the potential for personalized medicine is immense. Yet, as with any powerful tool, ethical considerations arise. Questions about human enhancement, potential misuse, and the boundaries of nature's design loom large. As we venture into this brave new world, careful deliberation and global collaboration will be essential to ensure the benefits of CRISPR-Cas9 outweigh its challenges.
D1-8	We solve the Unanimity Rule on networks with exponential, uniform and scalefree degree distributions. In particular we arrive at equations relating the asymptotic number of nodes in one of two states to the initial fraction of nodes in this state. The solutions for exponential and uniform networks are exact, the approximation for the scalefree case is in perfect agreement with simulation results. We use these solutions to provide a theoretical understanding for experimental data on biodiversity loss in foodwebs, which is available for the three network types discussed. The model allows in principle to estimate the critical value of species that have to be removed from the system to induce its complete collapse.
D1-9	 In the realm of molecular biology, the genetic code, a complex and intricate language, governs the synthesis of proteins. This code, a sequence of three nucleotides - codons, is decoded by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Each tRNA molecule is tagged with a specific amino acid and recognizes its corresponding codon on messenger RNA (mRNA). The ribosome, a cellular machine, reads the mRNA sequence, aligns it with the tRNA molecules, and orchestrates the assembly of amino acids into a protein. This process, known as translation, is a crucial step in protein synthesis, enabling cells to create the proteins necessary for life.
D1-10	Long range charge transfer experiments in DNA oligomers and the subsequently measured -- and very diverse -- transport response of DNA wires in solid state experiments exemplifies the need for a thorough theoretical understanding of charge migration in DNA-based natural and artificial materials. Here we present a review of tight-binding models for DNA conduction which have the intrinsic merit of containing more structural information than plain rate-equation models while still retaining sufficient detail of the electronic properties. This allows for simulations of transport properties to be more manageable with respect to density functional theory methods or correlated first principle algorithms.
D1-11	 Invertebrates, the largest phylum in the animal kingdom, exhibit extraordinary diversity and adaptability. From the humble earthworm burrowing through soil to the colorful octopus navigating deep-sea trenches, these creatures play pivotal roles in their ecosystems. Invertebrates contribute to nutrient cycling, pollination, and decomposition, underpinning the health and balance of our planet's biosphere. Their simple body structures, comprising no backbone or internal skeleton, allow for a wide array of forms and functions, making them a captivating subject for study and conservation efforts. Essential to our understanding of life's intricate tapestry, invertebrates continue to reveal secrets about evolution and biodiversity, inspiring awe and fostering respect for Earth's intricate ecosystems.
D1-12	Recently, structural analysis of the human transferrin and growth hormone (GH) amino acid sequences has unravelled that they harbor a motif identical to a pattern found in viral oncoproteins known to bind the primarily nuclear tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (RB). Since related signatures had previously been identified also in insulin and the two insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), the aim of the current study has been to investigate whether further hints substantiating these reported homologies can be found in silico. Here, additional similarities are presented supporting the notion of an insulin superfamily of growth-promoting proteins with dual localization in the extracellular environment and the intracellular space, particularly in the nucleus, as well as characterized by a tropism for RB.
D1-13	 In the intricate world of genetics, a gene variant known as the APOE4 allele stands out. Present in approximately one-quarter of the human population, this variant is linked to an increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The APOE4 gene produces a protein that plays a crucial role in the brain, particularly in the clearance of beta-amyloid plaques, a key hallmark of Alzheimer's. When the APOE4 protein is overproduced or functions less efficiently, these plaques accumulate, leading to the neurodegeneration characteristic of the disease. This genetic variation, while common, underscores the complex interplay between genes and environmental factors in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
D1-14	We present a simple algorithm for detecting oscillatory behavior in discrete data. The data is used as an input driving force acting on a set of simulated damped oscillators. By monitoring the energy of the simulated oscillators, we can detect oscillatory behavior in data. In application to in vivo deep brain basal ganglia recordings, we found sharp peaks in the spectrum at 20 and 70 Hz. The algorithm is also compared to the conventional fast Fourier transform and circular statistics techniques using computer generated model data, and is found to be comparable to or better than fast Fourier transform in test cases. Circular statistics performed poorly in our tests.
D1-15	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, performed by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, transforms light energy into chemical energy. Carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight are its primary components. Chlorophyll, a green pigment, plays a crucial role, absorbing light energy and triggering a series of reactions. These reactions ultimately produce glucose, a simple sugar essential for growth, and release oxygen as a byproduct, a vital component for respiration in most organisms. Photosynthesis, thus, is not only the lifeblood of our green world but also a key player in maintaining Earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere, a testament to the interconnectedness and harmony in the biosphere.
D1-16	The use of mathematical models has helped to shed light on countless phenomena in chemistry and biology. Often, though, one finds that systems of interest in these fields are dauntingly complex. In this paper, we attempt to synthesize and expand upon the body of mathematical results pertaining to the theory of multiple equilibria in chemical reaction networks (CRNs), which has yielded surprising insights with minimal computational effort. Our central focus is a recent, cycle-based theorem by Gheorghe Craciun and Martin Feinberg, which is of significant interest in its own right and also serves, in a somewhat restated form, as the basis for a number of fruitful connections among related results.
D1-17	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, Dinofelis octospatus, is a fascinating creature. It dwells in the deep-sea abyss, illuminating its surroundings with a soft, ethereal glow. This light is produced by a chemical reaction within its light-emitting organs, or photophores, which contain a bioluminescent protein called luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase. To generate light, the squid triggers the enzymatic breakdown of luciferin, releasing energy in the form of light. This ability serves various purposes, such as attracting prey, confusing predators, and communicating with fellow squid. Their mesmerizing displays create an underwater symphony, shedding light on the wonders of life beneath the waves.
D1-18	The diversity of a community that cannot be fully counted must be inferred. The two preeminent inference methods are the MaxEnt method, which uses information in the form of constraints and Bayes' rule which uses information in the form of data. It has been shown that these two methods are special cases of the method of Maximum (relative) Entropy (ME). We demonstrate how this method can be used as a measure of diversity that not only reproduces the features of Shannon's index but exceeds them by allowing more types of information to be included in the inference. A specific example is solved in detail. Additionally, the entropy that is found is the same form as the thermodynamic entropy.
D1-19	 In the realm of genetics, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds. This process, fundamental to life, ensures the faithful duplication of genetic information from one cell to another. As the double helix splits, each strand serves as a template for a new complementary strand, synthesized by enzymes. This results in two identical copies of DNA, ready to guide the growth and function of a new cell. The precision of this dance, a testament to nature's complexity, underpins our understanding of heredity and evolution.
D1-20	We describe a model of electron transfer reactions affected by local binding to the donor or acceptor sites of a particle in equilibrium with the solution. The statistics of fluctuations of the donor-acceptor energy gap caused by binding/unbinding events are non-Gaussian, and the resulting free energy surfaces of electron transfer are non-parabolic. The band-width of the charge-transfer optical transition is predicted to pass through a maximum as a function of the concentration of binding particles in the solution. The model is used to rationalize recent observations of pH-dependence of electron transfer rates involving changes in the protonation state of the donor-acceptor complex.
D1-21	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone process. This biochemical reaction, carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This transformation, occurring within the chloroplasts, is crucial for sustaining life on our planet. It not only fuels the growth and reproduction of plants but also produces oxygen, a vital resource for respiring organisms, including humans. Photosynthesis, thus, epitomizes the symbiotic interplay between organisms, underpinning the delicate balance of ecosystems and the very survival of life on Earth.
D1-22	We compute absolute binding affinities for two ligands bound to the FKBP protein using non-equilibrium unbinding simulations. The methodology is straight-forward, requiring little or no modification to many modern molecular simulation packages. The approach makes use of a physical pathway, eliminating the need for complicated alchemical decoupling schemes. Results of this study are promising. For the ligands studied here the binding affinities are typically estimated within less than 4.0 kJ/mol of the target values. and the target values are within less than 1.0 kJ/mol of experiment. These results suggest that non-equilibrium simulation could provide a simple and robust means to estimate protein-ligand binding affinities.
D1-23	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant twist. Unlike DNA sequence changes, epigenetics revolves around modifications in gene expression, primarily through DNA methylation and histone modification. These alterations are influenced by various factors such as age, environment, and lifestyle choices, thereby impacting gene function without altering the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetic changes can be heritable, but unlike genetic mutations, they are potentially reversible, offering profound implications for understanding development, disease susceptibility, and even the effects of trauma across generations. This dynamic interplay between genes and their environment, as mediated by epigenetics, illuminates the complex interconnections between nature and nurture in biological systems.
D1-24	The birth/death process with mutation describes the evolution of a population, and displays rich dynamics including clustering and fluctuations. We discuss an analytical `field-theoretical' approach to the birth/death process, using a simple dimensional analysis argument to describe evolution as a `Super-Brownian Motion' in the infinite population limit. The field theory technique provides corrections to this for large but finite population, and an exact description at arbitrary population size. This allows a characterisation of the difference between the evolution of a phenotype, for which strong local clustering is observed, and a genotype for which distributions are more dispersed. We describe the approach with sufficient detail for non-specialists.
D1-25	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) serves as a fundamental building block in the genetic variation of species. SNPs, being the most common type of genetic variation among individuals, can have profound impacts on traits, diseases, and responses to drugs. These minute differences in DNA sequences, often invisible to the naked eye, can unravel complex biological phenomena, offering valuable insights into human ancestry, evolution, and potential for personalized medicine. The exploration of SNPs, therefore, represents a significant stride in our understanding of the complex tapestry of life.
D1-26	We implement a well-established concept to consider dispersion effects within a Poisson-Boltzmann approach of continuum solvation of proteins. The theoretical framework is particularly suited for boundary element methods. Free parameters are determined by comparison to experimental data as well as high-level quantum mechanical reference calculations. The method is general and can be easily extended in several directions. The model is tested on various chemical substances and found to yield good-quality estimates of the solvation free energy without obvious indication of any introduced bias. Once optimized, the model is applied to a series of proteins, and factors such as protein size or partial charge assignments are studied.
D1-27	 In the realm of genetics, DNA sequencing revolutionizes our understanding of biological diversity and evolution. This technology deciphers the order of nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, in an organism's genome. By comparing DNA sequences across species, scientists can trace their evolutionary relationships and map the journey of life on Earth. DNA sequencing also paves the way for personalized medicine, as it allows for the identification of genetic markers linked to diseases. This knowledge can guide more effective treatment strategies tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes. Thus, DNA sequencing not only advances our comprehension of the intricate tapestry of life but also holds immense potential for medical advancements and the betterment of human health.
D1-28	We probe the dynamic strength of multiple biotin-streptavidin adhesion bonds under linear loading using the biomembrane force probe setup for dynamic force spectroscopy. Measured rupture force histograms are compared to results from a master equation model for the stochastic dynamics of bond rupture under load. This allows us to extract the distribution of the number of initially closed bonds. We also extract the molecular parameters of the adhesion bonds, in good agreement with earlier results from single bond experiments. Our analysis shows that the peaks in the measured histograms are not simple multiples of the single bond values, but follow from a superposition procedure which generates different peak positions.
D1-29	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized the field, offering a precise, efficient, and cost-effective method for gene editing. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacteria, harnesses the power of RNA and an enzyme complex to snip DNA at specific locations. This allows for the correction of genetic mutations linked to diseases, the enhancement of crop resistance to pests, and even the potential for personalized medicine. The implications of CRISPR-Cas9 are vast, spanning from medicine and agriculture to basic research, as scientists delve deeper into understanding the intricate dance of genes and their role in life's most fundamental processes.
D1-30	This Letter studies the quasispecies dynamics of a population capable of genetic repair evolving on a time-dependent fitness landscape. We develop a model that considers an asexual population of single-stranded, conservatively replicating genomes, whose only source of genetic variation is due to copying errors during replication. We consider a time-dependent, single-fitness-peak landscape where the master sequence changes by a single point mutation every time $ \tau $. We are able to analytically solve for the evolutionary dynamics of the population in the point-mutation limit. In particular, our model provides an analytical expression for the fraction of mutators in the dynamic fitness landscape that agrees well with results from stochastic simulations.
D1-31	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly impact an organism's traits and diseases susceptibility. These minute differences in DNA sequence, often found in coding regions, can lead to varied protein structures and functions. The Human Genome Project's completion in 2003 paved the way for understanding these SNPs at a grand scale, opening doors for personalized medicine and disease prevention strategies. However, the complexity of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions ensures that exploring this genetic landscape will continue to present both challenges and tantalizing discoveries.
D1-32	The occurrence of a critical period of plasticity in the visual cortex has long been established, yet its function in normal development is not fully understood. Here we show that as the late phase of the critical period unfolds, different areas of cat visual cortex develop in a coordinated manner. Orientation columns in areas V1 and V2 become matched in size in regions that are mutually connected. The same age trend is found for such regions in the left and right brain hemisphere. Our results indicate that a function of critical period plasticity is to progressively coordinate the functional architectures of different cortical areas - even across hemispheres.
D1-33	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone. This biological process, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose fuels the organism's growth and energy needs, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere, sustaining the very environment that enables photosynthesis. This cyclical dance of life and the environment, driven by photons and chlorophyll, is a testament to the stunning complexity and interconnectedness within the natural world.
D1-34	Fifty years ago, John von Neumann compared the architecture of the brain with that of computers that he invented and which is still in use today. In those days, the organisation of computers was based on concepts of brain organisation. Here, we give an update on current results on the global organisation of neural systems. For neural systems, we outline how the spatial and topological architecture of neuronal and cortical networks facilitates robustness against failures, fast processing, and balanced network activation. Finally, we discuss mechanisms of self-organization for such architectures. After all, the organization of the brain might again inspire computer architecture.

This revolutionary tool allows for precise, targeted alterations of DNA sequences, offering unprecedented potential in areas such as gene therapy, crop improvement, and even disease prevention. By harnessing the power of bacterial immune defense mechanisms, scientists can now edit genomes with unparalleled efficiency and accuracy, opening doors to a future where inherited diseases may no longer be a death sentence, and food scarcity could be a thing of the past. The CRISPR-Cas9 system represents the vanguard of genetic engineering, heralding a new era of biological innovation.
D1-36	Active cellular transport is a fundamental mechanism for protein and vesicle delivery, cell cycle and molecular degradation. Viruses can hijack the transport system and use it to reach the nucleus. Most transport processes consist of intermittent dynamics, where the motion of a particle, such as a virus, alternates between pure Brownian and directed movement along microtubules. In this communication, we estimate the mean time for particle to attach to a microtubule network. This computation leads to a coarse grained equation of the intermittent motion in radial and cylindrical geometries. Finally, by using the degradation activity inside the cytoplasm, we obtain refined asymptotic estimations for the probability and the mean time a virus reaches a small nuclear pore.
D1-37	" In the intricate realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often dubbed the ""powerhouses"" of cells, play a pivotal role. They are responsible for generating most of the energy required for a cell's functions, a process known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria's unique structure, with its double membrane and intricate inner compartments, houses vital enzymes that facilitate this energy production. Interestingly, mitochondria have their own DNA separate from the nucleus, suggesting an independent origin from the rest of the cell. This discovery underscores the complexity of cellular life and the intriguing evolutionary history that led to its development."
D1-38	Dynamin is a ubiquitous GTPase that tubulates lipid bilayers and is implicated in many membrane severing processes in eukaryotic cells. Setting the grounds for a better understanding of this biological function, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics description of the conformational change of large dynamin-membrane tubes taking into account GTP consumption as a free energy source. On observable time scales, dissipation is dominated by an effective dynamin/membrane friction and the deformation field of the tube has a simple diffusive behavior, which could be tested experimentally. A more involved, semi-microscopic model yields complete predictions for the dynamics of the tube and possibly accounts for contradictory experimental results concerning its change of conformation as well as for plectonemic supercoiling.
D1-39	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool, has emerged as a game-changer. This innovative system, derived from bacterial immunity mechanisms, enables precise editing of DNA sequences. By introducing small RNA molecules that guide the Cas9 enzyme to a specific gene location, researchers can effectively alter, correct, or delete targeted DNA segments. This groundbreaking technology holds enormous potential in various fields, such as treating genetic diseases, enhancing crop resistance to pests, and even eradicating harmful pathogens in humans. The ethical and environmental implications of CRISPR are vast and complex, necessitating careful consideration and regulation to ensure its responsible application.
D1-40	Conventional kinesin is a motor protein, which is able to walk along a microtubule processively. The exact mechanism of the stepping motion and force generation of kinesin is still far from clear. In this paper we argue that neck linker docking is a crucial element of this mechanism, without which the experimentally observed dwell times of the steps could not be explained under a wide range of loading forces. We also show that the experimental data impose very strict constraints on the lengths of both the neck linker and its docking section, which are compatible with the known structure of kinesin.
D1-41	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating discovery is the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a revolutionary tool for gene editing. This intricate biological mechanism, found in bacteria, allows precise manipulation of DNA sequences. By designing specific RNA guides, scientists can direct the Cas9 enzyme to a targeted gene, causing deletions, substitutions, or insertions, effectively altering the genetic code. This groundbreaking technology holds immense potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yield, and even customizing animal traits. The ability to edit genomes has opened a new era in biology, offering a path to address some of humanity's most pressing challenges.
D1-42	The idea of the evolution of the genetic code from the CG to the CGUA alphabet has been developed further. The assumption of the originally triplet structure of the genetic code has been substantiated. The hypothesis of the emergence of stop codons at the early stage of the evolution of the genetic code has been additionally supported. The existence of strong and weak letter doublets of codons and the symmetry of strong doublets in the genetic code table, discovered by Rumer, have been explained. A hypothesis concerning the primary structure of the first gene and the first protein has been proposed.
D1-43	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, performed primarily by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This vital process sustains virtually all life on Earth, generating oxygen that animals, including humans, depend on for respiration. The photosynthetic journey begins in chloroplasts, cellular organelles containing pigments like chlorophyll, which absorb sunlight. The captured energy drives the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, releasing excess energy as heat. This symbiotic dance between plants and sunlight not only fuels life on Earth but also plays a crucial role in regulating our planet's climate.
D1-44	We study the reliability of large networks of coupled neural oscillators in response to fluctuating stimuli. Reliability means that a stimulus elicits essentially identical responses upon repeated presentations. We view the problem on two scales: neuronal reliability, which concerns the repeatability of spike times of individual neurons embedded within a network, and pooled-response reliability, which addresses the repeatability of the total synaptic output from the network. We find that individual embedded neurons can be reliable or unreliable depending on network conditions, whereas pooled responses of sufficiently large networks are mostly reliable. We study also the effects of noise, and find that some types affect reliability more seriously than others.
D1-45	 In the realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, a creature of the deep sea, showcases an intriguing spectacle. Equipped with light-producing organs called photophores, they emit a soft glow to camouflage, communicate, or lure prey in the pitch-black abyss. Their light is a product of a chemical reaction involving a protein called luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase. This bioluminescent phenomenon is not only a mesmerizing display of nature's complexity but also a fascinating subject for scientific research, offering insights into protein function, evolution, and the adaptations necessary for survival in extreme environments.
D1-46	We present the first numerical simulation of actin-driven propulsion by elastic filaments. Specifically, we use a Brownian dynamics formulation of the dendritic nucleation model of actin-driven propulsion. We show that the model leads to a self-assembled network that exerts forces on a disk and pushes it with an average speed. This simulation approach is the first to observe a speed that varies non-monotonically with the concentration of branching proteins (Arp2/3), capping protein and depolymerization rate (ADF), in accord with experimental observations. Our results suggest a new interpretation of the origin of motility that can be tested readily by experiment.
D1-47	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA polymerase stands as a pivotal enzyme, facilitating the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) during cell division. This essential protein reads the template strand of DNA, deciphering the nucleotide sequence, and subsequently adds complementary nucleotides to the growing strand, ensuring the fidelity of genetic information through a process known as DNA replication. The synthesis process is initiated at the priming stage, where a short RNA primer is generated to establish the point of origin, followed by elongation, where the polymerase extends the RNA primer on the leading strand and synthesizes new Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. The precise function of DNA polymerase in replicating the genetic blueprint of life underscores its paramount importance in maintaining cellular integrity and propagation.
D1-48	Cells swimming in confined environments are attracted by surfaces. We measure the steady-state distribution of smooth-swimming bacteria (Escherichia coli) between two glass plates. In agreement with earlier studies, we find a strong increase of the cell concentration at the boundaries. We demonstrate theoretically that hydrodynamic interactions of the swimming cells with solid surfaces lead to their re-orientation in the direction parallel to the surfaces, as well as their attraction by the closest wall. A model is derived for the steady-state distribution of swimming cells, which compares favorably with our measurements. We exploit our data to estimate the flagellar propulsive force in swimming E. coli.

D1-50	Reciprocal movement cannot be used for locomotion at low-Reynolds number in an infinite fluid or near a rigid surface. Here we show that this limitation is relaxed for a body performing reciprocal motions near a deformable interface. Using physical arguments and scaling relationships, we show that the nonlinearities arising from reciprocal flow-induced interfacial deformation rectify the periodic motion of the swimmer, leading to locomotion. Such a strategy can be used to move toward, away from, and parallel to any deformable interface as long as the length scales involved are smaller than intrinsic scales, which we identify. A macro-scale experiment of flapping motion near a free surface illustrates this new result.
D1-51	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating development is the advent of gene editing through CRISPR-Cas9 technology. This revolutionary tool allows for precise modifications of DNA sequences within an organism, opening doors to countless possibilities. From curing genetic diseases to enhancing crop resistance, the implications are vast and transformative. However, ethical considerations loom large, as debates arise over the potential for designing enhanced human beings or even creating entirely new species. Balancing the excitement of scientific advancement with the responsibility of ethical stewardship will be crucial in navigating this promising, yet potentially perilous, frontier of genetic engineering.
D1-52	Excitable membranes are an important type of nonlinear dynamical system and their study can be used to provide a connection between physical and biological circuits. We discuss two models of excitable membranes important in cardiac and neural tissues. One model is based on the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations and the other is based on a three-transistor excitable circuit. We construct a circuit that simulates reentrant tachycardia and its treatment by surgical ablation. This project is appropriate for advanced undergraduates as a laboratory capstone project, or as a senior thesis or honors project, and can also be a collaborative project, with one student responsible for the computational predictions and another for the circuit construction and measurements.
D1-53	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of gene expression assumes paramount importance. Gene expression refers to the process by which information from a gene is used to produce a functional gene product, typically a protein. This process is orchestrated by the genetic code, a sequence of nucleotides within the gene, and the intricate machinery of the cell. Transcription, the initial step, involves the creation of an RNA copy of the gene. Post-transcriptional modifications further refine the RNA molecule, preparing it for translation - the second step in gene expression where the sequence of the RNA is decoded to produce a protein. Regulation of gene expression plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, from growth and development to metabolism and disease, highlighting its profound impact on life at the cellular level.
D1-54	We propose a multi-scale approach to understanding physics related to the ion/proton-beam cancer therapy and calculation of the probability of the DNA damage as a result of irradiation of patients with energetic (up to 430 MeV/u) ions. This approach is inclusive with respect to different scales starting from the long scale defined by the ion stopping followed by a smaller scale defined by secondary electrons and radicals ending with the shortest scale defined by interactions of secondaries with the DNA. We present calculations of the probabilities of single and double strand breaks of the DNA and suggest a way of further elaboration of such calculations.
D1-55	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can subtly alter an organism's traits and predispositions. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found at specific genetic locations, are responsible for diverse phenotypic differences between individuals. SNPs can influence susceptibility to diseases, response to medications, and even behavioral characteristics, offering valuable insights into the complex interplay between genes and environment. Studying SNPs can potentially lead to personalized medicine strategies, tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup, revolutionizing healthcare and treatment options.
D1-56	This paper proposes a novel chaotic reaction-diffusion model of cellular tumor growth and metastasis. The model is based on the multiscale diffusion cancer-invasion model (MDCM) and formulated by introducing strong nonlinear coupling into the MDCM. The new model exhibits temporal chaotic behavior (which resembles the classical Lorenz strange attractor) and yet retains all the characteristics of the MDCM diffusion model. It mathematically describes both the processes of carcinogenesis and metastasis, as well as the sensitive dependence of cancer evolution on initial conditions and parameters. On the basis of this chaotic tumor-growth model, a generic concept of carcinogenesis and metastasis is formulated.   Keywords: reaction-diffusion tumor growth model, chaotic attractor, sensitive dependence on initial tumor characteristics
D1-57	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis serves as a vital engine, driving the production of organic matter on Earth. This process occurs primarily in green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, transforming sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions, where energy from sunlight is captured and stored, and the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, where carbon dioxide is converted into glucose. This fascinating biochemical dance not only sustains all life on our planet but also plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.
D1-58	We investigate the evolution of populations of random Boolean networks under selection for robustness of the dynamics with respect to the perturbation of the state of a node. The fitness landscape contains a huge plateau of maximum fitness that spans the entire network space. When selection is so strong that it dominates over drift, the evolutionary process is accompanied by a slow increase in the mean connectivity and a slow decrease in the mean fitness. Populations evolved with higher mutation rates show a higher robustness under mutations. This means that even though all the evolved populations exist close to the plateau of maximum fitness, they end up in different regions of network space.
D1-59	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating phenomenon unfolds: epigenetics. This field delves into modifications that alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. Environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and age, can cause these modifications, leading to changes in cellular function. Epigenetic mechanisms, like DNA methylation and histone modification, act as a bridge between nature and nurture, providing a dynamic understanding of how our environment shapes our genetic expression and, in turn, our biological traits. This area of study holds immense potential for understanding complex diseases, as well as for the development of personalized treatment strategies that consider an individual's unique epigenetic landscape.
D1-60	We consider the application of Kramers theory to the microscopic calculation of rates of conformational transitions of macromolecules. The main difficulty in such an approach is to locate the transition state in a huge configuration space. We present a method which identifies the transition state along the most probable reaction pathway. It is then possible to microscopically compute the activation energy, the damping coefficient, the eigenfrequencies at the transition state and obtain the rate, without any a-priori choice of a reaction coordinate. Our theoretical results are tested against the results of Molecular Dynamics simulations for transitions in a 2-dimensional double well and for the cis-trans isomerization of a linear molecule.
D1-61	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis assumes a pivotal role. This biological process, executed by plants and some microorganisms, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis, in essence, is the engine that powers our planet, providing the essential energy needed for life's survival. The oxygen produced is vital for respiration, supporting the existence of countless organisms, while the glucose serves as a primary energy source. This symbiotic exchange between the biosphere and photosynthesis not only sustains life but also regulates Earth's carbon dioxide levels, maintaining a delicate balance essential for our planet's health.
D1-62	Voltage-gated ion channels are key molecules for the generation and propagation of electrical signals in excitable cell membranes. The voltage-dependent switching of these channels between conducting and nonconducting states is a major factor in controlling the transmembrane voltage. In this study, a statistical mechanics model of these molecules has been discussed on the basis of a two-dimensional spin model. A new Hamiltonian and a new Monte Carlo simulation algorithm are introduced to simulate such a model. It was shown that the results well match the experimental data obtained from batrachotoxin-modified sodium channels in the squid giant axon using the cut-open axon technique.
D1-63	 In marine ecosystems, the vibrant kelp forests, teeming with life, serve as an intricate network of biodiversity. These underwater forests, dominated by giant kelp, provide a crucial habitat for numerous species. From the playful sea otters that float on their backs, cracking open kelp stems for food, to the diverse range of fish, invertebrates, and even birds that find shelter among the swaying fronds, kelp forests support a vast array of marine life. They also act as a significant carbon sink, helping to mitigate climate change. However, these delicate ecosystems face threats, including overfishing, pollution, and climate change itself, making their preservation essential for maintaining a healthy and diverse ocean.
D1-64	The purpose of this article is to show how the isotropy subgroup of leaf permutations on binary trees can be used to systematically identify tree-informative invariants relevant to models of phylogenetic evolution. In the quartet case, we give an explicit construction of the full set of representations and describe their properties. We apply these results directly to Markov invariants, thereby extending previous theoretical results by systematically identifying linear combinations that vanish for a given quartet. We also note that the theory is fully generalizable to arbitrary trees and is equally applicable to the related case of phylogenetic invariants. All results follow from elementary consideration of the representation theory of finite groups.
D1-65	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a pivotal process, ensuring the faithful duplication of genetic material during cell division. This intricate dance of proteins, enzymes, and nucleotides initiates at the origin of replication, a specific site on the DNA helix. The helicase unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork. The single strands serve as templates for the assembly of new DNA strands, facilitated by the polymerase enzymes. The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments. Proofreading by the 3' to 5' exonuclease activity of the polymerase, and the action of the DNA ligase, join the Okazaki fragments together, completing the replication process. This remarkable, well-orchestrated event ensures the preservation and transmission of genetic information from one generation of cells to the next.
D1-66	"Rigidity analysis using the ""pebble game"" can usefully be applied to protein crystal structures to obtain information on protein folding, assembly and the structure-function relationship. However, previous work using this technique has not made clear how sensitive rigidity analysis is to small structural variations. We present a comparative study in which rigidity analysis is applied to multiple structures, derived from different organisms and different conditions of crystallisation, for each of several different proteins. We find that rigidity analysis is best used as a comparative tool to highlight the effects of structural variation. Our use of multiple protein structures brings out a previously unnoticed peculiarity in the rigidity of trypsin."
D1-67	 In the realm of microbiology, bacteria serve as the tiny titans, shaping our world in ways unimaginable. They inhabit diverse ecosystems, from the deepest oceans to the driest deserts, thriving in conditions that would be lethal to most life forms. Bacteria are not mere parasites. they are essential to life as we know it. They break down waste, cycle nutrients, and play pivotal roles in food production, medicine, and even climate regulation. Their genetic adaptability, inherent resilience, and extraordinary diversity make them formidable agents of evolution, continually challenging our understanding of life. These microscopic organisms, often overlooked, are indeed indispensable cogs in the grand machinery of life on Earth.
D1-68	We study a simplified, solvable model of a fully-connected metabolic network with constrained quenched disorder to mimic the conservation laws imposed by stoichiometry on chemical reactions. Within a spin-glass type of approach, we show that in presence of a conserved metabolic pool the flux state corresponding to maximal growth is stationary independently of the pool size. In addition, and at odds with the case of unconstrained networks, the volume of optimal flux configurations remains finite, indicating that the frustration imposed by stoichiometric constraints, while reducing growth capabilities, confers robustness and flexibility to the system. These results have a clear biological interpretation and provide a basic, fully analytical explanation to features recently observed in real metabolic networks.
D1-69	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system revolutionizes gene editing, offering a precise and efficient tool for modifying DNA sequences. This revolutionary technology, derived from bacteria's immune response, functions by using short RNA sequences to guide the Cas9 enzyme to specific target sites within the genome. Once there, the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA, enabling scientists to introduce desired changes, correct genetic mutations, or even disable harmful genes. The implications of CRISPR-Cas9 are vast, ranging from treating genetic diseases to enhancing agricultural productivity and even potentially eradicating infectious diseases. This groundbreaking technology, however, raises ethical questions about genetic modification and its potential impact on humanity and the environment.
D1-70	"How might systematic left-right (L/R) asymmetry of the body plan originate in multicellular animals (and plants)? Somehow, the microscopic handedness of biological molecules must be brought up to macroscopic scales. Basic symmetry principles suggest that the usual ""biological"" mechanisms -- diffusion and gene regulation -- are insufficient to implement the ""right-hand rule"" defining a third body axis from the other two. Instead, on the cellular level, ""physical"" mechanisms (forces and collective dynamic states) are needed involving the long stiff fibers of the cytoskeleton. I discuss some possible scenarios. only in the case of vertebrate internal organs is the answer currently known (and even that is in dispute)."
D1-71	 In the intricate realm of cellular biology, mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell, play a pivotal role. They are responsible for converting nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency for cellular processes. Mitochondria's dual membrane structure, consisting of an outer and inner membrane, houses a complex set of enzymes that facilitate this energy conversion process. Interestingly, mitochondria were once free-living organisms that evolved to live symbiotically within eukaryotic cells billions of years ago. This symbiotic relationship dramatically changed the course of life on Earth, enabling the development of complex, multicellular organisms. Today, understanding mitochondria's functions and dynamics remains a fascinating area of ongoing research in the pursuit of unlocking the mysteries of life.
D1-72	The classification of life should be based upon the fundamental mechanism in the evolution of life. We found that the global relationships among species should be circular phylogeny, which is quite different from the common sense based upon phylogenetic trees. The genealogical circles can be observed clearly according to the analysis of protein length distributions of contemporary species. Thus, we suggest that domains can be defined by distinguished phylogenetic circles, which are global and stable characteristics of living systems. The mechanism in genome size evolution has been clarified. hence main component questions on C-value enigma can be explained. According to the correlations and quasi-periodicity of protein length distributions, we can also classify life into three domains.
D1-73	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, or firefly squid, exhibits a distinct, captivating display of light. Found in the deep sea, this cephalopod emits flashes of blue, green, or red hues as a means of communication, camouflage, or attracting prey. Its light-producing organ, the photophore, contains a chemical reaction that generates light when oxygen and a luciferin-luciferase complex are activated, resulting in quick, flickering bursts. This creature's mesmerizing display not only captivates researchers but also offers insights into the intricate world of deep-sea adaptations.
D1-74	The analysis of the ultrasonic frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient of aggregating red blood cells reveals information about blood structural properties. The difficulty to apply this technique in vivo is due to the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by intervening tissue layers that distorts the spectral content of backscattering properties from blood microstructures. An optimization method is proposed to simultaneously estimate tissue attenuation and blood structure factor. In an in vitro experiment, the method gave satisfactory estimates with relative errors below 22% for attenuations between 0.101 and 0.317 dB/cm/MHz, signal-to-noise ratios>28 dB and kR<2.7 (k being the wave number and R the aggregate radius).
D1-75	 In the intricate realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a testament to nature's ingenuity. This process, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy, storing it in the form of glucose. This essential process not only fuels the organisms themselves but also forms the basis of life on Earth by producing oxygen as a byproduct. Photosynthesis, in essence, is the life-sustaining dance between sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, a harmonious symphony of energy transformation that underpins the very existence of our planet's ecosystems.
D1-76	Pyro-Align is a multiple alignment program specifically designed for pyrosequencing reads of huge number. Multiple sequence alignment is shown to be NP-hard and heuristics are designed for approximate solutions. Multiple sequence alignment of pyrosequenceing reads is complex mainly because of 2 factors. One being the huge number of reads, making the use of traditional heuristics,that scale very poorly for large number, unsuitable. The second reason is that the alignment cannot be performed arbitrarily, because the position of the reads with respect to the original genome is important and has to be taken into account.In this report we present a short description of the multiple alignment system for pyrosequencing reads.
D1-77	 In the realm of genetic engineering, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool, has emerged as a game-changer. This innovative system, derived from bacterial immune defenses, enables precise modifications of DNA sequences. By targeting specific genes, researchers can correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, or even disable harmful ones. The implications of this technology stretch across various fields, from agriculture to medicine, potentially eradicating genetic diseases or improving crop yield, and even paving the way for personalized medicine. However, ethical considerations loom large, as the manipulation of human genes could alter the very fabric of human existence, necessitating thoughtful deliberation and regulation.
D1-78	Inspired by problems in biochemical kinetics, we study statistical properties of an overdamped Langevin process whose friction coefficient depends on the state of a similar, unobserved process. Integrating out the latter, we derive the long time behaviour of the mean square displacement. Anomalous diffusion is found. Since the diffusion exponent can not be predicted using a simple scaling argument, anomalous scaling appears as well. We also find that the coupling can lead to ergodic or non-ergodic behaviour of the studied process. We compare our theoretical predictions with numerical simulations and find an excellent agreement. The findings caution against treating biochemical systems coupled with unobserved dynamical degrees of freedom by means of standard, diffusive Langevin descriptions.
D1-79	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This process, primarily carried out by chloroplasts in green plants, algae, and some bacteria, is essential for the survival of virtually all life forms on Earth. Photosynthesis not only provides energy in the form of glucose but also oxygen, a vital component required for respiration in most organisms. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthesis and respiration maintains Earth's oxygen-carbon dioxide balance, ensuring the continued existence of diverse life forms. The efficiency of photosynthesis, however, is influenced by various factors, including light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration, making it a fascinating subject of study in the field of biology.
D1-80	Finding and sampling multiple reaction channels for molecular transitions remains an important challenge in physical chemistry. Here we show that the weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling method can readily sample multiple channels. In a first test, both the WE and transition path sampling methods are applied to two-dimensional model potentials. The comparison explains why the weighted ensemble approach will not be trapped in one channel. The WE approach is then used to sample the full transition path ensemble in implicitly solvated alanine dipeptide at two different temperatures. The ensembles are of sufficient quality to permit quantification of the fractional importance of each channel, even at T=300K when brute-force simulation is prohibitively expensive.
D1-81	 In the intricate world of marine biology, the delicate balance of life relies heavily on the symbiotic relationships between various species. A prime example is the relationship between sea anemones and clownfish. The sea anemone, a stationary, stinging polyp, provides a protective home for the clownfish with its venomous tentacles deterring predators. In exchange, the clownfish clean the anemone's mouth and tentacles, helping to keep them free of parasites and debris. This mutually beneficial partnership is a testament to the complexity and interconnectedness of life beneath the ocean's surface.
D1-82	We investigate irreversibility and dissipation in single molecules that cooperatively fold/unfold in a two state manner under the action of mechanical force. We apply path thermodynamics to derive analytical expressions for the average dissipated work and the average hopping number in two state systems. It is shown how these quantities only depend on two parameters that characterize the folding/unfolding kinetics of the molecule: the fragility and the coexistence hopping rate. The latter has to be rescaled to take into account the appropriate experimental setup. Finally we carry out pulling experiments with optical tweezers in a specifically designed DNA hairpin that shows two-state cooperative folding. We then use these experimental results to validate our theoretical predictions.
D1-83	 In the realm of microbiology, bacteriophages, or phages, are fascinating entities. These are viruses that infect bacteria, a naturally occurring phenomenon that serves as a potential solution to antibiotic resistance. Phages, much like their macroscopic counterparts, exhibit diversity in structure and function. They possess unique DNA or RNA genomes, encased within a protein shell. Once attached to a host bacterium, they inject their genetic material, commandeering the cellular machinery to produce more phages. This replication process ultimately leads to the bacterium's demise, offering a promising avenue for targeted, biodegradable, and resistant-proof bacterial therapy.
D1-84	Large protein assemblies, such as virus capsids, may be coarse-grained as a set of rigid domains linked by generalized (rotational and stretching) harmonic springs. We present a method to obtain the elastic parameters and overdamped dynamics for these springs from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of one pair of domains at a time. The computed relaxation times of this pair give a consistency check for the simulation, and (using a fluctuation-dissipation relationship) we find the corrective force needed to null systematic drifts. As a first application we predict the stiffness of an HIV capsid layer and the relaxation time for its breathing mode.
D1-85	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can exert profound influence. These minute differences in DNA sequences, often found at various genetic loci, are responsible for the diversity we witness among species, including humans. Each SNP, like a unique fingerprint, contributes to a complex tapestry of traits, from eye color to susceptibility to certain diseases. However, the intricacy lies in deciphering the role of each SNP in the grand scheme of life, a challenge that bioinformatics and genomic research continue to grapple with, promising a deeper understanding of our genetic heritage.
D1-86	We introduce a robust, error-tolerant adaptive training algorithm for generalized learning paradigms in high-dimensional superposed quantum networks, or \emph{adaptive quantum networks}. The formalized procedure applies standard backpropagation training across a coherent ensemble of discrete topological configurations of individual neural networks, each of which is formally merged into appropriate linear superposition within a predefined, decoherence-free subspace. Quantum parallelism facilitates simultaneous training and revision of the system within this coherent state space, resulting in accelerated convergence to a stable network attractor under consequent iteration of the implemented backpropagation algorithm. Parallel evolution of linear superposed networks incorporating backpropagation training provides quantitative, numerical indications for optimization of both single-neuron activation functions and optimal reconfiguration of whole-network quantum structure.
D1-87	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating intersection between genes and environment. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. These adjustments can be influenced by various factors, including age, disease, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment offers a profound understanding of how external factors can shape our biological traits and health outcomes, suggesting a new frontier in personalized medicine and disease prevention strategies.
D1-88	Morphogen profiles play a vital role in biology by specifying position in embryonic development. However, the factors that influence the shape of a morphogen profile remain poorly understood. Since morphogens should provide precise positional information, one significant factor is the robustness of the profile to noise. We compare three classes of morphogen profiles (linear, exponential, algebraic) to see which is most precise when subject to both external embryo-to-embryo fluctuations and internal fluctuations due to intrinsically random processes such as diffusion. We find that both the kinetic parameters and the overall gradient shape (e.g. exponential versus algebraic) can be optimised to generate maximally precise positional information.
D1-89	 In the realm of genetics, the mysterious CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized biology. This revolutionary tool, a product of bacterial immune defense, functions as a precise molecular scissor, capable of snipping DNA at specific locations. By engineering guide RNAs, scientists can manipulate the genetic code, correcting errors, or introducing novel traits. This technology holds immense potential, promising treatments for genetic diseases, fostering crop improvement, and even combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, its swift rise has also sparked ethical debates, as questions regarding the boundaries of human intervention loom large. As we navigate this genetic frontier, we must strive to balance progress with responsibility.
D1-90	We present a rigorous procedure to derive coarse-grained red blood cell (RBC) models, which lead to accurate mechanical properties of realistic RBCs. Based on a semi-analytic theory linear and non-linear elastic properties of the RBC membrane can be matched with those obtained in optical tweezers stretching experiments. In addition, we develop a nearly stress-free model which avoids a number of pitfalls of existing RBC models, such as non-biconcave equilibrium shape and dependence of RBC mechanical properties on the triangulation quality. The proposed RBC model is suitable for use in many existing numerical methods, such as Lattice Boltzmann, Multiparticle Collision Dynamics, Immersed Boundary, etc.
D1-91	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can exert substantial effects, subtly altering an organism's traits. These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring at specific locations, often go unnoticed yet play pivotal roles in determining characteristics, susceptibility to diseases, or responses to drugs. For instance, a SNP in the human beta-globin gene can cause sickle cell anemia, while another in the APOE gene is linked to Alzheimer's disease. These SNPs, when studied collectively, offer valuable insights into genetic inheritance patterns and human health, underscoring the profound impact of our genetic code on our wellbeing.
D1-92	We construct a tractable model to describe the rate at which a knotted polymer is ejected from a spherical capsid via a small pore. Knots are too large to fit through the pore and must reptate to the end of the polymer for ejection to occur. The reptation of knots is described by symmetric exclusion on the line, with the internal capsid pressure represented by an additional biased particle that drives knots to the end of the chain. We compute the exact ejection speed for a finite number of knots L and find that it scales as 1/L. We also construct a continuum theory for many knots that matches the exact discrete theory for large L.
D1-93	 In the intricate landscape of marine ecosystems, the bioluminescent jellyfish stands as a beacon of nature's mystique. These ethereal creatures, inhabiting the deepest ocean trenches to the sun-kissed surface, illuminate the dark with an otherworldly glow. Bioluminescence is their defense mechanism, a soft, pulsating light that deters predators. The light is produced by a chemical reaction within their bodies, emitting a cold, blue-green hue. This luminous display not only fascinates researchers but also offers insights into the complexities of life on Earth. As we continue to explore these gelatinous wonders, we unravel more secrets about the intricate dance of life beneath the waves.
D1-94	The structure of networks that provide optimal transport properties has been investigated in a variety of contexts. While many different formulations of this problem have been considered, it is recurrently found that optimal networks are trees. It is shown here that this result is contingent on the assumption of a stationary flow through the network. When time variations or fluctuations are allowed for, a different class of optimal structures is found, which share the hierarchical organization of trees yet contain loops. The transitions between different network topologies as the parameters of the problem vary are examined. These results may have strong implications for the structure and formation of natural networks, as is illustrated by the example of leaf venation networks.
D1-95	 In marine ecosystems, the role of phytoplankton, microscopic algae, is pivotal. Floating in the ocean's upper layer, they photosynthesize, transforming sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients into oxygen and organic matter. This process supports a vast food web, providing sustenance for zooplankton, small fish, and larger marine life. Phytoplankton also play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, absorbing significant amounts of CO2, which helps mitigate climate change. However, their survival is threatened by ocean acidification, warming, and pollution, posing a concern for the health and balance of marine ecosystems.
D1-96	We demonstrate that demographic noise can induce persistent spatial pattern formation and temporal oscillations in the Levin-Segel predator-prey model for plankton-herbivore population dynamics. Although the model exhibits a Turing instability in mean field theory, demographic noise greatly enlarges the region of parameter space where pattern formation occurs. To distinguish between patterns generated by fluctuations and those present at the mean field level in real ecosystems, we calculate the power spectrum in the noise-driven case and predict the presence of fat tails not present in the mean field case. These results may account for the prevalence of large-scale ecological patterns, beyond that expected from traditional non-stochastic approaches.
D1-97	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, primarily carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, transforms sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process not only fuels the organisms performing it but also supplies the world with oxygen, essential for most life on Earth. Photosynthesis's efficiency can be influenced by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration, making it a vital component in understanding and predicting global ecological patterns.
D1-98	A novel model of biological organisms is advanced, treating an organism as a self-consistent system subject to a pathogen flux. The principal novelty of the model is that it describes not some parts, but a biological organism as a whole. The organism is modeled by a five-dimensional dynamical system. The organism homeostasis is described by the evolution equations for five interacting components: healthy cells, ill cells, innate immune cells, specific immune cells, and pathogens. The stability analysis demonstrates that, in a wide domain of the parameter space, the system exhibits robust structural stability. There always exist four stable stationary solutions characterizing four qualitatively differing states of the organism: alive state, boundary state, critical state, and dead state.
D1-99	 In the realm of genetics, epigenetics emerges as a fascinating subdiscipline. Unlike DNA sequencing, which remains static throughout an organism's life, epigenetics encompasses modifications that alter gene expression without changing the actual DNA sequence. These modifications, such as methylation and histone modification, play a crucial role in cellular functions, including development, aging, and disease susceptibility. Epigenetic changes can occur due to environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and even stress, underscoring the intricate interplay between our genetic makeup and external influences on our health and well-being. This burgeoning field holds immense potential for understanding complex diseases and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.
D1-100	It has been proven that the accessibility of the target sites has a critical influence for miRNA and siRNA. In this paper, we present a program, rip2.0, not only the energetically most favorable targets site based on the hybrid-probability, but also a statistical sampling structure to illustrate the statistical characterization and representation of the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA-RNA interaction structures. The outputs are retrieved via backtracing an improved dynamic programming solution for the partition function based on the approach of Huang et al. (Bioinformatics). The $O(N^6)$ time and $O(N^4)$ space algorithm is implemented in C (available from \url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/rip2.html})
D1-101	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool, has unveiled unprecedented possibilities. This gene-editing technology, derived from bacterial immunity mechanisms, allows precise manipulation of DNA sequences. By correcting genetic mutations or inserting new DNA, scientists can alter an organism's traits, potentially eradicating diseases or enhancing crops for food security. However, ethical considerations loom large as we tread into uncharted territory, questioning the implications of designing 'designer babies' or altering the very essence of life itself. As we navigate this genetic frontier, striking a balance between scientific advancement and ethical responsibility becomes crucial.
D1-102	We introduce a new way to study molecular evolution within well-established Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, showing that for a broad class of fitness landscapes it is possible to derive dynamics analytically within the $1/N$-accuracy, where $N$ is genome length. For smooth and monotonic fitness function this approach gives two dynamical phases: smooth dynamics, and discontinuous dynamics. The latter phase arises naturally with no explicit singular fitness function, counter-intuitively. The Hamilton-Jacobi method yields straightforward analytical results for the models that utilize fitness as a function of Hamming distance from a reference genome sequence. We also show the way in which this method gives dynamical phase structure for multi-peak fitness.
D1-103	 Nitrogen fixation, an essential biological process, is primarily carried out by symbiotic bacteria like Rhizobium and non-symbiotic bacteria such as Azotobacter. These microorganisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form, ammonia, through a complex reduction process. This process is crucial for the nitrogen cycle and the overall health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as it provides nitrogen, a fundamental nutrient for plant growth, that would otherwise be unavailable to most organisms. This transformation plays a pivotal role in agriculture, as it reduces the need for artificial fertilizers and promotes sustainable farming practices.
D1-104	We consider the optimal dynamics in the infinite population evolution models with general symmetric fitness landscape. The search of optimal evolution trajectories are complicated due to sharp transitions (like shock waves) in evolution dynamics with smooth fitness landscapes, which exist even in case of popular quadratic fitness. We found exact analytical solutions for discontinuous dynamics at the large genome length limit.   We found the optimal mutation rates for the fixed fitness landscape. The single peak fitness landscape gives the fastest dynamics to send the vast majority of the population from the initial sequence to the neighborhood of the final sequence.
D1-105	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics is a captivating field of study. It delves into the modifications that alter gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily methylation and acetylation, are influenced by various factors such as age, environment, and lifestyle choices. Epigenetic changes have been linked to disease development, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and even mental health conditions. The study of epigenetics promises a deeper understanding of hereditary and environmental influences on health and disease, potentially opening doors for novel therapeutic strategies. This area of biology underscores the complex interplay between our genes and the environment, emphasizing that our lifestyle choices can have profound effects on our health.
D1-106	Recent advances in biochemical computing, i.e., information processing with cascades of primarily enzymatic reactions realizing computing gates, such as AND, OR, etc., as well as progress in networking these gates and coupling of the resulting systems to smart/responsive electrodes for output readout, have opened new biosensing opportunities. Here we survey existing enabling research results, as well as ideas and research avenues for future development of a new paradigm of digitally operating biosensors logically processing multiple biochemical signals through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular reactions, yielding the final output signals as YES/NO responses. Such systems can lead to high-fidelity biosensing compared to common single or parallel sensing devices.
D1-107	 In marine ecosystems, the life cycle of the giant kelp (Macrocyystis pyrifera) plays a pivotal role. This brown alga grows rapidly in nutrient-rich ocean waters, forming vast underwater forests. The kelp's reproductive strategy is unique, with small, buoyant spores drifting on ocean currents. Upon reaching suitable conditions, these spores germinate into tiny, filamentous stages called gametophytes. These then develop into floating, egg-producing male or sperm-producing female gametophytes. Fertilization occurs when spermatia from male gametophytes meet and fuse with eggs from female gametophytes. The resulting zygote develops into a sporophyte, the familiar large, bladed kelp that we see in the sea. This complex life cycle, involving alternation of generations between the gametophyte and sporophyte stages, encourages survival and rapid growth of the giant kelp, maintaining the health of kelp forests and supporting diverse marine life.
D1-108	Many physical and chemical processes, such as folding of biopolymers, are best described as dynamics on large combinatorial energy landscapes. A concise approximate description of dynamics is obtained by partitioning the micro-states of the landscape into macro-states. Since most landscapes of interest are not tractable analytically, the probabilities of transitions between macro-states need to be extracted numerically from the microscopic ones, typically by full enumeration of the state space. Here we propose to approximate transition probabilities by a Markov chain Monte-Carlo method. For landscapes of the number partitioning problem and an RNA switch molecule we show that the method allows for accurate probability estimates with significantly reduced computational cost.
D1-109	 In botany, photosynthesis is the primary process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in carbohydrate molecules. This essential biochemical reaction takes place in specialized cell organelles called chloroplasts, within the plant cells. The fundamental equation of photosynthesis is:6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2This process not only produces glucose for the plant's growth and energy needs but also releases oxygen, a vital component for most forms of life on our planet. Photosynthesis is a delicate balance of various photochemical reactions, with the Calvin cycle and the light-dependent reactions working in harmony to sustain life on Earth.
D1-110	Microtubules are filament-shaped, polymeric proteins (~25 nm in diameter) involved in cellular structure and organization. We demonstrate the imaging of individual microtubules using a conventional bright-field microscope, without any additional phase or polarization optics. Light scattered by microtubules is discriminated through extensive use of digital image-processing, thus removing background, reducing noise and enhancing contrast. The setup builds on a commercial microscope, with the inclusion of a minimal and inexpensive set of components, suitable for implementation in the student laboratory. We show how this technique can be applied to a demonstrative biophysical assay, by tracking the motions of microtubules driven by the motor protein kinesin.
D1-111	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal act. This process, performed by green plants and some microorganisms, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This transformation is facilitated by chlorophyll, a pigment found within the plant's cells. The oxygen produced is essential for aerobic respiration in most living organisms, while the glucose serves as an energy source for the plant itself. Photosynthesis, therefore, is a cornerstone of life on Earth, fostering a symbiotic relationship between flora and fauna, and underpinning the global carbon cycle.
D1-112	The system of partial differential equations describing tumor-immune dynamics with angiogenesis taken into account is presented. For spatially homogeneous case, the steady state analysis of the model is carried out. The effects of single photodynamic impact are numerically simulated. In the case of strong immune response we found that the photodynamic therapy (PDT) gives rise to the substantial shrinkage of tumor size which is accompanied by the increase of interleukin-2 concentration. On the contrary, the photodynamic stimulation of weak immune response is shown to be insufficient to reduce the tumor. These findings indicate the important role of anti-cancer immune response in the long-term tumor control after PDT.
D1-113	 In the realm of molecular biology, the genetic code is the fundamental language that dictates the synthesis of proteins from DNA. This code, consisting of three nucleotide bases, is translated into amino acids by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules within ribosomes. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon that binds to a specific codon on the messenger RNA (mRNA) template, ensuring precise translation of the genetic information.

The intricate dance of proteins, DNA, RNA, and enzymes forms the backbone of life, orchestrating growth, development, and reproduction in all organisms.
D1-114	The problem of DNA-DNA interaction mediated by divalent counterions is studied using computer simulation. Although divalent counterions cannot condense free DNA molecules in solution, we show that if DNA configurational entropy is restricted, divalent counterions can cause DNA reentrant condensation similar to that caused by tri- or tetra-valent counterions. DNA-DNA interaction is strongly repulsive at small or large counterion concentration and is negligible or slightly attractive for a concentration in between. Implications of our results to experiments of DNA ejection from bacteriophages are discussed. The quantitative result serves to understand electrostatic effects in other experiments involving DNA and divalent counterions.

The emergence of this new mesophase dramatically alters the statistics of electrostatic fluctuations at the protein/water interface. The linear-response relation between the average electrostatic potential and its variance breaks down, with the breadth of the electrostatic noise far exceeding the expectations of the linear response theories. The dynamics of these non-Gaussian electrostatic fluctuations are dominated by a slow (~ 1 ns) component which freezes in at the temperature of dynamical transition of proteins.

Each DNA strand, a complex code of four bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - forms the blueprint for every living organism. Mutations, changes in these bases, can lead to genetic variations and, ultimately, the development of new species. However, it's not just the sequence that matters. the way these sequences are read, regulated, and expressed is equally crucial. The intersection of genetics and epigenetics, the study of how external factors influence gene expression, further complicates this vast and fascinating field. As we continue to unravel these mysteries, our understanding of life's diversity and evolution deepens, offering promise for targeted therapies and potential solutions to some of humanity's most pressing challenges.
D1-120	Intracellular transmission of information via chemical and transcriptional networks is thwarted by a physical limitation: the finite copy number of the constituent chemical species introduces unavoidable intrinsic noise. Here we provide a method for solving for the complete probabilistic description of intrinsically noisy oscillatory driving. We derive and numerically verify a number of simple scaling laws. Unlike in the case of measuring a static quantity, response to an oscillatory driving can exhibit a resonant frequency which maximizes information transmission. Further, we show that the optimal regulatory design is dependent on the biophysical constraints (i.e., the allowed copy number and response time). The resulting phase diagram illustrates under what conditions threshold regulation outperforms linear regulation.

Epigenetics, a layer above DNA sequencing, influences gene expression without altering the DNA code itself. It's a complex interplay of molecules that modify chromatin, DNA methylation, and histone proteins, ultimately deciding which genes are 'on' or 'off'. This dynamic process is susceptible to environmental factors like diet, stress, and toxins, suggesting a potential link between lifestyle and disease susceptibility. Epigenetics, therefore, opens new avenues for understanding and potentially intervening in hereditary diseases and conditions influenced by lifestyle choices.

Multi channel univariate amplitude analyses are performed and it is shown that time dependent Shannon entropies can be used to predict focal epileptic seizure onsets in different epileptogenic brain zones of different patients. Formations or time evolutions of the synchronizations in the brain signals from epileptogenic or non epileptogenic areas of the patients in ictal interval or inter-ictal interval are further investigated employing spatial or temporal differences of the entropies.

Although the extinction process is dynamically unstable, it follows an optimal path that maximizes the probability of extinction. We show that the optimal path is also directly related to the finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the underlying dynamical system in that the optimal path displays maximum sensitivity to initial conditions. We consider several stochastic epidemic models, and examine the extinction process in a dynamical systems framework. Using the dynamics of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents as a constructive tool, we demonstrate that the dynamical systems viewpoint of extinction evolves naturally toward the optimal path.

D1-128	We study synchronization of locally coupled noisy phase oscillators which move diffusively in a one-dimensional ring. Together with the disordered and the globally synchronized states, the system also exhibits several wave-like states which display local order. We use a statistical description valid for a large number of oscillators to show that for any finite system there is a critical spatial diffusion above which all wave-like solutions become unstable. Through Langevin simulations, we show that the transition to global synchronization is mediated by the relative size of attractor basins associated to wave-like states. Spatial diffusion disrupts these states and paves the way for the system to attain global synchronization.

We have considered two different interaction scenarios, one in which the neurons are diffusively coupled and another in which the neurons interact via pulse-like signals. We found that the type of interaction between the neurons has a crucial role in determining the response of the system to the external modulation. We develop a mean-field theory based on an order parameter expansion that quantitatively reproduces the numerical results in the case of diffusive coupling.
D1-131	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, known as the firefly squid, exhibits an astonishing display of light. Unlike other bioluminescent creatures, it uses light not just for communication or camouflage, but also for hunting. Its eyes, equipped with specialized photoreceptors, can detect even the faintest luminescence. When a prey moves, the squid emits a precise, targeted flash of light, disorienting the prey and making it easier to capture. This remarkable blend of sight and light creates a mesmerizing underwater spectacle, offering a fascinating glimpse into the diverse world of marine life.

We show that the periodicity of the system plays an important role to explain the relevance of the initial state in the transport efficiency. This picture is modified, and the transport enhanced for any initial state, when considering that molecules have different energies, and when including their interaction with the environment. We study this last situation by using stochastic Schr{\""o}dinger equations, both for Markovian and non-Markovian type of interactions."

The results obtained for different simulation parameters have been discussed and compared with experimental measurements of our own and from the literature. The electroosmotic flow of water molecules induced by the ionic current in the different cases has been calculated and interpreted with the help of the hydration properties extracted from the simulations.
D1-135	 In the realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This bio-chemical reaction, performed by green plants and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The equation, while simplified, illustrates this process: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 (oxygen). This conversion not only sustains the life of the organism but also plays a vital role in maintaining Earth's oxygen levels, contributing to the survival of aerobic organisms. Photosynthesis, thus, is a symbiotic relationship between plants and the atmosphere, weaving together the threads of life on our planet.

From the most general definition of autocatalysis, that is a process in which a chemical compound is able to catalyze its own formation, several different systems can be described. We detail the different categories of autocatalyses, and compare them on the basis of their mechanistic, kinetic, and dynamic properties. It is shown how autocatalytic patterns can be generated by different systems of chemical reactions. The notion of autocatalysis covering a large variety of mechanistic realisations with very similar behaviors, it is proposed that the key signature of autocatalysis is its kinetic pattern expressed in a mathematical form.

D1-138	We present theory and experiments for the force-distance curve $F(z_0)$ of an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip (radius $R$) indenting a supported fluid bilayer (thickness $2d$). For realistic conditions the force is dominated by the area compressibility modulus $\kappa_A$ of the bilayer, and, to an excellent approximation, given by $F= \pi \kappa_A R z_0^2/(2d-z_0)^2$. The experimental AFM force curves from coexisting liquid ordered and liquid disordered domains in 3-component lipid bilayers are well-described by our model, and provides $\kappa_A$ in agreement with literature values. The liquid ordered phase has a yield like response that we model by hydrogen bond breaking.

This process is often initiated by exposing bacteria to free-floating DNA fragments in a process called ""transformation by competence"" or ""spontaneous transformation."" The absorbed DNA can alter the recipient bacterium's traits, leading to variations within populations, a fundamental concept in evolution. This transformation, while seemingly simple, is a testament to nature's intricate mechanisms, shaping the diversity we witness in microbial life."
D1-140	We describe the structure of the graphs with the smallest average distance and the largest average clustering given their order and size. There is usually a unique graph with the largest average clustering, which at the same time has the smallest possible average distance. In contrast, there are many graphs with the same minimum average distance, ignoring their average clustering. The form of these graphs is shown with analytical arguments. Finally, we measure the sensitivity to rewiring of this architecture with respect to the clustering coefficient, and we devise a method to make these networks more robust with respect to vertex removal.
D1-141	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a significant player. Epigenetics, simply put, is the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can influence how cells read a DNA sequence, affecting traits like growth, behavior, and disease susceptibility. Epigenetic changes can occur due to various factors like aging, environment, lifestyle, and disease states, proving that our genes are not our destiny, but rather the product of a dynamic interplay between our DNA and the world around us.

We measure the neurons' response to an electric stimulation for gradual lower connectivity, and characterize the size of the giant cluster in the network. The connectivity undergoes a percolation transition described by the critical exponent $\beta \simeq 0.65$. We use a theoretic approach based on bond.percolation on a graph to describe the process of disintegration of the network and extract its statistical properties. Together with numerical simulations we show that the connectivity in the neural culture is local, characterized by a gaussian degree distribution and not a power law on

Quantitative measurements of the pearling instability give a square-root behavior for the wavelength as a function of drug concentration. We present a theory that explains these observations in terms of the interplay between rigidity of the submembranous actin shell and tension that is induced by boundary conditions set by adhesion points. The theory allows estimation of the rigidity and thickness of this supporting shell. The same theoretical considerations explain the shape of nonadherent edges in the general case of untreated cells."

The computation of this cluster p-value for randomly distributed vectors is mapped onto a well-defined problem of statistical mechanics. We solve this problem analytically, establishing a connection between the physics of quenched disorder and multiple testing statistics in clustering and related problems. In an application to gene expression data, we find a remarkable link between the statistical significance of a cluster and the functional relationships between its genes.

Inspired by recent work revisiting some of the early evidence for a L\'evy flight foraging strategy in animals, we analyse datasets on human contact from real world traces. By analysing the distribution of inter-contact times on different time scales and using different graphical forms, we find not only the highly skewed distributions of waiting times highlighted in previous studies but also clear circadian rhythm. The relative visibility of these two components depends strongly on which graphical form is adopted and the range of time scales. We use a simple model to reconstruct the observed behaviour and discuss the implications of this for forwarding efficiency.

D1-152	We study self-propulsion of a half-metal coated colloidal particle under laser irradiation. The motion is caused by self-thermophoresis: i.e. absorption of laser at the metal-coated side of the particle creates local temperature gradient which in turn drives the particle by thermophoresis. To clarify the mechanism, temperature distribution and a thermal slip flow field around a micro-scale Janus particle are measured for the first time. With measured temperature drop across the particle, the speed of self-propulsion is corroborated with the prediction based on accessible parameters.

We here present a generic stochastic model which combines the growth dynamics of the population and its internal evolution. Our model thereby accounts for the fact that both evolutionary and growth dynamics are based on individual reproduction events and hence are highly coupled and stochastic in nature. We exemplify our approach by studying the dilemma of cooperation in growing populations and show that genuinely stochastic events can ease the dilemma by leading to a transient but robust increase in cooperation

D1-162	In this paper we argue that, in addition to electrical and chemical signals propagating in the neurons of the brain, signal propagation takes place in the form of biophoton production. This statement is supported by recent experimental confirmation of photon guiding properties of a single neuron. We have investigated the interaction of mitochondrial biophotons with microtubules from a quantum mechanical point of view. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the interaction of biophotons and microtubules causes transitions/fluctuations of microtubules between coherent and incoherent states. A significant relationship between the fluctuation function of microtubules and alpha-EEG diagrams is elaborated on in this paper. We argue that the role of biophotons in the brain merits special attention.

In particular, there is a domain of parameters in which the dynamics is characterized by the apparition of \blips"", associated here to an instability which develops at high virus reproduction rate. Various possible extensions of this simple model are discussed, in particular in view of its applications in the context of HAART therapy."

Here, we study the dynamics of switching in a generic-feedback on/off switch. Unlike protein-only models, we explicitly account for stochastic fluctuations of mRNA, which have a dramatic impact on switch dynamics. Employing the WKB theory to treat the underlying chemical master equations, we obtain accurate results for the quasi-stationary distributions of mRNA and protein copy numbers and for the mean switching time, starting from either state.

This advancement promises to revolutionize agriculture, medicine, and even conservation efforts, addressing issues like genetic diseases, food security, and environmental sustainability. However, it's crucial to navigate this novel landscape with caution, as ethical, safety, and societal implications demand careful consideration. The future of biology lies in the delicate balance between scientific progress and responsible application of groundbreaking technologies like CRISPR-Cas9.
D1-170	In this work we explore the effects of human mobility on the dispersion of a vector borne disease. We combine an already presented stochastic model for dengue with a simple representation of the daily motion of humans on a schematic city of 20x20 blocks with 100 inhabitants in each block. The pattern of motion of the individuals is described in terms of complex networks in which links connect different blocks and the link length distribution is in accordance with recent findings on human mobility. It is shown that human mobility can turn out to be the main driving force of the disease dispersal.
D1-171	 In the realm of microbiology, probiotics have emerged as valuable allies in human health. These beneficial bacteria, often found in yogurt and other fermented foods, play a crucial role in maintaining digestive balance. By crowding out harmful pathogens, they aid in digestion, boost immune function, and even contribute to mental health by producing neurotransmitters. Probiotics can also alleviate symptoms of certain conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and allergies. However, it's essential to consume probiotics in the right quantities and from reliable sources to ensure they deliver their health benefits effectively.
D1-172	We apply theoretically open-loop quantum optimal control techniques to provide methods for the verification of various quantum coherent transport mechanisms in natural and artificial light-harvesting complexes under realistic experimental constraints. We demonstrate that optimally shaped laser pulses allow to faithfully prepare the photosystem in specified initial states (such as localized excitation or coherent superposition, i.e. propagating and non-propagating states) and to probe efficiently the dynamics. These results provide a path towards the discrimination of the different transport pathways and to the characterization of environmental properties, enhancing our understanding of the role that coherent processes may play in biological complexes.
D1-173	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. This biochemical marvel takes place in chloroplasts, organelles within plant cells. Carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight are the essential ingredients. Through a series of reactions, carbon dioxide is fixed into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This carbon-rich glucose is not only vital for plant growth but also serves as a primary food source for countless organisms, underpinning the web of life on Earth. Photosynthesis, therefore, is not just a biological process. it's a testament to the symbiotic interplay of life forms on our planet, a cycle essential for the perpetuation of life itself.
D1-174	No existing algorithm can start with arbitrary RNA sequences and return the precise, three-dimensional structures that ensures their biological function. This chapter outlines current algorithms for automated RNA structure prediction (including our own FARNA-FARFAR), highlights their successes, and dissects their limitations, using a tetraloop and the sarcin/ricin motif as examples. The barriers to future advances are considered in light of three particular challenges: improving computational sampling, reducing reliance on experimentally solved structures, and avoiding coarse-grained representations of atomic-level interactions. To help meet these challenges and better understand the current state of the field, we propose an ongoing community-wide CASP-style experiment for evaluating the performance of current structure prediction algorithms.
D1-175	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal ballet, the stage set by chloroplasts within plant cells. Carbon dioxide, absorbed from the air, intertwines with water and sunlight, the latter's energy harnessed by pigments like chlorophyll. This union, aided by enzymes, splits water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The resulting organic compounds, primarily glucose, serve as the lifeblood of the plant, fueling growth and reproduction. Simultaneously, oxygen, vital for most aerobic organisms, is released into the atmosphere, completing this symphony of life. This process, a testament to evolution's genius, sustains the biosphere, underpinning the intricate web of life on Earth.
D1-176	We investigate the behavior of a treadmilling microswimmer in a two-dimensional unbounded domain with a semi-infinite no-slip wall. The wall can also be regarded as a probe or pipette inserted into the flow. We solve the governing evolution equations in an analytical form and numerically calculate trajectories of the swimmer for several different initial positions and orientations. We then compute the probability that the treadmilling organism can escape the vicinity of the wall. We find that many trajectories in a 'wedge' around the wall are likely to escape. This suggests that inserting a probe or pipette in a suspension of organism may push away treadmilling swimmers.
D1-177	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single base pair mutation can yield profound consequences. For instance, the sickle cell trait, a genetic variation in the beta-globin gene, confers resistance to malaria but causes sickle cell disease when homozygous. This illustrates the delicate balance between survival and disease in our genetic makeup. Similarly, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations lead to an accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in lungs, resulting in cystic fibrosis. Herein lies the paradox of genetic mutations, they are both the architects of our unique identities and the engineers of our health vulnerabilities.
D1-178	Near a critical point, the time scale of thermally-induced fluctuations diverges in a manner determined by the dynamic universality class. Experiments have verified predicted 3D dynamic critical exponents in many systems, but similar experiments in 2D have been lacking for the case of conserved order parameter. Here we analyze time-dependent correlation functions of a quasi-2D lipid bilayer in water to show that its critical dynamics agree with a recently predicted universality class. In particular, the effective dynamic exponent $z_{eff}$ crosses over from $\sim 2$ to $\sim 3$ as the correlation length of fluctuations exceeds a hydrodynamic length set by the membrane and bulk viscosities.
D1-179	 In marine ecosystems, the case study of the Great Barrier Reef serves as a poignant reminder of the delicate balance within biological systems. This vast coral reef system, teeming with diverse life forms, is under threat due to climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Coral bleaching, mass mortality of coral polyps, and declining fish populations are alarming symptoms of this ecosystem's deterioration. The consequences ripple through the food chain, impacting seabirds, sea turtles, and even the livelihoods of coastal communities. Urgent action is needed to reduce carbon emissions, monitor the reef's health, and implement sustainable fishing practices to ensure the survival of this intricate and essential marine ecosystem.
D1-180	The quasispecies model of biological evolution for asexual organisms such as bacteria and viruses has attracted considerable attention of biological physicists. Many variants of the model have been proposed and subsequently solved using the methods of statistical physics. In this paper I will put forward important but largely overlooked relations between localization theory, random matrices, and the quasispecies model. These relations will help me to study the dynamics of this model. In particular, I will show that the distribution of times between evolutionary jumps in the genotype space follows a power law, in agreement with recent findings in the shell model - a simplified version of the quasispecies model.
D1-181	 In the intricate realm of molecular biology, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) stands as the blueprint of life. This double-helix structure, comprised of nucleotides, carries genetic information vital for an organism's development and function. During cell division, DNA replicates, ensuring each new cell inherits identical genetic material. Genes, segments of DNA, are the coded instructions that dictate the synthesis of proteins, essential for every biological process within a cell. DNA's robust structure and replication process have allowed it to maintain remarkable stability across generations, ensuring the continuity of life on Earth.
D1-182	Nested structure, which is non-random, controls cooperation dynamics and biodiversity in plant-animal mutualistic networks. This structural pattern has been explained in a static (non-growth) network models. However, evolutionary processes might also influence the formation of such a structural pattern. We thereby propose an evolving network model for plant-animal interactions and show that non-random patterns such as nested structure and heterogeneous connectivity are both qualitatively and quantitatively predicted through simple evolutionary processes. This finding implies that network models can be simplified by considering evolutionary processes, and also that another explanation exists for the emergence of non-random patterns and might provide more comprehensible insights into the formation of plant-animal mutualistic networks from the evolutionary perspective.
D1-183	 In the intricate realm of botany, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the lifeblood of green organisms. This biochemical marvel, carried out within chloroplasts, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The equation, while seemingly straightforward, belies the complexity of this process. Six carbon dioxide molecules, six water molecules, and an array of enzymes combine to create glucose and oxygen along with ATP and NADPH, providing the energy and reducing power essential for growth and reproduction. Photosynthesis, a dance of light, water, and carbon, underpins the survival of plant life, and, by extension, the oxygen-rich atmosphere that sustains all life on Earth.
D1-184	The interplay of geometrical and topological entanglement in semiflexible knotted polymer rings confined inside a spherical cavity is investigated using advanced numerical methods. By using stringent and robust algorithms for locating knots, we characterize how the knot length lk depends on the ring contour length, Lc and the radius of the confining sphere, Rc . In the no- and strong- confinement cases we observe weak knot localization and complete knot delocalization, respectively. We show that the complex interplay of lk, Lc and Rc that seamlessly bridges these two limits can be encompassed by a simple scaling argument based on deflection theory. The same argument is used to rationalize the multiscale character of the entanglement that emerges with increasing confinement.
D1-185	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics serves as a dynamic bridge between gene expression and environmental factors. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, alter the structure of chromatin without changing the DNA sequence itself. These changes can influence gene activity, making it a crucial link in understanding how our lifestyle, diet, and experiences can impact our health and development across generations. Epigenetics, therefore, provides a compelling perspective on the interplay between nature and nurture, offering a more comprehensive view of biological processes and their susceptibility to environmental influences.
D1-186	Abstracting an effective theory from a complicated process is central to the study of complexity. Even when the underlying mechanisms are understood, or at least measurable, the presence of dissipation and irreversibility in biological, computational and social systems makes the problem harder. Here we demonstrate the construction of effective theories in the presence of both irreversibility and noise, in a dynamical model with underlying feedback. We use the Krohn-Rhodes theorem to show how the composition of underlying mechanisms can lead to innovations in the emergent effective theory. We show how dissipation and irreversibility fundamentally limit the lifetimes of these emergent structures, even though, on short timescales, the group properties may be enriched compared to their noiseless counterparts.
D1-187	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, or firefly squid, exhibits an extraordinary display of light. These cephalopods produce light from specialized cells, called photophores, located throughout their bodies. By controlling the intensity and pattern of these lights, they camouflage themselves against predators and communicate with others in the deep sea. The exact mechanisms behind their light production remain a subject of scientific curiosity, as they emit blue light without the presence of oxygen and conventional enzymes. This peculiar ability, coupled with their rapid color changes and complex behavior, makes the bioluminescent squid a fascinating subject of study in the vast, mysterious depths of the ocean.
D1-188	Ankylography is a new 3D imaging technique, which, under certain circumstances, enables reconstruction of a 3D object from a single sample orientation. Here, we provide a matrix rank analysis to explain the principle of ankylography. We then present an ankylography experiment on a microscale phase object using an optical laser. Coherent diffraction patterns are acquired from the phase object using a planar CCD detector and are projected onto a spherical shell. The 3D structure of the object is directly reconstructed from the spherical diffraction pattern. This work may potentially open the door to a new method for 3D imaging of phase objects in the visible light region. Finally, the extension of ankylography to more complicated and larger objects is suggested.
D1-189	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid is a captivating organism. Thriving in the inky-black depths, they emit a mesmerizing glow to confuse predators or attract prey. This phenomenon is a result of a chemical reaction within their bodies, where luciferin and luciferase combine in the presence of oxygen, emitting a bright light. Interestingly, they can control the intensity and direction of their light, using a specialised organ called the photophore. Their intricate behavior and unique adaptations make squid a fascinating subject of study in the unexplored realms of the ocean.
D1-190	It is well known that during homology recognition and strand exchange the double stranded DNA (dsDNA) in DNA/RecA filaments is highly extended, but the functional role of the extension has been unclear. We present an analytical model that calculates the distribution of tension in the extended dsDNA during strand exchange. The model suggests that the binding of additional dsDNA base pairs to the DNA/RecA filament alters the tension in dsDNA that was already bound to the filament, resulting in a non-linear increase in the mechanical energy as a function of the number of bound base pairs. This collective mechanical response may promote homology stringency and underlie unexplained experimental results.
D1-191	 In the realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly alter an organism's traits and susceptibility to diseases. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found in non-coding regions, can subtly influence gene expression and protein function. Intriguingly, some SNPs, when present in large numbers, can create distinct population groups, shedding light on human evolution and migration patterns. Conversely, understanding the role of SNPs in disease development offers promising avenues for personalized medicine, enabling targeted therapies and early interventions. This dynamic interplay between genetics and health underscores the importance of SNP research in advancing our understanding of both evolutionary biology and human health.
D1-192	We summarize some aspects of electrostatic interactions in the context of viruses. A simplified but, within well defined limitations, reliable approach is used to derive expressions for electrostatic energies and the corresponding osmotic pressures in single-stranded RNA viruses and double-stranded DNA bacteriophages. The two types of viruses differ crucially in the spatial distribution of their genome charge which leads to essential differences in their free energies, depending on the capsid size and total charge in a quite different fashion. Differences in the free energies are trailed by the corresponding characteristics and variations in the osmotic pressure between the inside of the virus and the external bathing solution.
D1-193	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating offshoot. Epigenetics, not altering the DNA sequence itself, instead, modifies how cells read the genetic code. This modification, often influenced by environmental factors, can switch genes on or off, thereby affecting cellular functions and potentially leading to diseases like cancer or mental disorders. This field offers promising avenues for research, as it suggests that our lifestyle choices might have a profound impact on our genetic expression, offering a glimmer of hope for preventive medicine.
D1-194	We introduce a model of biological evolution where species evolve in response to biotic interactions and a fluctuating environmental stress. The species may either become extinct or mutate to acquire a new fitness value when the effective stress level is greater than their individual fitness. The model exhibits a phase transition to a completely extinct phase as the environmental stress or the mutation rate is varied. We discuss the generic conditions for which this transition is continuous. The model is exactly solvable and the critical behavior is characterized by an unusual dynamic exponent z=1/3. Apart from predicting large scale evolution, the model can be applied to understand the trends in the available fossil data.
D1-195	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, stands as a cornerstone. This biochemical miracle occurs in specialized cell structures called chloroplasts, which house the green pigment chlorophyll. Under the influence of sunlight, water absorbed from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air are transformed into glucose, a simple sugar that fuels plant growth. This process not only sustains plant life but also oxygenates our atmosphere, making it vital for the survival of all aerobic organisms. Photosynthesis, therefore, epitomizes the harmonious and interdependent nature of life on Earth.
D1-196	The emergence of biochemical activities in a protein seem to commence with the onset of atomic mean-square displacements along the protein lattice. The ensuing protein dynamical transition has been discussed extensively in the literature, and often with conflicting conclusions. Here we clarify the phenomenon by establishing a deep connection between the dynamical transition and the pseudogap state where high-temperature superconductivity comes to its end.   For this we first show how to endow proteins with an order parameter akin the quasiparticle wave function in superconductors. We then present universality arguments to claim that the protein dynamical transition takes place in tandem with a pseudogap transmutation. We confirm that available experimental data fully supports our proposal.
D1-197	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis emerges as a compelling phenomenon. This mutualistic relationship, occurring between diverse organisms, allows both parties to benefit, often in distinct yet interconnected ways. For instance, the clownfish and sea anemone partnership is a classic example. The clownfish, with its vibrant hues, finds protection among the anemone's stinging tentacles, while the anemone, in return, receives food scraps from the fish's meals. This harmonious coexistence, born out of necessity, reveals the profound interconnectedness of life forms, a testament to nature's ingenious solutions for survival.
D1-198	Correlations among spikes, both on the same neuron and across neurons, are ubiquitous in the brain. For example cross-correlograms can have large peaks, at least in the periphery, and smaller -- but still non-negligible -- ones in cortex, and auto-correlograms almost always exhibit non-trivial temporal structure at a range of timescales. Although this has been known for over forty years, it's still not clear what role these correlations play in the brain -- and, indeed, whether they play any role at all. The goal of this chapter is to shed light on this issue by reviewing some of the work on this subject.
D1-199	 In marine ecosystems, the delicate balance between predator and prey is exemplified by the interactions between the blue whale and krill. As the largest animal ever known to have lived, the blue whale's diet primarily consists of billions of tiny krill. Yet, this colossal mammal poses little threat to its minuscule prey due to its slow, leisurely feeding method known as skim-feeding. By opening its enormous mouth, the whale filters water and krill through baleen plates, carefully avoiding overconsumption and ensuring the survival of its food source. This symbiotic relationship, though seemingly improbable, underscores the intricate and interconnected nature of our planet's aquatic life.
D1-200	"""Cicada: a Heavy but Agile Flyer"" is a fluid dynamic video submitted to Gallery of Fluid Motion in APS-DFD 2011. Comparing to other insects, cicadas can generate much higher lift to overcome their large body weight. The hidden mechanism may help in designing a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) to carry large payloads. However, it is lack of literatures in discussing how cicadas use their wings to accomplish various flights. In this work, a high-speed photogrammetry system and 3D surface reconstruction technology are used to reveal cicada wing kinematics and deformation during a freely forward flight. The aerodynamic performance is studied using in-house immerse boundary method based Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) solver."
D1-201	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating study revolves around epigenetics, a layer of regulation that interacts with our DNA yet doesn't change the underlying code. Instead, it controls gene activity, responding to various environmental factors like diet, stress, and aging. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can influence the expression of genes, thus potentially affecting an organism's traits and health. This field offers promising avenues for understanding complex diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and even behaviors, as it hints at the possibility of heritable changes without altering the DNA sequence itself. The dynamic interplay between genetics and epigenetics uncovers a rich tapestry of life, highlighting the intricate balance between nature and nurture.
D1-202	We consider a generalized two-species population dynamic model and analytically solve it for the amensalism and commensalism ecological interactions. These two-species models can be simplified to a one-species model with a time dependent extrinsic growth factor. With a one-species model with an effective carrying capacity one is able to retrieve the steady state solutions of the previous one-species model. The equivalence obtained between the effective carrying capacity and the extrinsic growth factor is complete only for a particular case, the Gompertz model. Here we unveil important aspects of sigmoid growth curves, which are relevant to growth processes and population dynamics.
D1-203	 In marine biology, the symbiotic relationship between sea anemones and clownfish is a captivating example of mutualism. Clownfish find refuge within the anemone's tentacles, receiving protection from predators. On the other hand, the anemone benefits from the presence of the clownfish, as they drive away predatory fish that might harm the anemone. This interdependency ensures the survival of both species in their shared habitat, and it exemplifies how complex ecosystems can function harmoniously. This symbiosis serves as a powerful illustration of the intricate connections within the marine world, emphasizing the importance of each organism within their intricate web of life.
D1-204	The precise role of the microenvironment on tumor growth is poorly understood. Whereas the tumor is in constant competition with the surrounding tissue, little is known about the mechanics of this interaction. Using a novel experimental procedure, we study quantitatively the effect of an applied mechanical stress on the long-term growth of a spheroid cell aggregate. We observe that a stress of 10 kPa is sufficient to drastically reduce growth by inhibition of cell proliferation mainly in the core of the spheroid. We compare the results to a simple numerical model developed to describe the role of mechanics in cancer progression.
D1-205	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This remarkable transformation not only fuels the organic world but also enriches the atmosphere with life-sustaining oxygen. Photosynthesis is a testament to nature's resilience and ingenuity, a continuous cycle that sustains the delicate balance of our ecosystems. It's a silent, yet vital symphony that echoes across the globe, powering the web of life.
D1-206	DNA based nanostructures built on a long single stranded DNA scaffold, known as DNA origamis, offer the possibility to organize various molecules at the nanometer scale in one pot experiments.   The folding of the scaffold is guaranteed by the presence of short, single stranded DNA sequences (staples), that hold together separate regions of the scaffold. In this paper, we modelize the annealing-melting properties of these DNA constructions. The model captures important features such as the hysteresis between melting and annealing, as well as the dependence upon the topology of the scaffold. We show that cooperativity between staples is critical to quantitatively explain the folding process of DNA origamis.
D1-207	 In the intricate realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, a dance of life between plants and sunlight. This natural phenomenon occurs in the chloroplasts, green organelles within plant cells. Here, carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen, fueling plant growth and releasing a gas essential for animal respiration. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthetic organisms and the atmosphere is crucial for the survival of life on Earth, a testament to the harmonious balance that underpins our planet's biosphere.
D1-208	"Information is a key concept in evolutionary biology. Information is stored in biological organism's genomes, and used to generate the organism as well as to maintain and control it. Information is also ""that which evolves"". When a population adapts to a local environment, information about this environment is fixed in a representative genome. However, when an environment changes, information can be lost. At the same time, information is processed by animal brains to survive in complex environments, and the capacity for information processing also evolves. Here I review applications of information theory to the evolution of proteins as well as to the evolution of information processing in simulated agents that adapt to perform a complex task."
D1-209	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis, a harmonious relationship between different species, plays a pivotal role. For instance, consider the mutualistic partnership between termites and protozoa. The protozoa, single-celled organisms, break down wood fibers, making them digestible for termites. In return, termites provide the protozoa with a protective environment and food. This symbiotic relationship allows termites to thrive in their wood-dwelling habitats, contributing significantly to nutrient cycling in various ecosystems. Such cooperative relationships, both within and between species, underscore the interconnectedness of life on Earth.
D1-210	"Finite stochastic Markov models play a major role for modelling biochemical pathways. Such models are a coarse-grained description of the underlying microscopic dynamics and can be considered mesoscopic. The level of coarse-graining is to a certain extend arbitrary since it depends on the resolution of accomodating measurements. Here, we present a way to simplify such stochastic descriptions, which preserves both the meso-micro and the meso-macro connection. The former is achieved by demanding locality, the latter by considering cycles on the network of states. Using single- and multicycle examples we demonstrate how our new method preserves fluctuations of observables much better than na\""ive approaches."
D1-211	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone, a stationary cnidarian, plays a crucial role. With their tentacles extended, they lure and capture small fish and plankton, creating a dynamic food web. These tentacles contain cnidocytes, specialized cells that can sting prey for capture. Furthermore, sea anemones provide a symbiotic home for clownfish, whom they protect with their sting. This mutualistic relationship strengthens the anemone's defenses against predators, while the clownfish expel harmful algae and feed on parasites that may affect the anemone. Thus, the sea anemone's seemingly passive existence belies its significance in maintaining balance within the ocean's intricate web of life.
D1-212	This article shows how to fit reticulate finite and infinite sites sequence spectra to aligned data from five modern human genomes (San, Yoruba, French, Han and Papuan) plus two archaic humans (Denisovan and Neanderthal), to better infer demographic parameters. These include interbreeding between distinct lineages. Major improvements in the fit of the sequence spectrum are made with successively more complicated models. Findings include some evidence of a male biased gene flow from the Denisova lineage to Papuan ancestors and possibly even more archaic gene flow. It is unclear if there is evidence for more than one Neanderthal interbreeding, as the evidence suggesting this largely disappears when a finite sites model is fitted.
D1-213	" In the intricate realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands as a revolutionary tool. This bacterial defense mechanism, repurposed for gene editing, allows precise modifications to DNA sequences. By harnessing this technology, scientists can correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, and even eradicate disease-causing genes. The potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 span from curing genetic disorders to enhancing crops for global food security. However, ethical considerations loom large, as the prospect of designing babies with ""designer"" genes raises profound questions about humanity's role in shaping the future of life. As we navigate this exciting frontier, striking a balance between scientific progress and moral responsibility becomes paramount."
D1-214	We show how strain stiffening affects the elastic response to internal forces, caused either by material defects and inhomogeneities or by active forces that molecular motors generate in living cells. For a spherical force dipole in a material with a strongly nonlinear strain energy density, strains change sign with distance, indicating that even around a contractile inclusion or molecular motor there is radial compression. it is only at long distance that one recovers the linear response in which the medium is radially stretched. Scaling laws with irrational exponents relate the far-field renormalized strain to the near-field strain applied by the inclusion or active force.
D1-215	 In the realm of microbiology, the bacterium known as Streptococcus pneumoniae plays a pivotal role. This pathogen, often found in the respiratory tract, can lead to potentially fatal infections like pneumonia and meningitis. Its capsule, composed of polysaccharides, offers protection, making it resistant to host defenses and antibiotics. Vaccination is a critical preventative measure, containing multiple capsular types to offer broad immunity. However, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains poses a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing research for effective treatment strategies.
D1-216	Neutral particles ejected from biological material under ultra short laser ablation have been investigated by laser post-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. It could be shown, that beside ionized species, a substantial amount of neutral particles is ejected. A temporal study of the ablation plume is carried out by recording neutral particle time-of- flight mass spectra as a function of delay time between the ablation and post-ionization pulse. Close the ablation threshold, the mechanism of ejection is found to be of predominantely mechanical nature, driven by the relaxation of the laser-induced pressure. In this regime of stress confinement, the ejection results in very broad velocity distributions and extremely low velocities.
D1-217	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, known as the dragonfish, is a fascinating creature. With a translucent body, it's almost invisible during the day. Yet, at night, it shines brightly, producing light through a chemical reaction within its body. This light serves multiple purposes, such as attracting prey, deterring predators, and communicating with others of its kind. Its complex eyes, capable of seeing in multiple directions simultaneously, allow it to navigate in the deep, dark ocean. The dragonfish's adaptation to its environment showcases the remarkable diversity and resilience found in marine life.
D1-218	We study the variation of the dielectric response of a dielectric liquid (e.g. water) when a salt is added to the solution. Employing field-theoretical methods we expand the Gibbs free-energy to first order in a loop expansion and calculate self-consistently the dielectric constant. We predict analytically the dielectric decrement which depends on the ionic strength in a complex way. Furthermore, a qualitative description of the hydration shell is found and is characterized by a single length scale. Our prediction fits rather well a large range of concentrations for different salts using only one fit parameter related to the size of ions and dipoles.
D1-219	 In the realm of botany, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal life-sustaining process. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process takes place in chloroplasts, within cell organelles called chloroplast thylakoids and stroma. During the light-dependent reactions, solar energy is converted into chemical energy, generating ATP and NADPH. Simultaneously, the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, utilize these molecules to convert carbon dioxide into glucose, emitting oxygen as a byproduct. This intricate dance of energy and chemistry allows life on Earth to flourish, keeping our planet green and vibrant.
D1-220	We study the synchronisation and phase-lag of fluctuations in the number of infected individuals in a network of cities between which individuals commute. The frequency and amplitude of these oscillations is known to be very well captured by the van Kampen system-size expansion, and we use this approximation to compute the complex coherence function that describes their correlation. We find that, if the infection rate differs from city to city and the coupling between them is not too strong, these oscillations are synchronised with a well defined phase lag between cities. The analytic description of the effect is shown to be in good agreement with the results of stochastic simulations for realistic population sizes.
D1-221	 In the realm of genetics, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds. This process, a fundamental aspect of life, ensures the faithful copying of genetic information from one generation to the next. During replication, the double helix unwinds, allowing the creation of new complementary strands. The enzyme helicase facilitates this unwinding, while DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to build the new strands. To maintain the integrity of the DNA, the enzyme proofreading polymerase corrects errors as they occur. This seemingly simple process, repeated countless times, underpins the very foundation of heredity and evolution.
D1-222	In a previous paper (S. Ghosal and Z. Chen Bull. Math. Biol. 2010, vol. 72, pg. 2047) it was shown that the evolution of the solute concentration in capillary electrophoresis is described by a nonlinear wave equation that reduced to Burger's equation if the nonlinearity was weak. It was assumed that only strong electrolytes (fully dissociated) were present. In the present paper it is shown that the same governing equation also describes the situation where the electrolytic buffer consists of a single weak acid (or base). A simple approximate formula is derived for the dimensionless peak variance which is shown to agree well with published experimental data.
D1-223	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the process of photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone. Green plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This biochemical marvel occurs within chloroplasts, where pigments like chlorophyll capture light, initiating a series of reactions. The ATP synthesized fuels the endergonic steps, while the NADPH reduces the oxidized intermediates. The net outcome is both the creation of organic matter and the release of oxygen, a vital resource for aerobic organisms. Photosynthesis, therefore, is not just a plant's means of survival, but a fundamental link in Earth's carbon and oxygen cycles, sustaining the very atmosphere that nurtures life.
D1-224	Genome-wide protein-protein interaction (PPI) data are readily available thanks to recent breakthroughs in biotechnology. However, PPI networks of extant organisms are only snapshots of the network evolution. How to infer the whole evolution history becomes a challenging problem in computational biology. In this paper, we present a likelihood-based approach to inferring network evolution history from the topology of PPI networks and the duplication relationship among the paralogs. Simulations show that our approach outperforms the existing ones in terms of the accuracy of reconstruction. Moreover, the growth parameters of several real PPI networks estimated by our method are more consistent with the ones predicted in literature.
D1-225	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis serves as a beacon of harmony between nature's realms. This biochemical process, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, involves the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This symphony of reactions, driven by sunlight and enzymes, not only sustains life on Earth but also regenerates the very atmosphere that nurtures it. Photosynthesis, thus, stands as an embodiment of nature's resilience and adaptability, offering a testament to the intricate balance that governs our world.
D1-226	Multistep denaturation in a short circular DNA molecule is analyzed by a mesoscopic Hamiltonian model which accounts for the helicoidal geometry. Computation of melting profiles by the path integral method suggests that stacking anharmonicity stabilizes the double helix against thermal disruption of the hydrogen bonds. Twisting is essential in the model to capture the importance of nonlinear effects on the thermodynamical properties. In a ladder model with zero twist, anharmonic stacking scarcely affects the thermodynamics. Moderately untwisted helices, with respect to the equilibrium conformation, show an energetic advantage against the overtwisted ones. Accordingly moderately untwisted helices better sustain local fluctuational openings and make more unlikely the thermally driven complete strand separation.

This transformation is primarily achieved by symbiotic bacteria, such as Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, residing in root nodules of leguminous plants. During this process, these bacteria convert nitrogen gas into ammonia, a form of nitrogen that plants can absorb. This symbiotic relationship is crucial for soil fertility and plant nutrition, as nitrogen is a fundamental element in the synthesis of proteins, DNA, and chlorophyll. Moreover, nitrogen fixation plays a significant role in maintaining global nitrogen cycles, impacting ecosystems and agriculture worldwide.

In our model, a single nucleotide or domain is represented by a single interaction site. Complementary sites can reversibly hybridize and dehybridize during a simulation. This bond dynamics induces a dynamics of the angular and dihedral bonds, that model the collective effects of chemical structure on the hybridization dynamics. We use the DNA model to perform simulations of the self-assembly kinetics of DNA tetrahedra, an icosahedron, as well as strand displacement operations used in DNA computation.

This underwater forest thrives in nutrient-rich cold waters, growing up to 2 feet per day. Giant kelp's intricate network of floating brown algae provides a sanctuary for various marine life, including sea otters, fish, and invertebrates. The kelp forest's structure also plays a significant role in maintaining water quality, absorbing carbon dioxide, and protecting coastlines from erosion. Its demise, due to factors such as climate change, overfishing, and pollution, can have cascading effects on the entire marine ecosystem. The preservation of these underwater forests is essential for the health and balance of marine biodiversity.
D1-232	In a variety of biological processes, eukaryotic cells use cilia to transport flow. Although cilia have a remarkably conserved internal molecular structure, experimental observations report very diverse kinematics. To address this diversity, we determine numerically the kinematics and energetics of the most efficient cilium. Specifically, we compute the time-periodic deformation of a wall-bound elastic filament leading to transport of a surrounding fluid at minimum energetic cost, where the cost is taken to be the positive work done by all internal molecular motors. The optimal kinematics are found to strongly depend on the cilium bending rigidity through a single dimensionless number, the Sperm number, and closely resemble the two-stroke ciliary beating pattern observed experimentally.

These changes can be influenced by various factors like age, diet, stress, and toxins, hence offering an intriguing perspective on how lifestyle choices and external conditions might impact health and disease. For instance, research suggests that maternal nutrition during pregnancy can influence epigenetic patterns in offspring, potentially shaping their susceptibility to certain diseases later in life. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores the complexity of biological systems and opens up exciting avenues for preventive medicine and personalized healthcare.

Under these refinements the close-packed motif is shown to be stable. For the case of the 7/2 motif a similar stability exists. The electronic circular dichroism of the close-packed model has a significant negative bias and a large signal. An interesting feature of the close-packed structure is the existence of a central channel. Simulations show that, if hydrogen atoms are placed in the cavity, a chain of molecular hydrogens is formed suggesting a possible biological function for molecular hydrogen.

Transcription factors, the maestros, bind to specific DNA sequences, known as enhancers or promoters, initiating or suppressing gene transcription. This control mechanism is instrumental in determining the type and amount of proteins produced, thereby shaping an organism's characteristics and functions. Post-transcriptional regulation further fine-tunes protein abundance through mechanisms such as splicing, translation, and degradation. This intricate dance of gene expression is essential for life, as it enables cells to respond to their environment, maintain homeostasis, and carry out their designated roles.
D1-236	"It is well known since the pioneering work of Goldbeter and Koshland [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 78, pp. 6840-6844 (1981)] that cellular phosphorylation- dephosphorylation cycle (PdPC), catalyzed by kinase and phosphatase under saturated condition with zeroth order enzyme kinetics, exhibits ultrasensitivity, sharp transition. We analyse the dynamics aspects of the zeroth order PdPC kinetics and show a critical slowdown akin to the phase transition in condensed matter physics. We demonstrate that an extremely simple, though somewhat mathematically ""singular"" model is a faithful representation of the ultrasentivity phenomenon. The simplified mathematical model will be valuable, as a component, in developing complex cellular signaling network theory as well as having a pedagogic value."
D1-237	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly impact an organism's traits. These minute differences in DNA sequence, often occurring at every 1,000 bases, are responsible for a myriad of variations among individuals. For instance, a particular SNP in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, a crucial component of the immune system, plays a decisive role in determining susceptibility to certain diseases. Similarly, a specific SNP in the APOE gene is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. The study of these genetic variants not only broadens our understanding of inherited traits and diseases but also promises potential for targeted therapeutic strategies in personalized medicine.

Here we propose a new experimental approach based on molecular photoswitches to achieve additional control on the chemical reaction and to allow short-time resolution of the spin dynamics. Our proposal enables experiments to test some of the standard assumptions of the radical pair model and improves the sensitivity of chemical magnetometers by two orders of magnitude.
D1-239	 In the captivating world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a compelling offshoot. While DNA dictates our genetic makeup, epigenetics orchestrates a symphony of changes, altering the behavior of genes without modifying the DNA sequence itself. This intricate dance involves chemical tags added to DNA and histone proteins, influencing gene activity and expression. Epigenetic changes can be triggered by various factors, such as aging, environmental influences, and behavior, offering a fascinating perspective on how life can adapt and respond to its surroundings. This dynamic interplay between genetics and epigenetics shapes the complex tapestry of life, revealing a deeper understanding of heredity and the intricate interplay between nature and nurture.
D1-240	We report numerical simulations of membrane tubulation driven by large colloidal particles. Using Monte Carlo simulations we study how the process depends on particle size, concentration and binding strength, and present accurate free energy calculations to sort out how tube formation compares with the competing budding process. We find that tube formation is a result of the collective behavior of the particles adhering on the surface, and it occurs for binding strengths that are smaller than those required for budding. We also find that long linear aggregates of particles forming on the membrane surface act as nucleation seeds for tubulation by lowering the free energy barrier associated to the process.
D1-241	 In botany, the process of photosynthesis is a fundamental life-sustaining mechanism for plants. This biochemical reaction converts carbon dioxide and water, using light energy, into glucose and oxygen. The overall equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2. This process takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically in structures called thylakoids and grana. Here, light is absorbed by chlorophyll, driving a series of electron transport reactions that eventually produce ATP and NADPH. Simultaneously, in the stroma, these energy-rich molecules fuel the Calvin cycle, which synthesizes glucose from carbon dioxide. The oxygen produced is a byproduct and crucial for aerobic life on Earth.
D1-242	We analyse a large data set of genetic markers obtained from populations of Cymodocea nodosa, a marine plant occurring from the East Mediterranean to the Iberian-African coasts in the Atlantic Ocean. We fully develop and test a recently introduced methodology to infer the directionality of gene flow based on the concept of geographical segregation. Using the Jensen-Shannon divergence, we are able to extract a directed network of gene flow describing the evolutionary patterns of Cymodocea nodosa. In particular we recover the genetic segregation that the marine plant underwent during its evolution. The results are confirmed by natural evidence and are consistent with an independent cross analysis.

These microscopic organisms, when disturbed, emit a soft, blue-green glow, creating mesmerizing displays in the ocean depths, a spectacle often referred to as ""sea sparkle."" This phenomenon occurs due to a chemical reaction within the dinoflagellates, where the enzyme luciferase interacts with a molecule called luciferin, emitting light. This natural illumination not only offers a mesmerizing sight but also serves as a defense mechanism against predators, as the sudden light can startle or confuse potential threats. The study of these glowing organisms continues to shed light on the intricacies of life in the deep sea, leaving us in awe of nature's wonder."

We have obtained information that the ESR signal from the spores was observed and preliminarily assignable to semiquinone radical with a g-value of around 2.004 and a line width of approximately 5G. The decay of the signal is possibly linked to the inactivation of the fungal spore. The real-time in situ ESR has proven to be a useful method to elucidate plasma-induced surface reactions on biological specimens.
D1-245	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single base pair mutation can lead to profound effects. The Human Genome Project, a monumental undertaking, deciphered the entirety of human DNA, opening doors to personalized medicine. This revolutionizing approach, rooted in understanding an individual's unique genetic makeup, allows for tailored treatments, enhancing efficacy while minimizing side effects.

As we delve deeper into the genetic blueprint of humanity, questions arise about privacy, discrimination, and the manipulation of genes for non-medical purposes. Balancing the exciting potential of genetic medicine with ethical considerations is crucial as we navigate this new frontier in biology.
D1-246	Using an experimental optimization approach, this study investigated whether two human movements, pointing tasks and squat-jumps, could be modelled with a reduced set of kinematic parameters. Three sigmoid models were proposed to model the evolution of joint angles. The models parameters were optimized to fit the 2D position of the joints obtained from 304 pointing tasks and 120 squat-jumps. The models were accurate for both movements. This study provides a new framework to model planar movements with a small number of meaningful kinematic parameters, allowing a continuous description of both kinematics and kinetics.

As we navigate this new frontier, it's crucial to establish clear guidelines and regulations to ensure responsible use of this powerful technology for the betterment of humanity.
D1-248	We present force-clamp data on the collapse of ubiquitin polyproteins in response to a quench in the force. These nonequilibrium trajectories are analyzed using a general method based on a diffusive assumption of the end-to-end length to reconstruct a downhill free energy profile at 5pN and an energy plateau at 10pN with a slow diffusion coefficient on the order of~100nm^2/s. The shape of the free energy and its linear scaling with the protein length give validity to a physical model for the collapse. However, the length independent diffusion coefficient suggests that internal rather than viscous friction dominates and thermal noise is needed to capture the variability in the measured times to collapse.
D1-249	 In Marine Biology, the blenny fish, a tiny yet intriguing species, exhibits remarkable adaptability. Often found in rocky intertidal zones, they possess a unique ability to change their color and pattern, aiding camouflage against predators and competitors. Blennies have reinforced scales and a flattened body shape, enabling them to cling tenaciously to their substrate, even during extreme tidal shifts. Their diet primarily consists of algae, small invertebrates, and plankton, demonstrating their omnivorous nature. Blennies are also known for their territorial behavior, with male blennies fiercely defending their territory from rivals. This resilient and versatile fish serves as an excellent model for studying evolutionary adaptations in the marine environment.
D1-250	The ability of migratory birds to orient relative to the Earth's magnetic field is believed to involve a coherent superposition of two spin states of a radical electron pair. However, the mechanism by which this coherence can be maintained in the face of strong interactions with the cellular environment has remained unclear. This Letter addresses the problem of decoherence between two electron spins due to hyperfine interaction with a bath of spin 1/2 nuclei. Dynamics of the radical pair density matrix are derived and shown to yield a simple mechanism for sensing magnetic field orientation. Rates of dephasing and decoherence are calculated ab initio and found to yield millisecond coherence times, consistent with behavioral experiments.

These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring at non-coding regions, can influence gene expression levels, regulatory functions, or even be associated with susceptibility to diseases. For instance, a specific SNP in the APOE gene is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. In another context, an SNP in the BRCA1 gene can heighten the likelihood of breast and ovarian cancer. Moreover, these SNPs, when analyzed collectively in large populations, can provide valuable insights into genetic predispositions, offering promising avenues for personalized medicine and potential prevention strategies.
D1-252	It is believed that the quantum coherence itself cannot explain the very high excitation energy transfer (EET) efficiency in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. In this paper, we show that this is not the case if the inter-site couplings take complex values. By phenomenologically introducing phases into the inter-site couplings, we obtain the EET efficiency as high as 0.8972 in contrast to 0.6781 with real inter-site couplings. Dependence of the excitation energy transfer efficiency on the initial states is elaborated. Effects of fluctuations in the site energies and inter-site couplings are also examined.
D1-253	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon is a fascinating spectacle. Certain deep-sea organisms, such as jellyfish, squid, and certain types of fish, possess the ability to produce and emit light. This natural illumination is a result of a chemical reaction within the organism, which creates energy in the form of light. This light serves multiple purposes, including attracting prey, deterring predators, or communicating with fellow species. The precise mechanism behind bioluminescence involves a protein called luciferin, a catalyst called luciferase, and oxygen. When these components react, they produce light energy, making deep-sea life not just mysterious but also a marvel of biological chemistry.
D1-254	While modern structural biology has provided us with a rich and diverse picture of membrane proteins, the biological function of membrane proteins is often influenced by the mechanical properties of the surrounding lipid bilayer. Here we explore the relation between the shape of membrane proteins and the cooperative function of membrane proteins induced by membrane-mediated elastic interactions. For the experimental model system of mechanosensitive ion channels we find that the sign and strength of elastic interactions depend on the protein shape, yielding distinct cooperative gating curves for distinct protein orientations. Our approach predicts how directional elastic interactions affect the molecular structure, organization, and biological function of proteins in crowded membranes.
D1-255	 In the fascinating realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can hold vast implications. These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring at specific locations, serve as genetic markers, often associated with hereditary traits or susceptibility to certain diseases. For instance, a specific SNP might increase the likelihood of developing a particular illness, or it could influence an organism's physical characteristics, such as eye color or hair texture. The study of SNPs is instrumental in understanding genetic diversity, tracing ancestry, and devising targeted treatments for genetic disorders. This microscopic piece of DNA, barely visible to the naked eye, thus carries a macroscopic impact on our understanding of biology and human health.
D1-256	We use a recently developed coarse-grained model to simulate the overstretching of duplex DNA. Overstretching at 23C occurs at 74 pN in the model, about 6-7 pN higher than the experimental value at equivalent salt conditions. Furthermore, the model reproduces the temperature dependence of the overstretching force well. The mechanism of overstretching is always force-induced melting by unpeeling from the free ends. That we never see S-DNA (overstretched duplex DNA), even though there is clear experimental evidence for this mode of overstretching under certain conditions, suggests that S-DNA is not simply an unstacked but hydrogen-bonded duplex, but instead probably has a more exotic structure.
D1-257	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can have profound impacts. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often found within genes, can subtly alter protein structure and function, leading to differences in traits and even susceptibility to diseases. However, it's essential to remember that while SNPs are individual markers, their effects are often complex and influenced by multiple factors, including other genetic variations and environmental conditions. Thus, understanding the role of SNPs in biology demands a comprehensive approach that considers the entire genetic landscape and the intricate dance between genes and the environment.

The precise relation of diffusion metrics to microstructure remains a major challenge: In complex samples, it is often unclear which structural features are most relevant and can be quantified. Here we classify the structural complexity in terms of the long time tail exponent in the molecular velocity autocorrelation function. The specific values of the dynamical exponent let us identify the relevant tissue microanatomy affecting water diffusion measured with MRI in muscles and in brain, and the microstructural changes in ischemic stroke. Our framework presents a systematic way to identify the most relevant part of structural complexity using transport measured with a variety of techniques.

But debate continues over whether macroevolutionary phenomena are driven primary by the fitness structure of genotype space or by ecological interaction. In this paper we propose a simple, abstract model capturing some key features of fitness-landscape and ecological models of evolution. Our model describes evolutionary dynamics in a high-dimensional, structured genotype space with a significant role for interspecific interaction. We find some promising qualitative similarity with the empirical facts about macroevolution, including broadly distributed extinction sizes and realistic exploration of the genotype space. The abstraction of our model permits numerous interpretations and applications beyond macroevolution, including molecular evolution and technological innovation.

It facilitates the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ensuring the replication and continuity of genetic information within cells. This enzyme reads the existing DNA strand, or template, and adds complementary nucleotides in a precise order, thus creating a new strand. DNA polymerase is indispensable for cell growth and division, and its malfunction can lead to genetic mutations and diseases like cancer. This enzyme's intricate dance of replication underscores the intricacy and precision of life at its most fundamental level.
D1-262	Global dynamical behaviors of the competitive Lotka-Volterra system even in 3-dimension are not fully understood. The Lyapunov function can provide us such knowledge once it is constructed. In this paper, we construct explicitly the Lyapunov function in three examples of the competitive Lotka-Volterra system for the whole state space: (1) the general 2-dimensional case. (2) a 3-dimensional model. (3) the model of May-Leonard. The dynamics of these examples include bistable case and cyclical behavior. The first two examples are the generalized gradient system defined in the Appendixes, while the model of May-Leonard is not. Our method is helpful to understand the limit cycle problems in general 3-dimensional case.

Photosynthesis not only fuels the growth of plants but also replenishes our atmosphere, providing us with vital oxygen. This intricate dance between sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide serves as a poignant reminder of the delicate balance that governs our world, underscoring the interconnectedness of all living things.
D1-264	We review the mathematical formalism underlying the modelling of stochasticity in biological systems. Beginning with a description of the system in terms of its basic constituents, we derive the mesoscopic equations governing the dynamics which generalise the more familiar macroscopic equations. We apply this formalism to the analysis of two specific noise-induced phenomena observed in biologically-inspired models. In the first example, we show how the stochastic amplification of a Turing instability gives rise to spatial and temporal patterns which may be understood within the linear noise approximation. The second example concerns the spontaneous emergence of cell polarity, where we make analytic progress by exploiting a separation of time-scales.

As DNA sequencing advances, it promises to further expand our knowledge, enabling us to tackle global challenges such as infectious diseases, genetic disorders, and even personalized medicine.
D1-266	"One of the most fundamental concepts of evolutionary dynamics is the ""fixation"" probability, i.e. the probability that a mutant spreads through the whole population. Most natural communities are geographically structured into habitats exchanging individuals among each other and can be modeled by an evolutionary graph (EG), where directed links weight the probability for the offspring of one individual to replace another individual in the community. Very few exact analytical results are known for EGs. We show here how by using the techniques of the fixed point of Probability Generating Function, we can uncover a large class of of graphs, which we term bithermal, for which the exact fixation probability can be simply computed."

It underscores the importance of holistic approaches to health, emphasizing the significance of lifestyle choices in shaping our genetic destiny.
D1-268	We present a minimal continuum model of strongly adhering cells as active contractile isotropic media and use the model to study the effect of the geometry of the adhesion patch in controlling the spatial distribution of traction and cellular stresses. Activity is introduced as a contractile, hence negative, spatially homogeneous contribution to the pressure. The model shows that patterning of adhesion regions can be used to control traction stress distribution and yields several results consistent with experimental observations. Specifically, the cell spread area is found to increase with substrate stiffness and an analytic expression for the dependence is obtained for circular cells. The correlation between the magnitude of traction stresses and cell boundary curvature is also demonstrated and analyzed.

This symphony of reactions not only fuels the plant but also enriches our atmosphere with life-sustaining oxygen. Photosynthesis's intricate dance is a reminder of the profound interconnectedness between life and its environment, a dance that has sustained our planet for millennia.
D1-270	Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we investigate the dynamics of polymer translocation into a circular nanocontainer through a nanopore under a driving force $F$. We observe that the translocation probability initially increases and then saturates with increasing $F$, independent of $\phi$, which is the average density of the whole chain in the nanocontainer. The translocation time distribution undergoes a transition from a Gaussian distribution to an asymmetric distribution with increasing $\phi$. Moreover, we find a nonuniversal scaling exponent of the translocation time as chain length, depending on $\phi$ and $F$. These results are interpreted by the conformation of the translocated chain in the nanocontainer and the time of an individual segment passing through the pore during translocation.

We observe good agreement between circuit measurements and numerical prediction, with the circuit allowing for robust logic operations in an optimal window of noise. Namely, the input-output characteristics of a logic gate is reproduced faithfully under moderate noise, which is a manifestation of the phenomenon known as Logical Stochastic Resonance. The two dynamical variables in the system yield complementary logic behaviour simultaneously. The system is easily morphed from AND/NAND to OR/NOR logic.
D1-273	 In the fascinating realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can have profound impacts. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring at every 1000 bases, can influence traits, susceptibility to diseases, and even responses to drugs. For instance, a specific SNP in the CYP2D6 gene may determine an individual's metabolism of certain medications, leading to varying effectiveness or side effects. Similarly, SNPs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. The study of SNPs thus offers invaluable insights into human genetics and healthcare, paving the way for personalized medicine and a more tailored approach to disease prevention and treatment.
D1-274	Various biological sensory systems exhibit a response to a relative change of the stimulus, often referred to as fold-change detection. In the last few years fold-change detecting mechanisms, based on transcriptional networks, have been proposed. Here we present fold-change detecting mechanism, based on protein-protein interactions, consisting of two interacting proteins. This mechanism, in contrast to previously proposed mechanisms, does not consume chemical energy and is not subject to transcriptional and translational noise. We show by analytical and numerical calculations, that the mechanism can have a fast, precise and efficient response for parameters that are relevant to eukaryotic cells.
D1-275	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics sheds light on modifications that influence gene expression, yet do not alter the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, such as methylation and histone modification, are crucial in regulating the activity of genes, hence impacting various cellular processes. Notably, epigenetic changes can occur due to environmental factors, including diet, stress, and toxins, and can be heritable. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores the complexity of biological systems and offers potential avenues for understanding and combating diseases that are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.
D1-276	Inference of gene regulatory network from expression data is a challenging task. Many methods have been developed to this purpose but a comprehensive evaluation that covers unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised methods, and provides guidelines for their practical application, is lacking.   We performed an extensive evaluation of inference methods on simulated expression data. The results reveal very low prediction accuracies for unsupervised techniques with the notable exception of the z-score method on knock-out data. In all other cases the supervised approach achieved the highest accuracies and even in a semi-supervised setting with small numbers of only positive samples, outperformed the unsupervised techniques.
D1-277	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can have significant implications. These minute variations in DNA sequence can subtly alter protein structure, influencing traits and susceptibility to diseases. For instance, a specific SNP in the APOE gene is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, SNPs can heighten the probability of breast and ovarian cancers. These genetic markers, once understood, can aid in early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies, revolutionizing the approach to healthcare. However, it's crucial to remember that genetics is complex and influenced by multiple factors, including environment and lifestyle. Thus, while SNPs offer valuable insights, they should be considered in conjunction with a holistic view of an individual's health.
D1-278	"Wang-Landau sampling has been applied to investigate the thermodynamics and structural properties of a lattice hydrophobic-polar heteropolymer (the HP protein model) interacting with an attractive substrate. For simplicity, we consider a short HP sequence consisting of only 36 monomers interacting with a substrate which attracts all monomers in the sequence. The conformational ""phase transitions"" have been identified by a canonical analysis of the specific heat and suitable structural observables. Three major ""transitions"", namely, adsorption, hydrophobic core formation and ""flattening"" of adsorbed structures, are observed. Depending on the surface attractive strength relative to the intra-protein attraction among the H monomers, these processes take place in different sequences upon cooling."

As we navigate this exciting frontier, ethical considerations loom large, demanding thoughtful dialogue and careful stewardship of this powerful technology.
D1-280	We characterize cell motion in experiments and show that the transition to collective motion in colonies of gliding bacterial cells confined to a monolayer appears through the organization of cells into larger moving clusters. Collective motion by non-equilibrium cluster formation is detected for a critical cell packing fraction around 17%. This transition is characterized by a scale-free power-law cluster size distribution, with an exponent $0.88\pm0.07$, and the appearance of giant number fluctuations. Our findings are in quantitative agreement with simulations of self-propelled rods. This suggests that the interplay of self-propulsion of bacteria and the rod-shape of bacteria is sufficient to induce collective motion.

This social, multicellular bacterium exhibits intricate behavior, forming swarming streams to hunt prey, a rare trait among bacteria. When food sources dwindle, M. xanthus undergoes a transformation, converting from a motile, single-celled organism to a spore, ensuring its survival in adverse conditions. This microscopic marvel, with its complex social dynamics and adaptive capabilities, sheds light on the intricacies of bacterial life and their potential for biotechnological applications.
D1-282	Intracellular transport based on molecular motors and its regulation are crucial to the functioning of cells. Filamentary tracks of the cells are abundantly decorated with non-motile microtubule-associated proteins, such as tau. Motivated by experiments on kinesin-tau interactions [Dixit et al. Science 319, 1086 (2008)] we developed a stochastic model of interacting single-headed motor proteins KIF1A that also takes into account the interactions between motor proteins and tau molecules. Our model reproduce experimental observations and predicts significant effects of tau on bound time and run length which suggest an important role of tau in regulation of kinesin-based transport.
D1-283	 In the realm of evolution, the process of natural selection plays a pivotal role. It favors traits that enhance survival and reproduction, shaping diverse species over countless generations. Yet, evolution is not a linear progression towards complexity. it's a dynamic dance of adaptations. Mutations, the genetic variations within populations, serve as the raw material for this dance. Some mutations are advantageous, others neutral, and a few are detrimental. It's the balance of these that leads to the intricate tapestry of life we observe today, a testament to time, chance, and the relentless pursuit of survival.
D1-284	Morphologic diversity is observed across all families of viruses. Yet these supra-molecular assemblies are produced most of the time in a spontaneous way through complex molecular self-assembly scenarios. The modeling of these phenomena remains a challenging problem within the emerging field of Physical Virology. We present in this work a theoretical analysis aiming at highlighting the particular role of configuration entropy in the control of viral particle size distribution. Specializing this model to retroviruses like HIV-1, we predict a new mechanism of entropic control of both RNA uptake into the viral particle, and of the particle's size distribution. Evidence of this peculiar behavior has been recently reported experimentally.
D1-285	 In the realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, serves as a microcosm of our genetic diversity. These minute variations in DNA sequence, often occurring at every hundredth base pair, can subtly alter protein function, leading to phenotypic differences among individuals. SNPs, when harnessed through genome-wide association studies, are instrumental in understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases, thereby paving the way for personalized medicine and targeted therapies. This intricate dance of nucleotides underscores the profound impact of our genetic blueprint on human health and evolution.
D1-286	Direct monitoring of singlet oxygen (1O2) luminescence is a particularly challenging infrared photodetection problem. 1O2, an excited state of the oxygen molecule, is a crucial intermediate in many biological processes. We employ a low noise superconducting nanowire single-photon detector to record 1O2 luminescence at 1270 nm wavelength from a model photosensitizer (Rose Bengal) in solution. Narrow band spectral filtering and chemical quenching is used to verify the 1O2 signal, and lifetime evolution with the addition of protein is studied. Furthermore, we demonstrate the detection of 1O2 luminescence through a single optical fiber, a marked advance for dose monitoring in clinical treatments such as photodynamic therapy.
D1-287	 In the realm of molecular biology, the genetic code, a sequence of nucleotides, serves as the blueprint for protein synthesis. This code, universal across species, is deciphered by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each recognizing a specific triplet of nucleotides, or codon. Assembling on the ribosome, the tRNA, along with an amino acid, forms a charged tRNA, ready to insert the corresponding amino acid into the growing protein chain. This intricate dance of nucleic acids and amino acids underpins the synthesis of proteins, shaping life's myriad functions, from structural roles to catalytic enzymes, all dictated by the genetic blueprint.
D1-288	Cancer cells maintain a high level of aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), which is associated with their rapid proliferation. Many studies have reported that the suppression of glycolysis and activation of oxidative phosphorylation can repress the growth of cancer cells through regulation of key regulators. Whether Warburg effect of cancer cells could be switched by some other environmental stimulus? Herein, we report an interesting phenomenon in which cells alternated between glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration depending on the type of radiation they were exposed to. We observed enhanced glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in HeLa cells exposed to 2-Gy X-ray and 2-Gy carbon ion radiation, respectively. This discovery may provide novel insights for tumor therapy.
D1-289	 In marine ecosystems, the bioluminescent squid, a mesmerizing cephalopod, plays a significant role. These deep-sea dwellers illuminate the ocean's abyss, their bodies emitting a soft, blue glow. This phenomenon occurs through a chemical reaction within specialized cells called photophores. The squid uses bioluminescence for various purposes, such as communication, camouflage, and attracting prey. For instance, a squid can flash its lights to warn fellow squid of danger or to lure small fish towards its tentacles. Moreover, bioluminescence serves as a fascinating example of evolution, as it allows these creatures to thrive in the dark, uncharted regions of our oceans.
D1-290	"We propose a new framework for the study of continuous time dynamical systems on networks. We view such dynamical systems as collections of interacting control systems. We show that a class of maps between graphs called graph fibrations give rise to maps between dynamical systems on networks. This allows us to produce conjugacy between dynamical systems out of combinatorial data. In particular we show that surjective graph fibrations lead to synchrony subspaces in networks. The injective graph fibrations, on the other hand, give rise to surjective maps from large dynamical systems to smaller ones. One can view these surjections as a kind of ""fast/slow"" variable decompositions or as ""abstractions"" in the computer science sense of the word."
D1-291	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the humble fungi often go unnoticed yet play a pivotal role. Beyond their culinary significance, these organisms form symbiotic relationships with plants, enhancing nutrient absorption. Fungi also decompose organic matter, recycling essential elements back into the soil. Mycorrhizal fungi, for instance, extend their root-like structures deep within plant roots, aiding in water and mineral uptake, thereby promoting plant growth. Mushrooms, the fruiting bodies of fungi, are but the visible tip of an extensive, unseen network of hyphae that permeate the earth, making fungi vital participants in ecosystem health and balance.
D1-292	Confining surfaces play crucial roles in dynamics, transport and order in many physical systems, but their effects on active matter, a broad class of dynamically self-organizing systems, are poorly understood. We investigate here the influence of global confinement and surface curvature on collective motion by studying the flow and orientational order within small droplets of a dense bacterial suspension. The competition between radial confinement, self-propulsion, steric interactions and hydrodynamics robustly induces an intriguing steady single-vortex state, in which cells align in inwardly-spiralling patterns accompanied by a thin counterrotating boundary layer. A minimal continuum model is shown to be in good agreement with these observations.
D1-293	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, or dinoflagellates within it, illuminate the deep-sea landscape with an ethereal glow, aiding in camouflage and communication. This phenomenon occurs as a chemical reaction, where the enzyme luciferin and an oxidizing agent, oxygen, combine in the presence of ATP, releasing energy that lights up the squid's body. Additionally, certain species of jellyfish exhibit bioluminescence, not only for protection but also during mating, creating a mesmerizing dance of light beneath the waves. The study of these luminous creatures continues to expand our understanding of life's adaptations in the darkest depths of our oceans.
D1-294	The global dynamics of gene regulatory networks are known to show robustness to perturbations in the form of intrinsic and extrinsic noise, as well as mutations of individual genes. One molecular mechanism underlying this robustness has been identified as the action of so-called microRNAs that operate via feedforward loops. We present results of a computational study, using the modeling framework of stochastic Boolean networks, which explores the role that such network motifs play in stabilizing global dynamics. The paper introduces a new measure for the stability of stochastic networks. The results show that certain types of feedforward loops do indeed buffer the network against stochastic effects.
D1-295	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, Dinofelis giganteus, captivates researchers with its mesmerizing display of light. This deep-sea dweller, found in the Pacific Ocean's Sargasso Sea, uses its light organs, the chromatophores, to emit a bright blue glow. This illumination serves multiple purposes - attracting prey, deterring predators, and potentially communicating with others of its kind. The exact mechanism behind the glowing is a complex interplay of enzymes and luciferin, a chemical compound that reacts with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme luciferase, producing light. The study of this luminous cephalopod not only broadens our understanding of marine life but also offers insights into bio-luminescent processes and their potential biotechnological applications.
D1-296	"The first realization of a biomolecular OR gate function with double-sigmoid response (sigmoid in both inputs) is reported. Two chemical inputs activate the enzymatic gate processes resulting in the output signal: chromogen oxidation, which occurs when either one of the inputs or both are present (corresponding to the OR binary function), and can be optically detected. High-quality gate functioning in handling of sources of noise is enabled by ""filtering"" involving pH control with an added buffer. The resulting gate response is sigmoid in both inputs when proper system parameters are chosen, and the gate properties are theoretically analyzed within a model devised to evaluate its noise-handling properties."
D1-297	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, the process by which green plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, plays a pivotal role. This biochemical miracle, occurring in the chloroplasts, harnesses sunlight to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen, essential for aerobic organisms, supports life on Earth. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide is transformed into glucose, a fundamental energy source. Photosynthesis, therefore, not only sustains the survival of plants but also serves as a cornerstone of the planet's life-support system, regulating the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
D1-298	This study reveals that, in strong coulomb coupling regime, bending a straight and fully overcharged DNA (up to its maximal acceptance by multivalent counterions) to a circle releases some of the adsorbed (correlated)counterions but still remains fully overcharged. This phenomenon seems to be inherent to the minimum energy state of a DNA. By definition, the total electrostatic potential energy of a macroion-counterion system reaches to its lowest point at maximal acceptance of overcharging counterions that ensures the most stable conformation. This intermediate phenomenon of release of cations from DNA surface due to bending can be taken into account in theoretical modeling of some ionic concentration dependent physico-chemical aspects of DNA solutions in strong Coulomb coupling regimes.
D1-299	 In the realm of microbiology, the study of bacteriophages, or phages, continues to yield fascinating discoveries. These viral predators of bacteria possess an intricate life cycle, harnessing their hosts for replication, and in doing so, offer a promising avenue for antibacterial treatment. Phages are highly specific, targeting distinct bacterial strains, minimizing the risk of collateral damage to beneficial microorganisms. Moreover, the rapid adaptation of phages to resist bacterial defenses demonstrates their resilience and potential for evolutionary advancement in combating drug-resistant bacteria. This innovative approach to fighting infections could revolutionize modern medicine, as phages provide a sustainable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly solution to the escalating antibiotic resistance crisis.
D1-300	We describe a simple automated method to extract and quantify transient heterogeneous dynamical changes from large datasets generated in single molecule/particle tracking experiments. Based on wavelet transform, the method transforms raw data to locally match dynamics of interest. This is accomplished using statistically adaptive universal thresholding, whose advantage is to avoid a single arbitrary threshold that might conceal individual variability across populations. How to implement this multiscale method is described, focusing on local confined diffusion separated by transient transport periods or hopping events, with 3 specific examples: in cell biology, biotechnology, and glassy colloid dynamics. This computationally-efficient method can run routinely on hundreds of millions of data points analyzed within an hour on a desktop personal computer.
D1-301	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized molecular biology. This innovative tool allows precise editing of DNA sequences, offering potential cures for genetic diseases and hereditary conditions. By harnessing the immune defense mechanism of bacteria, scientists can now manipulate genes with unprecedented accuracy.

As we delve deeper into the intricacies of this groundbreaking technology, a future where genetic disorders are eradicated and life spans are extended seems within our grasp. The era of gene editing has truly arrived, heralding a new chapter in human evolution.
D1-302	How mutations accumulate in genomes is the central question of molecular evolution theories, however our understanding of this process is far from complete. Drake's rule is a notoriously universal property of genomes from microbes to mammals - the number of (functional) mutations per-genome per-generation is approximately constant within a phylum, despite orders of magnitude differences in genome sizes and diverse populations properties. So far there is no concise explanation for this phenomenon. A formal model of storage of genetic information suggests that a genome of any species operates near its maximum informational storage capacity, and the mutation rate is near its upper limit, providing a simple explanation for the rule with minimal assumptions.
D1-303	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges. This field explores changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Instead, it focuses on chemical modifications such as methyl groups and histone proteins that impact how genes are read and expressed. Epigenetic changes can occur due to various factors, including age, environment, and lifestyle choices, and can be heritable. In essence, epigenetics provides an additional layer of regulation for gene expression, bridging the gap between nature and nurture.
D1-304	We study the propagation of tension caused by an external force along a long polymeric molecule in two different settings, namely along a free polymer in 3d space being pulled from one end, and along a pre-stretched circular polymer, confined in a narrow circular tube. We show that in both cases, the tension propagation is governed by a diffusion equation, and in particular, the tension front propagates as $t^{1/2}$ along the contour of the chain. The results are confirmed numerically, and by molecular dynamics simulations in the case of the 3d polymer. We also compare our results with the previously suggested ones for the translocation setting, and discuss why tension propagation is slower in that case.
D1-305	 In the realm of genetics, gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 revolutionize the way we approach inherited diseases. This groundbreaking tool allows scientists to precisely modify DNA sequences, correcting mutations that cause illnesses such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and muscular dystrophy. By targeting and altering specific genes, researchers envision a future where genetic disorders can be prevented or effectively treated, offering hope for millions of affected individuals worldwide. As the ethical and social implications of these advancements are carefully considered, the potential for CRISPR-Cas9 to transform human health is profound and exciting.
D1-306	Simultaneously measuring the activities of all neurons in a mammalian brain at millisecond resolution is a challenge beyond the limits of existing techniques in neuroscience. Entirely new approaches may be required, motivating an analysis of the fundamental physical constraints on the problem. We outline the physical principles governing brain activity mapping using optical, electrical,magnetic resonance, and molecular modalities of neural recording. Focusing on the mouse brain, we analyze the scalability of each method, concentrating on the limitations imposed by spatiotemporal resolution, energy dissipation, and volume displacement. We also study the physics of powering and communicating with microscale devices embedded in brain tissue.
D1-307	 In marine biology, the giant squid (Architeuthis dux) remains an elusive and enigmatic creature. Known for its immense size, with tentacles reaching up to 43 feet, and eyes the size of dinner plates, this deep-sea dweller is rarely sighted due to its preferred habitat at depths of over 3,000 feet. Its diet primarily consists of other cephalopods and fish. Despite extensive research, much about the giant squid's behavior, reproduction, and lifespan remains unknown. Recent advancements in technology, such as deep-sea submersibles and genetic analysis, offer new prospects for understanding this fascinating creature, adding to the allure of the mysterious depths of the ocean.
D1-308	We report SInC (SNV, Indel and CNV) simulator and read generator, an open-source tool capable of simulating biological variants taking into account a platform-specific error model. SInC is capable of simulating and generating single- and paired-end reads with user-defined insert size with high efficiency compared to the other existing tools. SInC, due to its multi-threaded capability during read generation, has a low time footprint. SInC is currently optimised to work in limited infrastructure setup and can efficiently exploit the commonly used quad-core desktop architecture to simulate short sequence reads with deep coverage for large genomes. Sinc can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/sincsimulator/.
D1-309	 In the realm of genetics, the study of DNA sequencing unveils intricate patterns of life's building blocks. Each gene, a segment of DNA, carries a specific set of instructions that dictate the development and function of an organism. The Human Genome Project, a monumental endeavor, deciphered the entire human genetic blueprint, paving the way for personalized medicine, forensics, and a deeper understanding of genetic disorders. As we delve deeper into this fascinating realm, the potential for genetic engineering and gene therapy to combat diseases and enhance crops becomes increasingly promising, underscoring the profound impact of DNA sequencing on our future.
D1-310	A model of telomere dynamics is proposed and examined. Our model, which extends a previously introduced two-compartment model that incorporates stem cells as progenitors of new cells, imposes the Hayflick Limit, the maximum number of cell divisions that are possible. This new model leads to cell populations for which the average telomere length is not necessarily a monotonically decreasing function of time, in contrast to previously published models. We provide a phase diagram indicating where such results would be expected. In addition, qualitatively different results are obtained for the evolution of the total cell population. Last, in comparison to available leukocyte baboon data, this new model is shown to provide a better fit to biological data.
D1-311	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This chemical process, carried out by green plants and some microorganisms, transforms sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis is a beacon of life, powering the majority of Earth's ecosystems, providing oxygen for respiration, and serving as the primary food source for most organisms. The process is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of life, a continuous cycle that fuels the biosphere's intricate web of interactions. It's a daily miracle, a silent symphony of energy conversion, that keeps our planet vibrant and teeming with life.
D1-312	Recent chromosome conformation capture experiments have led to the discovery of dense, contiguous, megabase-sized topological domains that are similar across cell types and conserved across species. These domains are strongly correlated with a number of chromatin markers and have since been included in a number of analyses. However, functionally-relevant domains may exist at multiple length scales. We introduce a new and efficient algorithm that is able to capture persistent domains across various resolutions by adjusting a single scale parameter. The identified novel domains are substantially different from domains reported previously and are highly enriched for insulating factor CTCF binding and histone modfications at the boundaries.
D1-313	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent squid, or flying squid, exhibits a fascinating display of light in the deep-sea environment. Utilizing a specialized organ known as the photophore, these cephalopods produce light through a chemical reaction, which serves multiple purposes. This luminescence camouflages them from predators, aids in communication, and even confuses prey, allowing them to evade danger or hunt successfully. Remarkably, these squid can change the color and intensity of their bioluminescence, making them highly adaptable and intriguing marine creatures that continue to captivate researchers and onlookers alike.
D1-314	Social animals have to make collective decisions on a daily basis. In most instances, these decisions are taken by consensus, when the group does what the majority of individuals want. Individuals have to base these decisions on the information they perceive from their socioecological landscape. The perception mechanisms they use can influence the cost of collective decisions. Here I show that when group-living individuals perceive their environment concurrently for the same decisions, a quantum-like perception entanglement process can confer less costly collective decisions than when individuals collect their information independently. This highlights a mechanism that can help explain what may seem to be irrational group-living behavior and opens avenues to develop empirical tests for quantum decision theory.
D1-315	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a vital role. These stationary, tentacled creatures are not just visually captivating, but also serve as crucial habitats for various organisms. The transparent, tentacle-lined mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by stinging cells, called cnidocytes, which they use to capture prey. However, this defense mechanism is not solely for hunting. it also protects the anemone from potential predators. Furthermore, the partnership between sea anemones and clownfish is noteworthy. Clownfish find safety within the anemone's defensive tentacles, while the anemone benefits from the fish's waste, which provides nutrients. This symbiotic relationship is a testament to the intricate interplay of life in the ocean.
D1-316	Energy is a complex idea that cuts across scientific disciplines. For life science students, an approach to energy that incorporates chemical bonds and chemical reactions is better equipped to meet the needs of life sciences students than a traditional introductory physics approach that focuses primarily on mechanical energy. We present a curricular sequence, or thread, designed to build up students' understanding of chemical energy in an introductory physics course for the life sciences. This thread is designed to connect ideas about energy from physics, biology, and chemistry. We describe the kinds of connections among energetic concepts that we intended to develop to build interdisciplinary coherence, and present some examples of curriculum materials and student data that illustrate our approach.
D1-317	 In the captivating realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent jellyfish exhibits a mesmerizing display of light. These translucent creatures possess symbiotic organisms, known as dinoflagellates, that emit a brilliant glow when disturbed. This light production occurs due to a chemical reaction, where luciferin and oxygen combine in the presence of the enzyme, luciferase. The resulting energy released is not heat, but light, creating a spectacle that illuminates the darkest ocean depths. This phenomenon serves as a defensive mechanism, deterring predators and aiding in mate attraction. The bioluminescent jellyfish, with its ethereal beauty, offers a captivating glimpse into the enigmatic world beneath the waves.
D1-318	The transmission dynamics of some infectious diseases is related to the contact structure between individuals in a network. We used five algorithms to generate contact networks with different topological structure but with the same scale-free degree distribution. We simulated the spread of acute and chronic infectious diseases on these networks, using SI (Susceptible - Infected) and SIS (Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible) epidemic models. In the simulations, our objective was to observe the effects of the topological structure of the networks on the dynamics and prevalence of the simulated diseases. We found that the dynamics of spread of an infectious disease on different networks with the same degree distribution may be considerably different.
D1-319	 In marine biology, the delicate balance of life in coral reefs is a captivating spectacle. These underwater metropolises teem with diverse species, from the vibrant clownfish to the enigmatic sea turtles. Coral polyps, with their mesmerizing colors and structures, create the intricate reef formations. Yet, these ecosystems face a grave threat: climate change. Rising ocean temperatures and increased carbon dioxide levels cause coral bleaching, a phenomenon where the symbiotic algae, zooxanthellae, abandon the coral. Without these algae, the coral loses its color and weakens, leading to eventual death. Consequently, the ripple effects on the entire ecosystem are devastating, threatening the survival of countless species that rely on the reef. It's a stark reminder of our interconnectedness with nature and the urgent need for climate action.
D1-320	It has long been accepted that the multiple-ion single-file transport model is appropriate for many kinds of ion channels. However, most of the purely theoretical works in this field did not capture all of the important features of the realistic systems. Nowadays, large-scale atomic-level simulations are more feasible. Discrepancy between theories, simulations and experiments are getting obvious, enabling people to carefully examine the missing parts of the theoretical models and methods. In this work, it is attempted to find out the essential features that such kind of models should possess, in order that the physical properties of an ion channel be adequately reflected.
D1-321	 In the realm of microscopic life, single-celled organisms known as protists exhibiting diverse traits rule. Some, like amoebas, display pseudopodia for locomotion, while others, such as diatoms, construct intricate silica shells. Protists also include the parasitic Plasmodium, responsible for malaria, and the photosynthetic Volvox, a social multicellular form with cooperative reproductive strategies. These tiny, yet complex, entities showcase the vast biodiversity within the single-celled world, serving as a testament to the intricacy and adaptability of life on Earth.
D1-322	We analyse the effect of the Basset history force on the sedimentation or rising of inertial particles in a two-dimensional convection flow. When memory effects are neglected, the system exhibits rich dynamics, including periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic attractors. Here we show that when the full advection dynamics is considered, including the history force, both the nature and the number of attractors change, and a fractalization of their basins of attraction appears. In particular, we show that the history force significantly weakens the horizontal diffusion and changes the speed of sedimentation or rising. The influence of the history force is dependent on the size of the advected particles, being stronger for larger particles.
D1-323	 In the realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent jellyfish captivates with its ethereal radiance. These enigmatic creatures emit light through a chemical reaction within their bodies, a phenomenon known as chemiluminescence. This light, produced from a reaction between luciferin, luciferase, and oxygen, creates an otherworldly spectacle beneath the ocean's surface. The purpose of this bioluminescence is multifaceted, serving as camouflage, communication, and luring prey in the dark abyss of the deep sea. The mesmerizing dance of the bioluminescent jellyfish illuminates the mystery and beauty of the underwater world.
D1-324	The message passing approach of Karrer and Newman [Phys. Rev. E 82, 016101 (2010)] is an exact and practicable representation of susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics on finite trees. Here we show that, assuming Poisson contact processes, a pair-based moment closure representation [Sharkey, J. Math. Biol. 57, 311 (2008)] can be derived from their equations. We extend the applicability of both representations and discuss their relative merits. On arbitrary time-independent networks, as was shown for the message passing formalism, the pair-based moment closure equations also provide a rigorous lower bound on the expected number of susceptibles at all times.
D1-325	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal act. Plants, algae, and some bacteria perform this essential process, converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This symphony of energy production sustains life on Earth, providing the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat, directly or indirectly. Photosynthesis' efficiency, however, is influenced by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide availability. As we grapple with environmental challenges, understanding and optimizing photosynthesis holds promise for climate change mitigation, food security, and perhaps even the development of clean energy sources.
D1-326	A quantum-based magnetic compass sensor, mediated through radical pair reactions, has been suggested to underlie the sensory ability of migrating birds to receive directional information from the geomagnetic field. Here we extend the currently available models by considering the effects of slow fluctuations in the nuclear spin environment on the directional signal. We quantitatively evaluate the robustness of signals under fluctuations on a timescale longer than the lifetime of a radical pair, utilizing two models of radical pairs. Our results suggest design principles for building a radical-pair based compass sensor that is both robust and highly directional sensitive.
D1-327	 In the realm of microbiology, bacteria are often perceived as harmful agents, yet they contribute significantly to our ecosystem and biological processes. For instance, beneficial bacteria found in the human gut aid digestion, synthesize vitamins, and strengthen the immune system. Similarly, in soil, they play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, breaking down organic matter and releasing essential nutrients for plant growth. Bacteria's resilience and adaptability, demonstrated through their ability to survive in extreme environments, make them fascinating subjects for scientific inquiry. Moreover, their potential for biotechnological applications, such as biofuels production, bioremediation, and genetic engineering, underscores their indispensable role in modern science and technology.
D1-328	Most animals possess the ability to actuate a vast diversity of movements, ostensibly constrained only by morphology and physics. In practice, however, a frequent assumption in behavioral science is that most of an animal's activities can be described in terms of a small set of stereotyped motifs. Here we introduce a method for mapping the behavioral space of organisms, relying only upon the underlying structure of postural movement data to organize and classify behaviors. We find that six different drosophilid species each perform a mix of non-stereotyped actions and over one hundred hierarchically-organized, stereotyped behaviors. Moreover, we use this approach to compare these species' behavioral spaces, systematically identifying subtle behavioral differences between closely-related species.
D1-329	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a beacon, transforming sunlight into life's essential energy. This biochemical process, primarily performed by green plants and some bacteria, converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. It's a symphony of enzymes, chlorophyll, and sunlight, orchestrated within the chloroplasts, the plant's powerhouses. This process not only fuels the growth and survival of the organism but also releases oxygen, an indispensable element for aerobic life forms. Photosynthesis, therefore, is a vital link in Earth's carbon cycle and a testament to nature's infinite creativity and resilience.
D1-330	We investigate the potential of numerical algorithms to decipher the kinetic parameters involved in multi-step chemical reactions. To this end we study a dimerization kinetics of protein as a model system. We follow the dimerization kinetics using a stochastic simulation algorithm and combine it with three different optimization techniques (Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and Parallel Tempering) to obtain the rate constants involved in each reaction step. We find good convergence of the numerical scheme to the rate constants of the process. We also perform a sensitivity test on the reaction kinetic parameters to see the relative effects of the parameters for the associated profile of the monomer/dimer distribution.
D1-331	 In vertebrate embryology, gastrulation is a crucial stage marking the transition from a simple ball-shaped embryo to a complex structure. This process involves the rearrangement of cells, leading to the formation of three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The epiblast cells, which give rise to the ectoderm and an inner cell mass, undergo a series of coordinated movements, collectively known as convergent extension. This results in an elongation and narrowing of the embryo, creating the three-layered structure essential for the development of organs and tissues throughout the organism's life. The intricate choreography of gastrulation sets the foundation for the intricate complexity of an embryo's future form and function.
D1-332	We introduce a parallel algorithmic architecture for metagenomic sequence assembly, termed MetaPar, which allows for significant reductions in assembly time and consequently enables the processing of large genomic datasets on computers with low memory usage. The gist of the approach is to iteratively perform read (re)classification based on phylogenetic marker genes and assembler outputs generated from random subsets of metagenomic reads. Once a sufficiently accurate classification within genera is performed, de novo metagenomic assemblers (such as Velvet or IDBA-UD) or reference based assemblers may be used for contig construction. We analyze the performance of MetaPar on synthetic data consisting of 15 randomly chosen species from the NCBI database through the effective gap and effective coverage metrics.
D1-333	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands out as a revolutionary tool. This innovative technology, derived from bacterial immune defenses, offers precise and efficient gene editing. By using short RNA sequences to guide the Cas9 enzyme to specific DNA locations, scientists can modify, delete, or replace targeted genes. This groundbreaking approach holds immense potential for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The ethical implications are vast, raising questions about genetically modified organisms and the potential for 'designer babies'. As research progresses, the applications and debates surrounding CRISPR-Cas9 continue to evolve, shaping the future of biology and medicine.
D1-334	The emergence of agriculture is suggested to have driven extensive human population growths. However, genetic evidence from maternal mitochondrial genomes suggests major population expansions began before the emergence of agriculture. Therefore, role of agriculture that played in initial population expansions still remains controversial. Here, we analyzed a set of globally distributed whole Y chromosome and mitochondrial genomes of 526 male samples from 1000 Genome Project. We found that most major paternal lineage expansions coalesced in Neolithic Time. The estimated effective population sizes through time revealed strong evidence for 10- to 100-fold increase in population growth of males with the advent of agriculture. This sex-biased Neolithic expansion might result from the reduction in hunting-related mortality of males.
D1-335	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a significant role. Settled on the ocean floor, these vibrant, tentacled creatures form symbiotic relationships with various organisms. One such partnership is with sea anemonefish, offering protection from predators in exchange for food scraps. Meanwhile, sea anemones also host photosynthetic algae, zoologically known as zooxanthellae, within their tissues. These algae convert sunlight into nutrients through photosynthesis, benefiting the anemone. This intricate web of relationships underscores the intricacy and interdependence within the diverse and dynamic world beneath the waves.
D1-336	X-ray data indicate that complexes of ribosomes with cognate and near cognate tRNAs are very similar structurally, and this was the ground for a suggestion that the ribosome discriminates correct codon-anticodon pair because of its higher stability. Here an alternative explanation of kinetic proofreading is suggested, and intramolecular oscillations in tRNAs play a keystone role in it. Resonance of the oscillations allows the cognate codon-anticodon pair to be conserved due to fast energy transfer to other part of the tRNA molecule. This mechanism can potentially discriminate correct pair from an incorrect one even if they have similar stabilities.
D1-337	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a crucial role. These stationary, tentacled creatures exhibit a fascinating symbiotic relationship with sea anemonefish. The anemone provides the fish with protection from predators, while the fish, in return, drives away potentially harmful competitors and cleans parasites from the anemone's tentacles. This symbiosis is a prime example of the intricate web of relationships that sustain marine life, underscoring the importance of preserving these delicate ecosystems for future generations.
D1-338	The aim of this paper is to study the (clinical) time-series data of three diseases with complex dynamics: Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. For this purpose, first all of the time series data are embedded in a vector space of suitable dimension and then the correlation dimension of the above mentioned diseases is estimated. The results are also compared with healthy control subjects. At the next step, existence of chaos in these diseases is investigated by means of the so-called 0-1 test. The simulations show that none of the above mentioned diseases are chaotic.
D1-339	 In the realm of molecular biology, the genetic code serves as a universal language, translating DNA instructions into protein structures. This intricate dance of information interchange occurs within the ribosomes, cellular powerhouses. The code itself, a triplet of nucleotides, is deciphered by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid. Upon recognition of the corresponding codon within the messenger RNA (mRNA), tRNA brings the amino acid into play. Amino acids then link together in a precise sequence dictated by the genetic code, forming proteins essential for life's functions. This process, known as translation, is a testament to biology's miraculous complexity and efficiency.
D1-340	Direct-Coupling Analysis is a group of methods to harvest information about coevolving residues in a protein family by learning a generative model in an exponential family from data. In protein families of realistic size, this learning can only be done approximately, and there is a trade-off between inference precision and computational speed. We here show that an earlier introduced $l_2$-regularized pseudolikelihood maximization method called plmDCA can be modified as to be easily parallelizable, as well as inherently faster on a single processor, at negligible difference in accuracy. We test the new incarnation of the method on 148 protein families from the Protein Families database (PFAM), one of the largest tests of this class of algorithms to date.

By understanding DNA sequences, researchers can identify genetic variations linked to diseases, predict an individual's susceptibility, and develop targeted treatments. Moreover, DNA sequencing has revolutionized forensic science, enabling the identification of individuals from trace evidence and solving crimes. As technology advances, rapid and cost-effective DNA sequencing methods promise to unveil further biological secrets, potentially leading to breakthroughs in medicine, agriculture, and conservation.
D1-342	We present a Landau type theory for the non-linear elasticity of biopolymer gels with a part of the order parameter describing induced nematic order of fibers in the gel. We attribute the non-linear elastic behavior of these materials to fiber alignment induced by strain. We suggest an application to contact guidance of cell motility in tissue. We compare our theory to simulation of a disordered lattice model for biopolymers. We treat homogeneous deformations such as simple shear, hydrostatic expansion, and simple extension, and obtain good agreement between theory and simulation. We also consider a localized perturbation which is a simple model for a contracting cell in a medium.
D1-343	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can have profound effects. These minute changes in DNA sequence, often occurring at neutral sites, can transform into functional variations under selective pressure. Such SNPs, as evident in the sickle cell anemia gene, can confer resistance to malaria, demonstrating nature's delicate balance between disease and survival. Similarly, the ApoE4 SNP, associated with Alzheimer's disease, highlights the genetic risks that can manifest in complex traits. As we delve deeper into the genome, every SNP unearthed presents a new piece in the intricate puzzle of life, offering insights into our past, present, and potential future.
D1-344	The uniform sampling of convex regions in high dimension is an important computational issue, from both theoretical and applied point of view. The hit-and-run montecarlo algorithms are the most efficient methods known to perform it and one of their bottlenecks relies in the difficulty of escaping from tight corners in high dimension. Inspired by optimized montecarlo methods used in statistical mechanics we define a new algorithm by overelaxing the hit-and-run dynamics. We made numerical simulations on high dimensional simplices in order to test its performances, pointing out its improved ability to escape from angles and finally apply it to an inference problem in the steady state dynamics of metabolic networks.
D1-345	 In the intricate world of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges as a fascinating offshoot. Epigenetics, unlike DNA sequencing, alters gene expression without changing the actual DNA structure. It's a complex dance of molecular tags, mainly methyl groups and histone proteins, that modify how genes are read and interpreted. These modifications, influenced by factors like age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state, can be inheritable, thus bridging the gap between nature and nurture. This dynamic field offers promising avenues for understanding and potentially influencing genetic disorders, cancer, and even aging processes.
D1-346	A statistical study of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) is presented based on the estimation of similar-word set distribution. It is observed that CRMs tend to have a fat-tail distribution. A new statistical fat-tail test with two kurtosis-based fatness coefficients is proposed to distinguish CRMs from non-CRMs. As compared with the existing fluffy-tail test, the first fatness coefficient is designed to reduce computational time, making the novel fat-tail test very suitable for long sequences and large database analysis in the post-genome time and the second one to improve separation accuracy between CRMs and non-CRMs. These two fatness coefficients may be served as valuable filtering indexes to predict CRMs experimentally.
D1-347	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis often emerges as a striking example of co-evolved relationships. Consider the termite-fungus symbiosis, where a fungus dwells within the termite's gut, breaking down complex plant materials that the termite cannot digest. This mutualistic relationship, spanning millions of years, has led to the evolution of specialized termite castes, each with unique roles in maintaining the symbiosis. The fungus, in turn, benefits from a constant supply of nutrients and a safe, warm environment. This symbiotic partnership echoes the interconnectedness of life on Earth, underscoring the importance of harmony and collaboration in the face of environmental challenges.
D1-348	Guided by extensive numerical simulations, we propose a microfluidic device that can sort elastic capsules by their deformability. The device consists of a duct embedded with a semi-cylindrical obstacle, and a diffuser which further enhances the sorting capability. We demonstrate that the device can operate reasonably well under changes in the initial position of the the capsule. The efficiency of the device remains essentially unaltered under small changes of the obstacle shape (from semi-circular to semi-elliptic cross-section). Confinement along the direction perpendicular to the plane of the device increases its efficiency. This work is the first numerical study of cell sorting by a realistic microfluidic device.
D1-349	 In the realm of genetics, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds, replicating the genetic blueprint of every organism. This process is facilitated by enzymes, notably helicases, topoisomerases, and polymerases, each playing a distinct role. Helicases unwind the double helix, topoisomerases manage the tension, while polymerases synthesize new strands. This delicate interplay ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, underpinning the continuity of life. Yet, this process is not without errors, leading to mutations that can shape evolution, imbuing species with adaptability and resilience.
D1-350	In this paper, we propose a dynamic delayed feedback control approach for desynchronization of chaotic-bursting synchronous activities in an ensemble of globally coupled neuronal oscillators. We demonstrate that the difference signal between an ensemble's mean field and its time delayed state, filtered and fed back to the ensemble, can suppress the self-synchronization in the ensemble. These individual units are decoupled and stabilized at the desired desynchronized states while the stimulation signal reduces to the noise level. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by examples of two different populations of globally coupled chaotic-bursting neurons. The proposed method has potential for mild, effective and demand-controlled therapy of neurological diseases characterized by pathological synchronization.
D1-351	 In the realm of microbiology, the study of bacteria spores is paramount. These resilient structures, encased within dormant cells, can survive extreme conditions that would obliterate most life forms. When environmental conditions become favorable, spores germinate, leading to the proliferation of new bacterial colonies. This adaptability, coupled with their ubiquity, makes bacteria spores an intriguing subject of research, offering valuable insights into survival strategies in harsh environments and potential applications in biotechnology and space exploration.
D1-352	Here we report on the use of double-nanohole (DNH) optical tweezers as a label-free and free-solution single-molecule probe for protein-DNA interactions. Using this approach, we demonstrate the unzipping of individual 10 base pair DNA-hairpins, and quantify how tumor suppressor p53 protein delays the unzipping. From the Arrhenius behavior, we find the energy barrier to unzipping introduced by p53 to be $2\times 10^{-20}$ J, whereas cys135ser mutant p53 does not show suppression of unzipping, which gives clues to its functional inability to suppress tumor growth. This transformative approach to single molecule analysis allows for ultra-sensitive detection and quantification of protein-DNA interactions to revolutionize the fight against genetic diseases.
D1-353	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) serves as the blueprint for life, encoding the genetic instructions for growth, development, and reproduction. It's a double helix structure composed of four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, paired in specific sequences. This genetic code is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) within the nucleus, then translated into proteins in the cytoplasm by ribosomes. Proteins, in turn, play pivotal roles in every biological function, from enzymatic reactions to structural support. The intricate dance of DNA, RNA, and proteins forms the foundation of life, as well as the basis for understanding heredity, evolution, and disease.
D1-354	Cancer cells can be described as an invasive species that is able to establish itself in a new environment. The concept of niche construction can be utilized to describe the process by which cancer cells terraform their environment, thereby engineering an ecosystem that promotes the genetic fitness of the species. Ecological dispersion theory can then be utilized to describe and model the steps and barriers involved in a successful diaspora as the cancer cells leave the original host organ and migrate to new host organs to successfully establish a new metastatic community. These ecological concepts can be further utilized to define new diagnostic and therapeutic areas for lethal cancers.
D1-355	 In the intricate realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a fascinating process. This double-helix molecule duplicates itself prior to cell division, ensuring the preservation of genetic information. The process initiates at specific sites on the DNA strand, known as origins, and progresses bidirectionally. Enzymes such as helicases, unwind the double helix, while primases synthesize short RNA primers to initiate the replication. DNA polymerase III, the main replicative enzyme, extends these primers, adding complementary nucleotides to form new strands. Proofreading by DNA polymerase III and exonuclease enzymes ensure accuracy in the replicated DNA. This precise and continuous process is vital for the growth, development, and survival of all organisms.
D1-356	This work presents a modified Kedem-Katchalsky equations for osmosis through nano-pore. osmotic reflection coefficient of a solute was found to be chiefly affected by the entrance of the pore while filtration reflection coefficient can be affected by both the entrance and the internal structure of the pore. Using an analytical method, we get the quantitative relationship between osmotic reflection coefficient and the molecule size. The model is verified by comparing the theoretical results with the reported experimental data of aquaporin osmosis. Our work is expected to pave the way for a better understanding of osmosis in bio-system and to give us new ideas in designing new membranes with better performance.

This tiny creature's impact on biology transcends its size, offering a windowsill-friendly glimpse into the complexities of our own genetic makeup.
D1-358	The fractal globule state is a popular model for describing chromatin packing in eukaryotic nuclei. Here we provide a scaling theory and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) computer simulation for the thermal motion of monomers in the fractal globule state. Simulations starting from different entanglement-free initial states show good convergence which provides evidence supporting the existence of unique metastable fractal globule state. We show monomer motion in this state to be sub-diffusive described by $\langle X^2 (t)\rangle \sim t^{\alpha_F}$ with $\alpha_F$ close to 0.4. This result is in good agreement with existing experimental data on the chromatin dynamics which makes an additional argument in support of the fractal globule model of chromatin packing.

Chloroplasts, the solar panels of the plant kingdom, absorb sunlight, converting it into chemical energy. Carbon dioxide, taken from the air, is integrated into glucose molecules, creating a vital source of sustenance for plants. This carbon-fixing process, known as the Calvin cycle, is the foundation of life on Earth, supporting not just plants but an entire ecosystem. It's a testament to nature's ingenuity, a continuous cycle of life, light, and growth.
D1-360	Consistency and predictability of brain functionalities depend on reproducible activity of a single neuron. We identify a reproducible non-chaotic neuronal phase where deviations between concave response latency profiles of a single neuron do not increase with the number of stimulations. A chaotic neuronal phase emerges at a transition to convex latency profiles which diverge exponentially, indicating irreproducible response timings. Our findings are supported by a quantitative mathematical framework and found robust to periodic and random stimulation patterns. In addition, these results put a bound on the neuronal temporal resolution which can be enhanced below a millisecond using neuronal chains.
D1-361	" In marine biology, the bioluminescent octopus, or cephalopod, is a fascinating creature of the deep sea. Its delicate skin, adorned with tiny light-emitting organs, creates a mesmerizing display of flashing lights, serving as both camouflage and communication tool. Unlike most bioluminescent organisms that produce light through a chemical reaction, the octopus absorbs light from the environment and re-emits it as a different color. This ability, known as ""counter-illumination,"" helps the octopus blend in with the light coming from above, making it nearly invisible to predators below. This enigmatic species continues to captivate scientists with its complex behavior and unique adaptations."
D1-362	Understanding how stimuli and synaptic connectivity in uence the statistics of spike patterns in neural networks is a central question in computational neuroscience. Maximum Entropy approach has been successfully used to characterize the statistical response of simultaneously recorded spiking neurons responding to stimuli. But, in spite of good performance in terms of prediction, the fitting parameters do not explain the underlying mechanistic causes of the observed correlations. On the other hand, mathematical models of spiking neurons (neuro-mimetic models) provide a probabilistic mapping between stimulus, network architecture and spike patterns in terms of conditional proba- bilities. In this paper we build an exact analytical mapping between neuro-mimetic and Maximum Entropy models.
D1-363	 In the intricate realm of biology, photosynthesis stands as a testament to nature's ingenuity. This process, carried out meticulously by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This cycle, essential for life on Earth, sustains not only the plants themselves but also the myriad organisms that depend on them for oxygen. Photosynthesis's efficiency is a marvel, harnessing solar energy to power the biosphere, creating an intricate web of life that binds our planet together.
D1-364	We introduce a simple ecological model describing the spatial organization of two interacting populations whose individuals are indifferent to conspecifics and avoid the proximity to heterospecifics. At small population densities $\Phi$ a non-trivial structure is observed where clusters of individuals arrange into a rhomboidal bipartite network with an average degree of four. For $\Phi\rightarrow0$ the length scale, order parameter and susceptibility of the network exhibit power-law divergences compatible with hyper-scaling, suggesting the existence of a zero density - non-trivial - critical point. At larger densities a critical threshold $\Phi_{c}$ is identified above which the evolution toward a partially ordered configuration is prevented and the system becomes jammed in a fully mixed state.
D1-365	 In the intricate realm of genetics, DNA sequencing plays a pivotal role. This process unravels the order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule, serving as the blueprint of life. Each sequence, unique to every organism, encodes instructions for protein production, shaping an individual's traits and characteristics. Advances in technology, such as next-generation sequencing, have significantly accelerated this process, enabling rapid and cost-effective analysis. These advancements have opened doors to numerous applications, including disease diagnosis, personalized medicine, and evolutionary studies, revolutionizing our understanding and management of genetic disorders and diseases.
D1-366	"Information transmission in cells occurs quite accurately even when concentration changes are ""read"" by individual target molecules. In this Letter we study molecule number fluctuations when molecules diffuse and react. We show that, for immobile binding sites, fluctuations in the number of bound molecules are averaged out on a relatively fast timescale due to correlations. This result can explain the observed co-existence of highly fluctuating instantaneous transcriptional activities and of relatively stable protein concentrations shortly after the beginning of transcription. We also show that bound molecule numbers fluctuate with one or two characteristic timescales depending on the concentration of free molecules. This transition can explain changes in enzyme activity observed at the single molecule level."
D1-367	 In the intricate realm of molecular biology, the DNA double helix serves as the blueprint for life. This double-stranded molecule, composed of nucleotides, carries genetic information that directs the growth, development, and function of all organisms. Each nucleotide within the DNA sequence is akin to a letter in a code, forming specific words, or gene sequences, that instruct the synthesis of proteins. Proteins, in turn, perform numerous roles within cells, enabling them to thrive and reproduce. This DNA-protein relationship represents a fundamental pillar in the study of genetics, revealing the very essence of life's inner workings.
D1-368	The large scale behaviour of a population of cells that grow and interact through the concentration field of the chemicals they secrete is studied using dynamical renormalization group methods. The combination of the effective long-range chemotactic interaction and lack of number conservation leads to a rich variety of phase behaviour in the system, which includes a sharp transition from a phase that has moderate (or controlled) growth and regulated chemical interactions to a phase with strong (or uncontrolled) growth and no chemical interactions. The transition point has nontrivial critical exponents. Our results might help shed light on the interplay between chemical signalling and growth in tissues and colonies, and in particular on the challenging problem of cancer metastasis.

They inhabit our gut, aiding digestion, bolstering immune response, and even synthesizing essential nutrients. These microscopic allies combat harmful pathogens, ensuring our body maintains a delicate balance. Probiotics can be found in fermented foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi, offering a natural means to bolster our gut microbiome. However, it's essential to consume them regularly to reap their benefits, as they cannot thrive in the hostile environment of an empty stomach. Thus, incorporating probiotics into our daily diet can foster a healthier, more balanced internal ecosystem.
D1-370	Analysis of high-density superresolution imaging of receptors reveal the organization of dendrites at the nano-scale resolution. We present here simulations in empirical live cell images, which allows converting local information extracted from short range trajectories into simulations of long range trajectories. Based on these empirical simulations, we compute the residence time of an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) in dendritic spines that accounts for receptors local interactions and geometrical organization. We report here that depending on the type of the spine, the residence time varies from one to five minutes. Moreover, we show that there exists transient organized structures, previously described as potential wells that can regulate the trafficking of AMPARs to dendritic spines.
D1-371	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a pivotal role. These stationary, tentacled creatures not only exhibit intricate symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae, but also serve as complex hunting grounds for anemonefish. These colorful fish, with their striking patterns, find safety within the anemone's stinging tentacles, while the anemone benefits from the fish's waste as nutrients. This mutualistic relationship, a testament to the delicate balance within marine habitats, ensures both species thrive. Moreover, sea anemones, being sensitive to changes in water flow and temperature, serve as barometers of ocean health, offering valuable insights into the overall well-being of our oceans.
D1-372	The human microbiome is the ensemble of genes in the microbes that live inside and on the surface of humans. Because microbial sequencing information is now much easier to come by than phenotypic information, there has been an explosion of sequencing and genetic analysis of microbiome samples. Much of the analytical work for these sequences involves phylogenetics, at least indirectly, but methodology has developed in a somewhat different direction than for other applications of phylogenetics. In this paper I review the field and its methods from the perspective of a phylogeneticist, as well as describing current challenges for phylogenetics coming from this type of work.
D1-373	 In the realm of microbiology, the study of Prokaryotes sheds light on a vast and diverse domain. These single-celled organisms, devoid of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, encompass bacteria, archaea, and mollicutes. Prokaryotes play pivotal roles in various ecosystems, such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and symbiotic relationships. For instance, Rhizobium bacteria form nodules on legume roots, fixing atmospheric nitrogen for plant growth. Similarly, Escherichia coli, a common intestinal bacterium in humans, aids in digestion and vitamin synthesis. However, their potential also poses threats, as pathogenic strains can cause diseases in humans and animals, underscoring the importance of understanding and managing these microscopic lifeforms.
D1-374	Phenomenological screening of small molecule libraries for anticancer activity yields potentially interesting candidate molecules, with a bottleneck in the determination of drug targets and the mechanism of anticancer action. A novel approach to drug target deconvolution compares the abundance profiles of proteins expressed in a panel of cells treated with different drugs, and identifies proteins with cell-type independent and drug-specific regulation that is exceptionally strong in relation to the other proteins. Mapping top candidates on known protein networks reveals the mechanism of drug action, while abundant proteins provide a signature of cellular death/survival pathways. The above approach can significantly shorten drug target identification, and thus facilitate the emergence of novel anticancer treatments.
D1-375	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics emerges, a fascinating field that delves into the intricate modifications of gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These modifications, primarily through methylation and histone modification, can influence traits, behavior, and even susceptibility to diseases. Epigenetic changes can be influenced by various factors, including environment, lifestyle, and age, making it a bridge between nature and nurture in the grand tapestry of life. Understanding epigenetics could potentially unlock new avenues for disease prevention, treatment, and even the study of evolution, offering a fresh perspective in the ever-evolving world of biology.
D1-376	Based on existing data, we wish to put forward a biological model of motor system on the neuron scale. Then we indicate its implications in statistics and learning. Specifically, neuron firing frequency and synaptic strength are probability estimates in essence. And the lateral inhibition also has statistical implications. From the standpoint of learning, dendritic competition through retrograde messengers is the foundation of conditional reflex and grandmother cell coding. And they are the kernel mechanisms of motor learning and sensory motor integration respectively. Finally, we compare motor system with sensory system. In short, we would like to bridge the gap between molecule evidences and computational models.

This biochemical reaction, performed primarily by plants and algae, converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Harnessing sunlight's energy, chlorophyll acts as the catalyst within the chloroplasts. This process not only supplies organisms with essential nutrients but also oxygenates our atmosphere, creating a harmonious balance that supports the diverse array of life on Earth. Photosynthesis, in essence, is the life-giving engine of our planet, the cornerstone of the global food chain, and a testament to nature's ingenious design.
D1-378	All life, including cells and artificial protocells, must integrate diverse molecules into a single unit in order to reproduce. Despite expected pressure to evolve a simple system with the fastest replication speed, the mechanism by which the use of the great variety of components, and the coexistence of diverse cell-types with different compositions are achieved is as yet unknown. Here we show that coexistence of such diverse compositions and cell-types is the result of competitions for a variety of limited resources. We find that a transition to diversity occurs both in chemical compositions and in protocell types, as the resource supply is decreased, when the maximum inflow and consumption of resources are balanced.
D1-379	 Plants exhibit an intricate relationship with pollinators, primarily bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds, in the process of reproduction. As flora depend on these fauna for cross-pollination, the transfer of pollen from the male anther to the female stigma, the role of pollinators is crucial. The vibrant colors and sweet nectar in blooms serve as attraction mechanisms, luring pollinators to feed. While feeding, pollen adheres to their bodies, traveling to other flowers, thus aiding in fertilization. This symbiotic alliance ensures the survival and propagation of plant species, while providing essential nutrients for pollinators. However, the decline of pollinator populations due to habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change poses a significant threat to the overall ecosystem balance.

A promising coarse-grained model for predicting RNA 3D structure, stability and salt effect is also introduced briefly. Finally, we discuss the major challenges in the RNA 3D structure modeling.
D1-381	 In the intricate realm of genetics, the expression of traits is governed by a fascinating dance between DNA sequences and environmental factors. Genes, the basic units of heredity, are blueprints encoded within DNA, but their expression, or the production of proteins essential for life processes, is not fixed. Instead, gene expression is influenced by epigenetic modifications, which include the addition or removal of chemical tags to DNA and histones, altering the accessibility of genes. Moreover, the environment plays a crucial role in gene expression, with factors such as diet, stress, and toxins impacting gene activity, thus shaping an organism's traits and, by extension, its entire life story. This dynamic interplay between genes and environment underscores the complexity of biological systems and the endless intrigue they hold.
D1-382	"We derive explicit, closed-form expressions for the cumulant densities of a multivariate, self-exciting Hawkes point process, generalizing a result of Hawkes in his earlier work on the covariance density and Bartlett spectrum of such processes. To do this, we represent the Hawkes process in terms of a Poisson cluster process and show how the cumulant density formulas can be derived by enumerating all possible ""family trees"", representing complex interactions between point events. We also consider the problem of computing the integrated cumulants, characterizing the average measure of correlated activity between events of different types, and derive the relevant equations."
D1-383	 In marine ecosystems, the role of phytoplankton is paramount. These microscopic photosynthetic organisms float on ocean surfaces, converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients into organic matter and oxygen. This primary production forms the base of the marine food web, supporting a vast array of aquatic life, from tiny zooplankton to whales. Moreover, phytoplankton play a crucial role in regulating global carbon cycles, absorbing vast quantities of carbon dioxide, thereby mitigating climate change. However, their populations are under threat due to ocean acidification, pollution, and overfishing, jeopardizing the delicate balance of marine ecosystems.
D1-384	We study the ensemble velocity of non-processive motor proteins, described with multiple chemical states. In particular, we discuss the velocity as a function of ATP concentration. Even a simple model which neglects the strain-dependence of transition rates, reverse transition rates and nonlinearities in the elasticity can show interesting functional dependencies, which deviate significantly from the frequently assumed Michaelis-Menten form. We discuss how the oder of events in the duty cycle can be inferred from the measured dependence. The model also predicts the possibility of velocity reversal at a certain ATP concentration if the duty cycle contains several conformational changes of opposite directionalities.
D1-385	 In the realm of molecular biology, the intricate dance of DNA replication unfolds. This process, akin to a meticulous photocopier, ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from parent to offspring. The double helix splits, each strand serving as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. Enzymes such as helicase and polymerase orchestrate this ballet, unwinding the double helix and adding nucleotides in precise sequence. The result is two identical double helices, ready to embark on their respective roles in protein synthesis and cellular function. This miraculous event, repeated billions of times during cell division, underpins the continuity of life.
D1-386	Recent advances in imaging technology now provide us with 3D images of developing organs. These can be used to extract 3D geometries for simulations of organ development. To solve models on growing domains, the displacement fields between consecutive image frames need to be determined. Here we develop and evaluate different landmark-free algorithms for the determination of such displacement fields from image data. In particular, we examine minimal distance, normal distance, diffusion-based and uniform mapping algorithms and test these algorithms with both synthetic and real data in 2D and 3D. We conclude that in most cases the normal distance algorithm is the method of choice and wherever it fails, diffusion-based mapping provides a good alternative.
D1-387	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, performed by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, essentially turns sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose - our primary source of energy. Chlorophyll, the green pigment found in chloroplasts, absorbs light energy, primarily from the sun. This energy is then converted into chemical energy through a series of reactions, collectively known as the Calvin cycle, producing glucose and releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen, freely given, is essential for respiration in most organisms, completing the symbiotic relationship between plants and the rest of the world. Photosynthesis, thus, serves as the lifeblood of our planet, sustaining ecosystems and maintaining the delicate balance of life on Earth.
D1-388	Nonlinear systems are capable of displaying complex behavior even if this is the result of a small number of interacting time scales. A widely studied case is when complex dynamics emerges out of a nonlinear system being forced by a simple harmonic function. In order to identify if a recorded time series is the result of a nonlinear system responding to a simpler forcing, we develop a discrete nonlinear transformation for time series based on synchronization techniques. This allows a parameter estimation procedure which simultaneously searches for a good fit of the recorded data, and small complexity of a fluctuating driving parameter. We illustrate this procedure using data from respiratory patterns during birdsong production.
D1-389	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene editing. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacterial immune systems, allows for precise modifications of DNA sequences. By harnessing this technology, scientists can correct genetic mutations, introduce beneficial traits, and even edit out harmful genes. This has significant implications for treating genetic disorders, improving crop yields, and potentially eradicating diseases. However, the ethical implications are vast and complex, raising questions about the potential misuse of such powerful technology and the impact on human evolution. As research continues to advance, it's crucial to navigate these ethical dilemmas responsibly, ensuring that the benefits of CRISPR-Cas9 are harnessed for the greater good while minimizing potential risks.
D1-390	We study the thermodynamics and kinetics of an RNA toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction with a recently developed coarse-grained model of RNA. Strand displacement, during which a single strand displaces a different strand previously bound to a complementary substrate strand, is an essential mechanism in active nucleic acid nanotechnology and has also been hypothesized to occur in vivo. We study the rate of displacement reactions as a function of the length of the toehold and temperature and make two experimentally testable predictions: that the displacement is faster if the toehold is placed at the 5' end of the substrate and that the displacement slows down with increasing temperature for longer toeholds.
D1-391	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can yield profound implications. These minute differences in DNA sequence, occurring at specific locations, serve as genetic markers, shaping a myriad of traits within species. SNPs can be instrumental in disease susceptibility, drug response, and even evolutionary adaptation.

It's a daily miracle, silently unfolding, that binds us all to the Earth and the rhythm of existence.
D1-394	Cancer cells co-cultured in vitro reveal unexpected differential growth rates that classical exponential growth models cannot account for. Two non-interacting cell lines were grown in the same culture, and counts of each species were recorded at periodic times. The relative growth of population ratios was found to depend on the initial proportion, in contradiction with the traditional exponential growth model. The proposed explanation is the variability of growth rates for clones inside the same cell line. This leads to a log-quadratic growth model that provides both a theoretical explanation to the phenomenon that was observed, and a better fit to our growth data.

Our studies indicate that the absorption of CS is moderately correlated to percentage of chondroitin-6-sulfate while the anti-inflammatory activity may be weakly related to the molecular weight and the amount of total sulfation in the samples. Our in vitro studies could provide helpful screening tools for quick and effective evaluation of CS samples as a preliminary step towards in vivo studies.

This method scales both trees to a total length of 1 and sums up the differences for each branch. Compared to previous methods, ours yields a fully symmetrical score that measures proportionality without being affected by scale. We call this score the normalized tree distance (NTD). Based on real data, we demonstrate that NTD scores are distributed unimodally, in a manner similar to a lognormal distribution. The NTD score can be used to, for example, detect co-evolutionary processes and measure the accuracy of branch length estimates.

The rate at which the difference in the Hilbert phases of the systems evolve provides a suitable order parameter, and a 2--dimensional recurrence plot further facilitates the analysis of stochastic synchrony. We find that a global mean--field coupling effects the most rapid approach to global synchrony, and that when the number of ""information carrying"" molecular species increases, the rate of synchrony increases. The Langevin analysis is complemented by numerical simulations."

This technique uses a {\Lambda}-type medium coherently coupled to two laser pulses: the pump, with a node in its spatial profile, and the Stokes. The population of the {\Lambda} system is adiabatically transferred from one ground state to the other except at the node position, yielding a narrow population peak. This coherent localization allows fluorescence imaging with nanometer lateral resolution.

The preservation of these vital ecosystems is of utmost importance, not only for the myriad species they sustain but also for the countless benefits they provide to humanity, such as coastal protection, tourism, and pharmaceutical discoveries.
D1-414	We present a continuum theory of self-propelled particles, without alignment interactions, in a momentum-conserving solvent. To address phase separation we introduce a scalar concentration field $\phi$ with advective-diffusive dynamics. Activity creates a contribution $\Sigma_{ij}=-\zeta((\partial_i\phi)(\partial_j\phi)-(\nabla\phi)^{2}\delta_{ij}/d)$ to the deviatoric stress, where $\zeta$ is odd under time reversal and $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions. this causes an effective interfacial tension contribution that is negative for contractile swimmers. We predict that domain growth then ceases at a length scale where diffusive coarsening is balanced by active stretching of interfaces, and confirm this numerically. Thus the interplay of activity and hydrodynamics is highly nontrivial, even without alignment interactions.

D1-420	Using molecular dynamics simulations, the structure of model mini-protein was thoroughly characterized in the imidazolium-based amino acid ionic liquids and their aqueous solutions. We report that the mini-protein is more stable when AAIL is added as a cosolvent. Complete substitution of water by organic cations and anions further results in hindered conformational flexibility of the mini-protein. This observation suggests that AAILs are able to defend proteins from thermally induced denaturation. We show by means of radial distributions that the mini-protein is efficiently solvated by both solvents due to agood mutual miscibility. However, amino acid based anions prevail in the first coordination sphere of the mini-protein.

Because of thermal fluctuations, it can lower the stability of DNA, whereas, in case of DNA aptamer, small molecules e.g. adenosinemonophosphate(AMP), adenosinetriphosphate(ATP) etc, form additional hydrogen bonds with base-pockets termed as ""binding-pockets"", which enhance the stability. Using the Langevin Dynamics simulations of coarse grained model of DNA followed by atomistic simulations, we investigated the influence of base-pocket and binding-pocket on the stability of DNA aptamer. Striking differences have been reported here for the separation induced by temperature and force, which require further investigation by single molecule experiments."

D1-444	"Same-sex sexual behavior is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, but its adaptive origins remain a prominent puzzle. Here I suggest the possibility that same-sex sexual behavior arises as a consequence of the competition between an evolutionary drive for a wide diversity in traits, which improves the adaptability of a species, and a drive for sexual dichotomization of traits, which promotes opposite-sex attraction and increases the rate of reproduction. A simple analytical ""toy model"" is proposed for describing this tradeoff. The model exhibits a number of interesting features, and suggests a simple mathematical form for describing the sexual orientation continuum."
D1-445	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a pivotal process. This intricate dance of nucleotides unfolds in three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. During initiation, the replication fork forms as helicases unwind the double helix. The elongation phase commences, with polymerases adding complementary nucleotides to the growing strands, continuously unwinding the DNA. Termination occurs when the replication forks meet or encounter a blocking feature, signaling the completion of one round of replication. This cyclic process ensures the faithful copying of genetic information, underpinning the continuity of life across cell divisions.
D1-446	Population expansions trigger many biomedical and ecological transitions, from tumor growth to invasions of non-native species. Although population spreading often selects for more invasive phenotypes, we show that this outcome is far from inevitable. In cooperative populations, mutations reducing dispersal have a competitive advantage. Such mutations then steadily accumulate at the expansion front bringing invasion to a halt.

Theoretical studies have assumed a single binding site for the repressor, while in most species it is found that multiple binding sites are arranged in clusters. We study a stochastic description of negative autoregulation with multiple binding sites for the repressor. We find that increasing the number of binding sites induces regular bursting of gene products.

To overcome this issue, we developed a spectrometer composed of a two VIPA stages and a multi-pass Fabry-Perot interferometer. The Fabry-Perot etalon acts as an ultra-narrow band-pass filter for Brillouin light with high spectral extinction and low loss. We report background-free Brillouin spectra from Intralipid solutions and up to 100 microns deep within chicken muscle tissue.

The relative importance of each mechanism in controlling organelle dynamics remains controversial, in particular for transport through the Golgi apparatus. Using a stochastic model, we show that full maturation of membrane-bound compartments can be seen as the stochastic escape from a steady-state in which export is dominated by vesicular exchange. We show that full maturation can contribute a significant fraction of the total out-flux for small organelles such as endosomes and Golgi cisternae.

The response of EGOS makes it suitable to be interfaced with neurons: short-term plasticity is observed at spike voltage as low as 50 mV (in a par with the amplitude of action potential in neurons) and with a typical response time in the range of tens milliseconds. Human neuroblastoma stem cells are adhered and differentiated into neurons on top of EGOS. We observe that the presence of the cells does not alter short-term plasticity of the device.

Here we present a mesoscopic model for double stranded DNA (dsDNA) at the single nucleotide level which retains the characteristic helical structure, while being able to simulate large molecules -- up to a million base pairs -- for time-scales which are relevant to physiological processes. This is made possible by an efficient and highly-parallelised implementation of the model which we discuss here. We compare the behaviour of our model with single molecule experiments where dsDNA is manipulated by external forces or torques. We also present some results on the kinetics of denaturation of linear DNA.
D1-487	 In the realm of molecular biology, the genetic code, a complex sequence of nucleotides, serves as the blueprint for protein synthesis. This code, stored within DNA, is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) during transcription. Subsequently, the mRNA migrates to the ribosome, a protein-synthesizing machinery, where it interprets the sequence to assemble amino acids into proteins. The decoding process is facilitated by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which recognize specific codons on mRNA and bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. This intricate dance of molecules ultimately leads to the creation of a vast array of proteins, each with unique functions essential for life.
D1-488	"Empirical observations in marine ecosystems have suggested a balance of biological and advection time scales as a possible explanation of species coexistence. To characterise this scenario, we measure the time to fixation in neutrally evolving populations in chaotic flows. Contrary to intuition the variation of time scales does not interpolate straightforwardly between the no-flow and well-mixed limits. instead we find that fixation is the slowest at intermediate Damk\""ohler numbers, indicating long-lasting coexistence of species. Our analysis shows that this slowdown is due to spatial organisation on an increasingly modularised network. We also find that diffusion can either slow down or speed up fixation, depending on the relative time scales of flow and evolution."

The light serves as a beacon in the pitch-black ocean depths, ensuring the anglerfish's survival in its eerie, alien environment.
D1-490	Standard neutral population genetics theory with a strictly fixed population size has important limitations. An alternative model that allows independently fluctuating population sizes and reproduces the standard neutral evolution is reviewed. We then study a situation such that the competing species are neutral at the equilibrium population size but population size fluctuations nevertheless favor fixation of one species over the other. In this case, a separation of timescales emerges naturally and allows adiabatic elimination of a fast population size variable to deduce the fluctuations-induced selection dynamics near the equilibrium population size. The results highlight the incompleteness of the standard population genetics with a strictly fixed population size.
D1-491	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating study revolves around epigenetics. This field explores changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence itself. Instead, it focuses on modifications like methylation and histone tail alterations that influence gene activity. These changes can be influenced by various factors, such as age, environment, and behavior, making epigenetics a bridge between nature and nurture. This dynamic interplay of genetic and environmental factors offers new insights into complex traits and diseases, providing fertile ground for potential treatments that consider the whole organism, rather than just its genes.
D1-492	Humans face the task of balancing dynamic systems near an unstable equilibrium repeatedly throughout their lives. Much research has been aimed at understanding the mechanisms of intermittent control in the context of human balance control. The present paper deals with one of the recent developments in the theory of human intermittent control, namely, the double-well model of noise-driven control activation. We demonstrate that the double-well model can reproduce the whole range of experimentally observed distributions under different conditions.

Transcription, the process by which genes are copied, and translation, where the copied RNA directs the assembly of amino acids, are the two key steps in this dance. Genetic mutations, alterations in DNA sequences, can disrupt this dance, leading to a myriad of diseases and disorders, highlighting the delicate balance and importance of genetics in life's grand symphony.
D1-498	The response properties of excitable systems driven by colored noise are of great interest, but are usually mathematically only accessible via approximations. For this reason, dichotomous noise, a rare example of a colored noise leading often to analytically tractable problems, has been extensively used in the study of stochastic systems. Here, we calculate exact expressions for the power spectrum and the susceptibility of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron driven by asymmetric dichotomous noise. While our results are in excellent agreement with simulations, they also highlight a limitation of using dichotomous noise as a simple model for more complex fluctuations: Both power spectrum and susceptibility exhibit an undamped periodic structure, the origin of which we discuss in detail.

This technology has the potential to eradicate genetic diseases, improve crop yields, and even enhance human traits, albeit with ethical implications. Beyond its medical and agricultural applications, CRISPR-Cas9 illuminates our understanding of bacterial immune systems, deepening our connection with the very building blocks of life. As we delve deeper into its vast possibilities, a future reshaped by genetic engineering seems increasingly within reach.
D1-504	We present a novel illumination control technique for optical diffraction tomography (ODT). Various spatial frequencies of beam illumination were controlled by displaying time-averaged sinusoidal patterns using a digital micromirror device (DMD). Compared to the previous method using binary Lee holograms, the present method eliminates unwanted diffracted beams which may deteriorate the image quality of the ODT. We demonstrated the capability of the present method by reconstructing three-dimensional refractive index (RI) distributions of various samples, with high RI sensitivity (\sigma_\Delta n = 3.15 +/- 10-4), and reconstructing 3-D RI tomograms of biological samples, which provided quantitative biochemical and morphological information about the samples.
D1-505	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized the scientific community. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacterial immune systems, enables precise editing of DNA sequences. By harnessing the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA, researchers can correct genetic mutations, insert new genes, or even silence specific genes within an organism's genome. This breakthrough technology promises a future where genetic diseases could be eradicated, crops could be engineered for enhanced resistance, and even humans could be genetically modified. However, ethical concerns persist, necessitating careful consideration and regulation to ensure the responsible use of this powerful genetic scissors.
D1-506	Transparent tissue scaffolds enable illumination of growing tissue to accelerate cell proliferation and improve other cell functions through photobiomodulation. The biphasic dose response of cells exposed to photobiomodulating light dictates that the illumination to be evenly distributed across the scaffold such that the cells are neither under nor over exposed to light. However, equalized illumination has not been sufficiently addressed. Here we analyze and experimentally demonstrate spatially equalizing illumination by three methods, namely, engineered surface scattering, reflection by a gold mirror, and traveling-waves in a ring mesh. Our results show that nearly equalized illumination is achievable by controlling the light scattering-to-loss ratio. This demonstration opens opportunities for dose-optimized photobiomodulation in tissue regeneration.
D1-507	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene editing. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacterial immune defenses, allows precise modifications of DNA sequences within an organism's genome. By harnessing the natural defense mechanism of certain bacteria against invading viruses, scientists can now correct genetic mutations, alter trait expressions, and even eradicate diseases at their roots. This groundbreaking technology has opened doors to endless possibilities, from curing genetic disorders to improving crop yields and even enhancing animal welfare. The future of medicine and biology promises to be significantly advanced, as we continue to unlock the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 and its applications.
D1-508	Combinatorial analysis of a certain abstract of RNA structures has been studied to investigate their statistics. Our approach regards the backbone of secondary structures as an alternate sequence of paired and unpaired sets of nucleotides, which can be described by random matrix model. We obtain the generating function of the structures using Hermitian matrix model with Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind and analyze the statistics with respect to the number of stems. To match the experimental findings of the statistical behavior, we consider the structures in a grand canonical ensemble and find a fugacity value corresponding to an appropriate number of stems.
D1-509	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can significantly influence organismal traits. These genetic variations, occurring when a DNA sequence differs between individuals at the same location, play pivotal roles in determining everything from eye color to susceptibility to diseases. For instance, a specific SNP in the human genome is linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, highlighting the vital connection between our genes and health. As research progresses, understanding and leveraging these SNPs can potentially lead to personalized medicine, revolutionizing healthcare by addressing each individual's unique genetic makeup.
D1-510	Despite the obvious advantage of simple life forms capable of fast replication, different levels of cognitive complexity have been achieved by living systems in terms of their potential to cope with environmental uncertainty. Against the inevitable cost associated to detecting environmental cues and responding to them in adaptive ways, we conjecture that the potential for predicting the environment can overcome the expenses associated to maintaining costly, complex structures. We present a minimal formal model grounded in information theory and selection, in which successive generations of agents are mapped into transmitters and receivers of a coded message. Our agents are guessing machines and their capacity to deal with environments of different complexity defines the conditions to sustain more complex agents.
D1-511	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication is a captivating process. It's akin to photocopying the blueprint of life, ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information from parent cells to daughter cells during cell division. This process involves enzymes, such as helicases, primases, and polymerases, working in harmony to unwind the double helix, synthesize RNA primers, and extend these primers into new strands of DNA. This meticulous dance of proteins results in identical copies of the DNA molecule, preserving the integrity of the genetic code and enabling the continuation of life.
D1-512	This paper presents a monotonicity-based spatiotemporal conductivity imaging method for continuous regional lung monitoring using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The EIT data (i.e., the boundary current-voltage data) can be decomposed into pulmonary, cardiac and other parts using their different periodic natures. The time-differential current-voltage operator corresponding to the lung ventilation can be viewed as either semi-positive or semi-negative definite owing to monotonic conductivity changes within the lung regions. We used this monotonicity constraints to improve the quality of lung EIT imaging. We tested the proposed methods in numerical simulations, phantom experiments and human experiments.
D1-513	 In the intricate world of biology, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This life-sustaining chemical reaction, primarily carried out by green plants and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that's stored in carbohydrate molecules. The equation, while simplified, beautifully encapsulates this transformation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2. This process not only feeds the plants but also oxygenates our atmosphere, making it a cornerstone of life on Earth.
D1-514	This paper investigates cells proliferation dynamics in small tumor cell aggregates using an individual based model (IBM). The simulation model is designed to study the morphology of the cell population and of the cell lineages as well as the impact of the orientation of the division plane on this morphology. Our IBM model is based on the hypothesis that cells are incompressible objects that grow in size and divide once a threshold size is reached, and that newly born cell adhere to the existing cell cluster. We performed comparisons between the simulation model and experimental data by using several statistical indicators. The results suggest that the emergence of particular morphologies can be explained by simple mechanical interactions.
D1-515	 Stepping into the realm of genetics, we find the intriguing world of DNA barcoding, a modern tool for species identification. By analyzing short, standardized DNA sequences, this method allows scientists to distinguish between closely related species, even those that share similar appearances. This rapid and cost-effective approach is revolutionizing fields such as biodiversity research, food authentication, and conservation efforts. It helps us understand the complex web of life on Earth, safeguard food security, and protect endangered species, all while fostering our ongoing quest for knowledge in the fascinating realm of biology.
D1-516	Ultrasound-modulated optical tomography (UOT) is a technique that images optical contrast deep inside scattering media. Heterodyne holography is a promising tool able to detect the UOT tagged photons with high efficiency. In this work, we describe theoretically the detection of the tagged photon in heterodyne holography based UOT, show how to filter the untagged photon, and discuss the effect of shot noise. The discussion considers also speckle decorrelation. We show that optimal detection sensitivity can be reached, if the frame exposure time of the camera used to perform the holographic detection is of the order of the decorrelation time.
D1-517	 In marine biology, coral reefs are intricate ecosystems teeming with life, often referred to as the 'rainforests of the sea'. They support a vast array of species, from tiny plankton to colossal whale sharks. Corals, the foundation of these marvels, are actually tiny animals, not plants, forming colonies that build the reefs. However, coral bleaching poses a significant threat, a phenomenon caused by warmer ocean temperatures that cause corals to expel the algae living in their tissues, leading to reef deterioration and loss of biodiversity. This issue not only impacts marine life but also disrupts coastal communities that rely on reefs for food, tourism, and protection against storms. Urgent action is needed to mitigate climate change, reduce pollution, and promote sustainable practices to preserve these vital underwater wonders.
D1-518	We map a class of well-mixed stochastic models of biochemical feedback in steady state to the mean-field Ising model near the critical point. The mapping provides an effective temperature, magnetic field, order parameter, and heat capacity that can be extracted from biological data without fitting or knowledge of the underlying molecular details. We demonstrate this procedure on fluorescence data from mouse T cells, which reveals distinctions between how the cells respond to different drugs. We also show that the heat capacity allows inference of absolute molecule number from fluorescence intensity. We explain this result in terms of the underlying fluctuations and demonstrate the generality of our work.
D1-519	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can exert significant influence. These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring at specific positions, serve as genetic markers, offering insights into an organism's genetic makeup. SNPs, when studied in groups, can reveal patterns, helping researchers trace ancestry, understand disease susceptibility, and even predict responses to certain drugs. These genetic 'fingerprints' are thus indispensable tools in modern biology and medicine, bridging the gap between our understanding of genetics and its practical applications.
D1-520	By means of a recently-proposed metric or structural derivative, called scale-q-derivative approach, we formulate differential equation that models the cell death by a radiation exposure in tumor treatments. The considered independent variable here is the absorbed radiation dose D instead of usual time. The survival factor, Fs, for radiation damaged cell obtained here is in agreement with the literature on the maximum entropy principle, as it was recently shown and also exhibits an excellent agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the well-known linear and quadratic models are obtained. With this approach, we give a step forward and suggest other expressions for survival factors that are dependent on the complex tumor structure.
D1-521	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a cornerstone process, sustaining virtually all organisms on Earth. This biochemical marvel occurs within plant, algal, and some bacterial cells, converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll, the green pigment, plays a pivotal role, absorbing light energy, which then triggers a series of reactions, culminating in the synthesis of glucose and the release of oxygen. This remarkable process not only fuels the growth of plants but also oxygenates our atmosphere, making Earth hospitable for aerobic life forms. Photosynthesis, a testament to nature's ingenuity, is a symphony of chemistry and energy that underpins the very web of life on our planet.
D1-522	At present, multi-electrode array (MEA) approach and optical recording allow us to acquire plant electrical activity with higher spatio-temporal resolution. To understand the dynamic information flow of the electrical signaling system and estimate the effective connectivity, we proposed a solution to combine the two casualty analysis approaches, i.e. Granger causality and transfer entropy, which they complement each other to measure dynamics effective connectivity of the complex system. Our findings in three qualitatively different levels of plant bioelectrical activities revealed direction of information flow and dynamic complex causal connectives by using the two causal analysis approaches, especially indicated that the direction of information flow is not only along the longitudinal section but also spreading in transection.
D1-523	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, bridging the realms of biology and chemistry. This natural phenomenon, carried out by plants and some microorganisms, transforms sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This conversion of light energy into chemical energy is crucial for sustaining life on Earth, providing the primary food source for most organisms and maintaining the planet's oxygen levels. The efficiency of photosynthesis is a delicate balance, impacted by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration. Its significance extends beyond basic survival, with ongoing research exploring its potential in developing sustainable energy solutions.
D1-524	"The correct prediction of protein secondary structures is one of the key issues in predicting the correct protein folded shape, which is used for determining gene function. Existing methods make use of amino acids properties as indices to classify protein secondary structures, but are faced with a significant number of misclassifications. The paper presents a technique for the classification of protein secondary structures based on protein ""signal-plotting"" and the use of the Fourier technique for digital signal processing. New indices are proposed to classify protein secondary structures by analyzing hydrophobicity profiles. The approach is simple and straightforward. Results show that the more types of protein secondary structures can be classified by means of these newly-proposed indices."
D1-525	 In the realm of genetics, the DNA double helix stands as the bedrock of life, carrying the blueprint of every living organism. This intricate molecule, composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - is arranged in a specific sequence, akin to a unique biological fingerprint. This sequence determines the traits and characteristics of an organism, from eye color to complex behaviors. The DNA's incredible information storage capacity, coupled with the mechanisms of replication and transcription, ensures consistency across generations and the continuity of life on Earth. This remarkable molecule, though tiny, encapsulates the grand complexity of life itself.
D1-526	Life science is entering a new era of petabyte-level sequencing data. Converting such big data to biological insights represents a huge challenge for computational analysis. To this end, we developed DeepMetabolism, a biology-guided deep learning system to predict cell phenotypes from transcriptomics data. By integrating unsupervised pre-training with supervised training, DeepMetabolism is able to predict phenotypes with high accuracy (PCC>0.92), high speed (<30 min for >100 GB data using a single GPU), and high robustness (tolerate up to 75% noise). We envision DeepMetabolism to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype and to serve as a springboard for applications in synthetic biology and precision medicine.
D1-527	 In the intricate realm of genomics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands as a revolutionary breakthrough. This tool, derived from bacterial immunity, enables precise editing of DNA sequences. By harnessing this technology, scientists can correct genetic mutations, introduce new traits, and unravel the mysteries of hereditary diseases. The potential applications extend beyond medical research, promising a future where crops can be engineered for increased yield and resilience, contributing to global food security. Despite ethical debates and regulatory challenges, the CRISPR-Cas9 system underscores the power of biology to reshape our world.
D1-528	The internal deformation of the brain is far more complex than the rigid motion of the skull. An ultrasound imaging technique that we have developed has a combination of penetration, frame-rate, and motion detection accuracy required to directly observe, for the first time, the formation and evolution of shear shock waves in the brain. Experiments at low impacts on the traumatic brain injury scale demonstrate that they are spontaneously generated and propagate within the porcine brain. Compared to the initially smooth impact, the acceleration at the shock front is amplified up to a factor of 8.5. This highly localized increase in acceleration suggests that shear shock waves are a fundamental mechanism for traumatic injuries in soft tissue.
D1-529	 In the realm of microbiology, bacteriophages, or phages, are fascinating entities. These are viruses that exclusively infect bacteria, offering a unique solution in combatting antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Phages are remarkably diverse, with thousands of distinct types, each targeting specific bacterial hosts. They inject their genetic material into the bacteria, effectively hijacking it to replicate. Post-replication, they burst the bacterial cell, releasing new phages to infect more bacteria, thus controlling bacterial populations. This natural, targeted approach could potentially revolutionize modern medicine, providing a viable alternative to antibiotics in the face of increasing antibiotic resistance.
D1-530	We analyse the unfolding pathway of biomolecules comprising several independent modules in pulling experiments. In a recently proposed model, a critical velocity $v_{c}$ has been predicted, such that for pulling speeds $v>v_{c}$ it is the module at the pulled end that opens first, whereas for $v<v_{c}$ it is the weakest. Here, we introduce a variant of the model that is closer to the experimental setup, and discuss the robustness of the emergence of the critical velocity and of its dependence on the model parameters. We also propose a possible experiment to test the theoretical predictions of the model, which seems feasible with state-of-art molecular engineering techniques.
D1-531	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) serves as the blueprint for life, encoding the genetic instructions for an organism's development, growth, and function. Each DNA molecule is a double helix, composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases pair through hydrogen bonds, with adenine pairing with thymine and guanine pairing with cytosine. The sequence of these bases, arranged in a specific order along the DNA molecule, forms the genetic code essential for protein synthesis and the expression of hereditary traits. This intricate system of genetic information transfer and expression is a cornerstone of life on Earth, governing the remarkable diversity and adaptability of living organisms.
D1-532	The goal of the Human Brain Project is to develop during the next decade an infrastructure necessary for running a simulation of the entire human brain constrained by current experimental data. One of the key issues is therefore to integrate and make accessible the experimental data necessary to constrain and fully specify this model. The required data covers many different spatial scales, ranging from the molecular scale to the whole brain and these data are obtained using a variety of techniques whose measurements may not be directly comparable. Furthermore, these data are incomplete, and will remain so at least for the coming decade. Here we review new neuroinformatics techniques that need to be developed and applied to address these issues.
D1-533	 In the intricate realm of molecular biology, the DNA double helix serves as the blueprint of life. Composed of nucleotides bonded together in a specific sequence, this genetic material carries the coded instructions essential for an organism's growth and development. DNA replication, the process by which this information is copied, ensures the faithful transmission of genetic data from parent to offspring, perpetuating the diverse tapestry of life. This remarkable biomolecule, with its double helix structure, serves as a testament to nature's ingenious design and the fundamental unit of heredity.
D1-534	Signal transduction networks can form highly interconnected systems within cells due to network crosstalk, the sharing of input signals between multiple downstream responses. To better understand the evolutionary design principles underlying such networks, we study the evolution of crosstalk and the emergence of specificity for two parallel signaling pathways that arise via gene duplication and are subsequently allowed to diverge. We focus on a sequence based evolutionary algorithm and evolve the network based on two physically motivated fitness functions related to information transmission. Surprisingly, we find that the two fitness functions lead to very different evolutionary outcomes, one with a high degree of crosstalk and the other without.
D1-535	 In marine ecosystems, the kelp forest serves as a vital, intricate web of life. This underwater forest, composed of giant kelp, creates an essential habitat for a myriad of species. The kelp's holdfast anchors it to the ocean floor, while its long, ribbon-like stipes reach towards the surface, providing shelter and food for numerous organisms. Schools of fish dart beneath the fronds, seeking protection from predators, while crustaceans scuttle along the kelp's stipes. Seabirds and mammals, like sea otters, also rely on the kelp forest for sustenance. The kelp itself absorbs nutrients from the water, promoting the health of the entire ecosystem. The kelp forest's demise would have cascading effects, disrupting the delicate balance of the marine environment.
D1-536	We present an analytical framework that allows the quantitative study of statistical dynamic properties of networks with adaptive nodes that have memory and is used to examine the emergence of oscillations in networks with response failures. The frequency of the oscillations was quantitatively found to increase with the excitability of the nodes and with the average degree of the network and to decrease with delays between nodes. For networks of networks, diverse cluster oscillation modes were found as a function of the topology. Analytical results are in agreement with large-scale simulations and open the horizon for understanding network dynamics composed of finite memory nodes as well as their different phases of activity.
D1-537	 Delving into the intricate realm of genetics, we find ourselves at the heart of DNA replication, the process that allows for the faithful copying of our genetic blueprint. This remarkable feat unfolds within the nucleus of a cell, where the double helix unwinds, and each strand serves as a template for a new one. Enzymes, such as helicase and polymerase, orchestrate this dance of molecules, ensuring the precise pairing of nucleotides. Once copies are complete, the cell divides, passing on identical genetic information to its offspring, thus maintaining continuity and consistency in the genetic makeup of life.
D1-538	"The artificial axon is an excitable node built with the basic biomolecular components and supporting action potentials. Here we demonstrate coincidence firing (the AND operation) and other basic electrophysiology features such as increasing firing rates for increasing input currents. We construct the basic unit for a network by connecting two such excitable nodes through an electronic synapse, producing pre/post synaptic behavior in which one axon induces firing in another. We show that the system is well described by the Hodgkin-Huxley model of nerve excitability, and conclude with a brief outlook for realizing large networks of such low voltage ""ionics""."
D1-539	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can subtly alter an organism's genetic makeup. These minute variations, occurring approximately every 100-300 bases in the human genome, can influence traits such as eye color, susceptibility to diseases, or response to medication. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, provided a blueprint of the human genome, paving the way for various applications in medicine, anthropology, and forensics. SNPs, being the most common type of genetic variation in humans, are fundamental in understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases, offering promising avenues for personalized medicine and potential therapeutic interventions.
D1-540	In the past two decades, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging has been used to relate neuronal network activity to cognitive processing and behaviour. Recently this approach has been augmented by algorithms that allow us to infer causal links between component populations of neuronal networks. Multiple inference procedures have been proposed to approach this research question but so far, each method has limitations when it comes to establishing whole-brain connectivity patterns. In this work, we discuss eight ways to infer causality in fMRI research: Bayesian Nets, Dynamical Causal Modelling, Granger Causality, Likelihood Ratios, LiNGAM, Patel's Tau, Structural Equation Modelling, and Transfer Entropy. We finish with formulating some recommendations for the future directions in this area.
D1-541	 In the intricate realm of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can hold vast influence. SNPs are minor variations in DNA sequence, occurring when a single nucleotide differs between individuals. These seemingly insignificant changes can significantly impact an organism's traits, predisposition to diseases, or response to drugs. For instance, the SNP associated with lactose intolerance in humans has evolved among different populations due to changes in dietary practices. Similarly, SNPs in the BRCA1 gene increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women. By understanding these SNPs, we can gain critical insights into human evolution, disease susceptibility, and drug response, ultimately paving the way for more personalized and effective healthcare.
D1-542	We estimate treatment cost-savings from early cancer diagnosis. For breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancers and melanoma, which account for more than 50% of new incidences projected in 2017, we combine published cancer treatment cost estimates by stage with incidence rates by stage at diagnosis. We extrapolate to other cancer sites by using estimated national expenditures and incidence rates. A rough estimate for the U.S. national annual treatment cost-savings from early cancer diagnosis is in 11 digits. Using this estimate and cost-neutrality, we also estimate a rough upper bound on the cost of a routine early cancer screening test.
D1-543	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a fascinating extension. Unlike DNA sequence alterations, epigenetic changes do not involve modifications to the base pairs themselves. Instead, they are chemical tags attached to DNA or histone proteins, altering gene expression patterns. These tags can be influenced by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state. Epigenetic changes play crucial roles in processes like development, aging, and disease susceptibility. For instance, they contribute to cancer progression by activating oncogenes and silencing tumor suppressor genes. As our understanding of epigenetics deepens, so too does the potential for targeted therapies that can modify these tags to prevent or treat diseases.
D1-544	Recent studies have proposed that the diffusion of messenger molecules, such as monoamines, can mediate the plastic adaptation of synapses in supervised learning of neural networks. Based on these findings we developed a model for neural learning, where the signal for plastic adaptation is assumed to propagate through the extracellular space. We investigate the conditions allowing learning of Boolean rules in a neural network. Even fully excitatory networks show very good learning performances. Moreover, the investigation of the plastic adaptation features optimizing the performance suggests that learning is very sensitive to the extent of the plastic adaptation and the spatial range of synaptic connections.
D1-545	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can exert significant influence. These minute variations in DNA sequence, occurring frequently among populations, can subtly alter protein structure and functionality, affecting traits such as disease susceptibility, drug response, and even physical characteristics. SNPs, when studied collectively in large cohorts, provide indispensable insights into genetic inheritance patterns and human evolution, offering promising avenues for personalized medicine and targeted therapies.
D1-546	We consider the task of detecting regulatory elements in the human genome directly from raw DNA. Past work has focused on small snippets of DNA, making it difficult to model long-distance dependencies that arise from DNA's 3-dimensional conformation. In order to study long-distance dependencies, we develop and release a novel dataset for a larger-context modeling task. Using this new data set we model long-distance interactions using dilated convolutional neural networks, and compare them to standard convolutions and recurrent neural networks. We show that dilated convolutions are effective at modeling the locations of regulatory markers in the human genome, such as transcription factor binding sites, histone modifications, and DNAse hypersensitivity sites.
D1-547	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized the field by offering a precise, cost-effective, and accessible method for gene editing. Originally discovered in bacteria as an immune defense mechanism against viruses, this system has been harnessed to modify DNA sequences in virtually any organism, from humans to plants. By introducing a guide RNA that targets a specific gene, the Cas9 enzyme creates a double-strand break, allowing for the replacement or repair of the faulty gene. This groundbreaking technology has immense potential to combat genetic diseases, develop more resilient crops, and further our understanding of biological systems. Yet, while the possibilities are vast, ethical considerations, such as potential misuse and unintended consequences, demand careful deliberation as we navigate the exciting frontier of genetic engineering.
D1-548	Membrane protein transporters alternate their substrate-binding sites between the extracellular and cytosolic side of the membrane according to the alternating access mechanism. Inspired by this intriguing mechanism devised by nature, we study particle transport through a channel coupled with an energy well that oscillates its position between the two entrances of the channel. We optimize particle transport across the channel by adjusting the oscillation frequency. At the optimal oscillation frequency, the translocation rate through the channel is a hundred times higher with respect to free diffusion across the channel. Our findings reveal the effect of time dependent potentials on particle transport across a channel and will be relevant for membrane transport and microfluidics application.
D1-549	 In marine biology, the ocean's depths harbor a myriad of life forms, many yet undiscovered. The Bathypelagic zone, at 1000-4000 meters deep, is characterized by perpetual darkness and immense pressure. Here reside bioluminescent creatures, such as the Flashlight Fish, which use their light-producing organs to communicate, attract prey, or confuse predators. The Giant Squid, a legendary entity, has been confirmed to inhabit these depths, while the Vampire Squid's ability to survive in the cold, acidic, and low-oxygen conditions is nothing short of remarkable. These deep-sea dwellers adapt through unique features, like the transparent bodies of some fish, reducing their silhouette against the lightless backdrop, or a biochemical trick, as is the case with the Antarctic icefish, which has evolved a blood-free heart to survive in the extreme cold. The ocean's abyssal realms are a testament to life's resilience and adaptability in the most challenging environments.
D1-550	Effective intervention strategies for epidemics rely on the identification of their origin and on the robustness of the predictions made by network disease models. We introduce a Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework to infer model parameters for a disease spreading on a network of communities from limited, noisy observations. the state-of-the-art computational framework compensates for the model complexity by exploiting massively parallel computing architectures. Using noisy, synthetic data, we show the potential of the approach to perform robust model fitting and additionally demonstrate that we can effectively identify the disease origin via Bayesian model selection. As disease-related data are increasingly available, the proposed framework has broad practical relevance for the prediction and management of epidemics.
D1-551	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized molecular biology, offering a precise, efficient, and cost-effective method for editing DNA sequences. This groundbreaking tool, discovered within bacteria as an immune defense mechanism against viruses, now serves as a powerful research and therapeutic instrument. By introducing precise modifications to genetic code, scientists can modify organisms, correct genetic mutations, and even prevent the spread of genetic diseases. The potential applications extend beyond human medicine, with agriculture, ecology, and industrial biotechnology poised to benefit significantly from this transformative technology. As the understanding and refinement of CRISPR-Cas9 continue to advance, the implications for humanity are vast, promising to reshape our understanding of genetics and revolutionize life sciences.
D1-552	The first of $N$ identical independently distributed (i.i.d.) Brownian trajectories that arrives to a small target, sets the time scale of activation, which in general is much faster than the arrival to the target of only a single trajectory. Analytical asymptotic expressions for the minimal time is notoriously difficult to compute in general geometries. We derive here asymptotic laws for the probability density function of the first and second arrival times of a large number of i.i.d. Brownian trajectories to a small target in 1,2, and 3 dimensions and study their range of validity by stochastic simulations. The results are applied to activation of biochemical pathways in cellular transduction.
D1-553	 In the complex tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the life-sustaining dance between plants and sunlight. Chlorophyll, the green pigment within plant cells, acts as a solar panel, absorbing light energy and converting it into chemical energy through a series of intricate reactions. Carbon dioxide, drawn from the atmosphere, is transformed into glucose, a simple sugar, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This remarkable process fuels the growth of plants, serves as the primary source of food for most organisms, and regulates the Earth's oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, thus underpinning the very foundation of life on our planet.
D1-554	A numerical simulation infrastructure capable of calculating the flow of gas and the trajectories of particles through an aerodynamic lens injector is presented. The simulations increase the fundamental understanding and predict optimized injection geometries and parameters. Our simulation results were compared to previous reports and also validated against experimental data for 500 nm polystyrene spheres from an aerosol-beam- characterization setup. The simulations yielded a detailed understanding of the radial phase-space distribution and highlighted weaknesses of current aerosol injectors for single-particle diffractive imaging. With the aid of these simulations we developed new experimental implementations to overcome current limitations.
D1-555	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, performed by green plants and some microorganisms, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, transformed into glucose and oxygen in a testament to nature's efficiency. This oxygen, a byproduct of photosynthesis, is vital for most life forms, as it serves as a key component in cellular respiration, enabling organisms to extract energy from food. Photosynthesis, a symphony of sunlight, carbon, and water, underpins the survival and growth of life on Earth.
D1-556	Receptor-induced apoptosis is a complex signal transduction pathway involving numerous protein/protein interactions and post-transcriptional modifications. The response to death receptor stimulation varies significantly from one cell line to another and even from one cell to another within a given cell line. In this context, it is often difficult to assess whether the molecular mechanisms identified so far are sufficient to explain the rich quantitative observations now available, and to detect possible gaps in our understanding. This is precisely where computational systems biology approaches may contribute. In this chapter, we review studies done in this direction, focusing on those that provided significant insight on the functioning of this complex pathway by tightly integrating experimental and computational approaches.
D1-557	 In the realm of ecology, symbiosis, a close and often long-term biological interaction between different species, plays a crucial role. One such example is the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae algae. These tiny algae live within the coral's tissues, providing the host with essential nutrients through photosynthesis, while the coral offers the algae a safe haven and access to dissolved nutrients. This mutually beneficial partnership is crucial for the survival of coral reefs, offering a vibrant, diverse, and productive ecosystem that supports a myriad of marine life. However, changes in temperature and light can disrupt this delicate balance, leading to coral bleaching, a dire threat to the health of our oceans and the species that depend on these vital ecosystems.
D1-558	We report an acoustic approach to measure the elastic properties of an extracellular matrix (ECM). This approach uses a short range evanescent waves to inject sound into the test material over a short distance using an electroded quartz crystal, also known as a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). These measurements are applied with a press-to-contact approach to determine the elastic properties reliably and rapidly. The elasticity of ECM is connected to material chemistry which is linked to the tissue type and history. Measuring the minimum relative amplitude of the signal from the QCM shows that the acoustic response is strongly correlated to tissue type and age.
D1-559	 In the intricate web of life, the humble honeybee stands as a vital player. As pollinators, they transfer pollen between flowers, aiding in the fertilization process essential for fruit and seed production. Their role is crucial in agriculture, contributing to over a third of the world's food production. Yet, these tireless workers face numerous threats, including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and climate change. Consequently, their numbers have been declining, raising concerns about food security and ecosystem balance. Efforts to protect these vital creatures include creating bee-friendly habitats, regulating pesticide use, and researching bee diseases. Maintaining healthy bee populations is more than just saving a species. it's about safeguarding our food supply and preserving the delicate balance of our ecosystems.
D1-560	Gene regulatory networks are powerful abstractions of biological systems. Since the advent of high-throughput measurement technologies in biology in the late 90s, reconstructing the structure of such networks has been a central computational problem in systems biology. While the problem is certainly not solved in its entirety, considerable progress has been made in the last two decades, with mature tools now available. This chapter aims to provide an introduction to the basic concepts underpinning network inference tools, attempting a categorisation which highlights commonalities and relative strengths. While the chapter is meant to be self-contained, the material presented should provide a useful background to the later, more specialised chapters of this book.
D1-561	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single base pair mutation in DNA can lead to profound changes. The classic example is sickle cell anemia, caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene. This alteration results in the production of an abnormal hemoglobin variant, causing red blood cells to assume a sickle shape. These distorted cells are less flexible, leading to blockage in small blood vessels, reduced oxygen delivery, and the symptoms of this debilitating disease. Yet, it's important to note that this mutation also provides some resistance to malaria, demonstrating the complex interplay between genetics, disease, and evolution.
D1-562	Multiple scales in metapopulations can give rise to paradoxical behaviour: in a conceptual model for a public goods game, the species associated with a fitness cost due to the public good production can be stabilised in the well-mixed limit due to the mere existence of these scales. The scales in this model involve a length scale corresponding to separate patches, coupled by mobility, and separate time scales for reproduction and interaction with a local environment. Contrary to the well-mixed high mobility limit, we find that for low mobilities, the interaction rate progressively stabilises this species due to stochastic effects, and that the formation of spatial patterns is not crucial for this stabilisation.
D1-563	 In plant biology, photosynthesis is a fundamental process that sustains life on Earth. This biochemical reaction, primarily carried out by chloroplasts within plant cells, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosystems I and II, key components of the photosynthetic apparatus, use the energy from sunlight to drive this process, harnessing electrons from water to power the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. Subsequently, these energy-rich molecules are utilized in the Calvin cycle, where carbon dioxide is fixed into glucose, a vital energy source for plants and the foundation of our global food chain. Photosynthesis's unparalleled significance allows for the expansion of terrestrial ecosystems, supporting the growth of diverse flora and maintaining the planet's oxygen levels, a testament to its irreplaceable role in maintaining Earth's delicate balance.
D1-564	The availability of protein is an important factor for the determination of the size of the mitotic spindle. Involved in spindle-size regulation is kinesin-8, a molecular motor and microtubule (MT) depolymerase, which is known to tightly control MT length. Here, we propose and analyze a theoretical model in which kinesin-induced MT depolymerization competes with spontaneous polymerization while supplies of both tubulin and kinesin are limited. In contrast to previous studies where resources were unconstrained, we find that, for a wide range of concentrations, MT length regulation is bistable. We test our predictions by conducting in vitro experiments, and find that the bistable behavior manifests in a bimodal MT length distribution.
D1-565	 In the intricate world of biology, photosynthesis stands as a remarkable symphony of life. Plants, algae, and some bacteria orchestrate this process, transforming sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This transformative dance occurs within chloroplasts, the photosynthetic factories of cells. During photophosphorylation, sunlight is harnessed to create ATP, the cells' primary energy currency. In the Calvin cycle, ATP and NADPH, another energy carrier, facilitate the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose. The byproduct, oxygen, is a vital component in our atmosphere, sustaining aerobic life forms. Photosynthesis, a testament to nature's ingenuity, underpins the entire web of life on Earth.
D1-566	The Voronoi-based cellular model is highly successful in describing the motion of two-dimensional confluent cell tissues. In the homogeneous version of this model, the energy of each cell is determined solely by its geometric shape and size, and the interaction between adjacent cells is a byproduct of this additive energy. We generalize this model so as to allow zero or partial contact between cells. We identify several phases, two of which (solid confluent and liquid confluent) were found in previous studies that imposed confluency but others that are novel. Transitions in this model may be relevant for understanding both normal development as well as cancer metastasis.
D1-567	 In the realm of genetics, DNA sequencing revolutionizes our understanding of biological diversity. This technique unveils the precise order of nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, within an organism's genome. By comparing these sequences across species, we can appreciate the intricate web of life, tracing evolutionary relationships and uncovering shared genetic heritage. Furthermore, DNA sequencing aids in diagnosing genetic disorders, monitoring the spread of diseases, and even predicting an individual's susceptibility to certain ailments. Its applications extend to ecosystem conservation, crop improvement, and biotechnology, shaping the future of medicine, agriculture, and environmental science.
D1-568	We develop a theoretical framework for understanding dynamic morphologies and stability of droplet interface bilayers (DIBs), accounting for lipid kinetics in the monolayers and bilayer, and droplet evaporation due to imbalance between osmotic and Laplace pressures. Our theory quantitatively describes distinct pathways observed in experiments when DIBs become unstable. We find that when the timescale for lipid desorption is slow compared to droplet evaporation, the lipid bilayer will grow and the droplets approach a hemispherical shape. In contrast, when lipid desorption is fast, the bilayer area will shrink and the droplets eventually detach. Our model also suggests there is a critical size below which DIBs cannot be stable, which may explain experimental difficulties in miniaturising the DIB platform.
D1-569	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant player. Epigenetics, in essence, refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications, primarily through chemical tags, can be influenced by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease states. These changes, in turn, can impact an organism's development, behavior, and susceptibility to disease, demonstrating the intricate web of interactions between our genes and the world around us. Epigenetic research opens avenues for understanding and potentially influencing health and disease on a whole new level.
D1-570	Many pressing medical challenges - such as diagnosing disease, enhancing directed stem cell differentiation, and classifying cancers - have long been hindered by limitations in our ability to quantify proteins in single cells. Mass-spectrometry (MS) is poised to transcend these limitations by developing powerful methods to routinely quantify thousands of proteins and proteoforms across many thousands of single cells. We outline specific technological developments and ideas that can increase the sensitivity and throughput of single cell MS by orders of magnitude and usher in this new age. These advances will transform medicine and ultimately contribute to understanding biological systems on an entirely new level.
D1-571	 In marine biology, the delicate balance of ecosystems is profoundly influenced by the life cycle and behavior of jellyfish. These gelatinous creatures, often misunderstood, play vital roles in nutrient cycling and energy flow within their habitats. As apex predators in food chains, they regulate population sizes of smaller organisms, while serving as a food source for larger marine life. Their unique reproduction methods, often involving both sexual and asexual means, allow for rapid population growth and recovery, adapting to environmental changes swiftly. Moreover, jellyfish blooms can indicate ecological imbalances, such as overfishing or pollution, reflecting their significance as bioindicators. Despite their seemingly ethereal appearance, jellyfish are essential components in maintaining the health and resilience of our ocean ecosystems.
D1-572	Humans interact with each other on a daily basis by developing and maintaining various social norms and it is critical to form a deeper understanding of how such norms develop, how they change, and how fast they change. In this work, we develop an evolutionary game-theoretic model based on research in cultural psychology that shows that humans in various cultures differ in their tendencies to conform with those around them. Using this model, we analyze the evolutionary relationships between the tendency to conform and how quickly a population reacts when conditions make a change in norm desirable. Our analysis identifies conditions when a tipping point is reached in a population, causing norms to change rapidly.
D1-573	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the cornerstone of the planet's oxygen cycle. This biochemical marvel, performed by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This transformation, powered by chlorophyll, is not only essential for the survival of these organisms but also for the sustenance of countless others, including humans. Photosynthesis, therefore, is an indispensable link in the delicate balance of our ecosystem, a testament to nature's ingenious design, and a beacon of hope amidst our quest for sustainable living.
D1-574	Biological networks are a very convenient modelling and visualisation tool to discover knowledge from modern high-throughput genomics and postgenomics data sets. Indeed, biological entities are not isolated, but are components of complex multi-level systems. We go one step further and advocate for the consideration of causal representations of the interactions in living systems.We present the causal formalism and bring it out in the context of biological networks, when the data is observational. We also discuss its ability to decipher the causal information flow as observed in gene expression. We also illustrate our exploration by experiments on small simulated networks as well as on a real biological data set.
D1-575	 In the captivating realm of marine biology, the bioluminescent sea creature, the anglerfish, emerges as a mesmerizing enigma. This deep-sea resident boasts a unique lure, illuminated by light-producing bacteria, which it uses to attract prey in the dark abyss. The female anglerfish, remarkably larger than the male, absorbs the male after mating, providing him sustenance in a parasitic relationship. This extraordinary adaptability and survival strategy reveal the anglerfish as a testament to evolution, thriving in one of Earth's most inhospitable environments. Its enigmatic beauty and unusual life cycle continue to intrigue scientists and enthusiasts alike.
D1-576	We investigate the linearized hydrodynamic equations of interacting self-propelled particles in two dimensional space. It is found that the small perturbations of density and polarization fields satisfy the hyperbolic partial differential equations---that admit analytical propagating wave solutions. These solutions uncover the questionable traveling band formation in the flocking state of self-propelled particles. Below the critical noise strength, an unstable disordered state (random motion) undergoes a transient vortex and evolves to an ordered state (flocking motion) as unidirectional traveling waves. There appear two possible longitudinal wave patterns depending on the noise strength, including single band in stable state and multiplebands in unstable state. A comparison of theoretical and experimental studies is presented.
D1-577	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the green pulse of our planet. This biochemical reaction, primarily carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process not only fuels the growth of these organisms but also replenishes our atmosphere with life-sustaining oxygen. Photosynthesis, in essence, is a symbiotic dance between sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, a dance that sustains the very fabric of life on Earth.
D1-578	We propose an approach to analysing single trajectories of a particle, which moves randomly on a landscape distinct parts of which result in sufficiently various diffusion coefficients. The method based on the mapping the cumulative sum of step-wise elementary displacement squared into a complex oscillating functions with the subsequent continuous wavelet analysis of the later allows the localisation of relatively homogeneous sub-regions and determining values of the diffusion coefficient within each such sub-region. This approach is applied to demonstrable test examples as well as to the reconstruction of the biological membrane's properties from the real data of single molecule walk tracing.
D1-579	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating study explores the concept of epigenetics, a layer of biological regulation that modifies gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. This intricate dance of proteins, enzymes, and chemical tags influences how genes are read and expressed, playing a significant role in our development, health, and even response to environmental factors. Epigenetic changes can be influenced by lifestyle choices, such as diet, stress levels, and physical activity, offering a promising avenue for preventive medicine and personalized treatment strategies in the future. As our understanding of this complex system deepens, so does the potential to unlock new frontiers in disease prevention and treatment.
D1-580	The artificial axon is a recently introduced synthetic assembly of supported lipid bilayers and voltage gated ion channels, displaying the basic electrophysiology of nerve cells. Here we demonstrate the use of two artificial axons as control elements to achieve a simple task. Namely, we steer a remote control car towards a light source, using the sensory input dependent firing rate of the axons as the control signal for turning left or right. We present the result in the form of the analysis of a movie of the car approaching the light source. In general terms, with this work we pursue a constructivist approach to exploring the nexus between machine language at the nerve cell level and behavior.
D1-581	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics unfolds a captivating layer of complexity. While DNA remains constant, epigenetics, the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself, offers intriguing insights. These modifications, primarily through DNA methylation and histone modification, can influence gene activity and, consequently, cellular behavior. These changes can be influenced by factors such as age, environment, and lifestyle, and are thought to play a significant role in disease development and heritability patterns that don't directly correlate with DNA sequence. Epigenetics, thus, bridges the gap between nature and nurture, shedding light on the dynamic interplay between genes and the environment that shapes life.
D1-582	A power-law distance-dependent biased random walk model with a tuning parameter ($\sigma$) is introduced in which finite mean first passage times are realizable if $\sigma$ is less than a critical value $\sigma_c$. We perform numerical simulations in $1$-dimension to obtain $\sigma_c \sim 1.14$. The three-dimensional version of this model is related to the phenomenon of chemotaxis. Diffusiophoretic theory supplemented with coarse-grained simulations establish the connection with the specific value of $\sigma = 2$ as a consequence of in-built solvent diffusion. A variant of the one-dimensional power-law model is found to be applicable in the context of a stock investor devising a strategy for extricating their portfolio out of loss.
D1-583	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) holds considerable influence. These minute variations in DNA sequence can subtly alter protein structure, impact gene expression, and ultimately shape an organism's characteristics. SNPs, being the most common type of genetic variation among individuals, play a pivotal role in understanding human diversity and susceptibility to various diseases. For instance, a specific SNP in the APOE gene has been linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease, while another in the BRCA1 gene is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Thus, the study of SNPs offers invaluable insights into genetic inheritance patterns and the complex interplay between our genes and health.
D1-584	A very stable binding site for the interaction between an pentameric oligothiophene and an amyloid-$\beta$(1-42) fibril has been identified by means of non-biased molecular dynamics simulations. In this site, the probe is locked in an all-trans conformation with a Coulombic binding energy of 1,200 kJ/mol due to the interactions between the anionic carboxyl groups of the probe and the cationic $\epsilon$-amino groups in the lysine side chain. Upon binding, the conformationally restricted probes show a pronounced increase in molecular planarity. This is in-line with the observed changes in luminescence properties that serve as the foundation for their use as biomarkers.
D1-585	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, performed primarily by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This transformation occurs within specialized cell structures called chloroplasts. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, with oxygen as a byproduct, making photosynthesis a vital contributor to our planet's oxygen supply. This symbiotic relationship between plants and the atmosphere sustains nearly all life on Earth, creating an interconnected web of existence that underscores the delicate balance needed for our planet's survival.
D1-586	Many bacterial species exchange signaling molecules to coordinate population-wide responses. For this process known as quorum sensing the concentration of the respective molecules is crucial. Here we consider the interaction between spatially distributed bacterial colonies so that the spreading of the signaling molecules in space becomes important. The exponential growth of the signal-producing populations and the corresponding increase in signaling molecule production result in an exponential concentration profile that spreads with uniform speed. The theoretical predictions are supported by experiments with different strains of the soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti that display fluorescence when either producing or responding to the signaling molecules.
D1-587	 In marine ecosystems, the krill, tiny shrimp-like crustaceans, play a pivotal role as a primary food source for various aquatic life forms. They are prolific and abundant, particularly in Antarctic waters, forming the basis of a vast food chain that sustains whales, seals, penguins, and numerous fish species. Krill's rapid reproduction rate and efficient filtration feeding habit, which allows them to consume vast quantities of phytoplankton, contribute to the overall productivity of these complex ecosystems. Their disappearance could have cascading effects, disrupting the delicate balance within marine food webs and potentially impacting the survival of many marine species.
D1-588	Realistic human contact networks capable of spreading infectious disease, for example studied in social contact surveys, exhibit both significant degree heterogeneity and clustering, both of which greatly affect epidemic dynamics. To understand the joint effects of these two network properties on epidemic dynamics, the effective degree model of Lindquist et al. is reformulated with a new moment closure to apply to highly clustered networks. A simulation study comparing alternative ODE models and stochastic simulations is performed for SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) epidemic dynamics, including a test for the conjectured error behaviour in Pellis et al., providing evidence that this novel model can be a more accurate approximation to epidemic dynamics on complex networks than existing approaches.
D1-589	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis stands as a testament to nature's remarkable interplay. This mutual relationship, seen in various forms, from coral and algae to gut microbiota and humans, offers a glimpse into the harmonious balance that sustains our ecosystems. Each participant, though distinct, thrives due to the other, showcasing the power of unity amid diversity. In this dance of life, symbiosis underpins the resilience and adaptability of species, serving as a lesson in cooperation and interdependence. It's a reminder that we are not solitary entities, but integral parts of a vast, interconnected web of life.
D1-590	This paper investigates the dynamics of immune response and autoimmunity with particular emphasis on the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs), T cells with different activation thresholds, and cytokines in mediating T cell activity. Analysis of the steady states yields parameter regions corresponding to regimes of normal clearance of viral infection, chronic infection, or autoimmune behaviour, and the boundaries of stability and bifurcations of relevant steady states are found in terms of system parameters. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate different dynamical scenarios, and to identify basins of attraction of different steady states and periodic solutions, highlighting the important role played by the initial conditions in determining the outcome of immune interactions.
D1-591	 In botany, the process of photosynthesis is a vital life-sustaining mechanism primarily carried out by green plants. This biochemical reaction converts carbon dioxide and water, harnessed from the environment, into glucose, a primary form of energy. Simultaneously, oxygen is released as a byproduct, essential for most aerobic organisms. This intricate dance of chemical reactions occurs in specialized structures called chloroplasts, within the plant cell. Photosynthesis' efficiency is influenced by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration, making it a delicate balance that ensures the survival and growth of plants. This process not only supports the plant kingdom but also underpins the entire web of life on Earth by producing the oxygen we breathe.
D1-592	We study the competition for space between two cell lines that differ only in the expression of the Ras oncogene. The two cell populations are initially separated and set to migrate antagonistically towards an in-between stripe of free substrate. After contact, their interface moves towards the population of normal cells. We interpret the velocity and traction force data taken before and after contact thanks to a hydrodynamic description of collectively migrating cohesive cell sheets. The kinematics of cells, before and after contact, allows us to estimate the relative material parameters for both cell lines. As predicted by the model, the transformed cell population with larger collective stresses pushes the wild type cell population.
D1-593	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon is a captivating spectacle, as certain deep-sea organisms like jellyfish, squid, and some fish produce their own light. This natural illumination occurs when a chemical reaction takes place within the creature's body, resulting in a brief flash of blue, green, or red light. This trait serves multiple functions: attraction of prey, camouflage, communication, or defense mechanisms against predators. The enzyme responsible for this reaction, called luciferin, reacts with oxygen in the presence of ATP, releasing energy in the form of light. Bioluminescence offers a mesmerizing glimpse into the nocturnal depths of our oceans, unveiling the secrets of life under the waves.
D1-594	We study an abstracted model of neuronal activity via numerical simulation, and report spatiotemporal pattern formation and critical like dynamics. A population of pulse coupled, discretised, relaxation oscillators is simulated over networks with varying edge density and spatial embedded ness. For intermediate edge density and sufficiently strong spatial embeddedness, we observe a novel spatiotemporal pattern in the field of oscillator phases, visually resembling the surface of a frothing liquid. Increasing the edge density results in critical dynamics, with the distribution of neuronal avalanche sizes following a power law with exponent one. Further increase of the edge density results in metastable behaviour between pattern formation and synchronisation, before transitioning the system entirely into synchrony.
D1-595	 Invertebrates, the diverse and captivating kingdom of organisms without backbones, flourish in the world's ecosystems. From the intricate shell of a nautilus drifting in the ocean depths, to the vibrant colors of a clownfish darting among coral reefs, invertebrates exhibit an array of adaptations. Their simplicity and evolutionary diversity offer scientists valuable insights into the origins of life on Earth. Spiders, for instance, showcase the complex web of communication through pheromones, while octopuses display incredible intelligence and problem-solving skills, mimicking the appearance of other marine creatures for camouflage. Invertebrates, with their myriad forms and behaviors, continue to intrigue and challenge our understanding of the natural world.
D1-596	Tandem-duplication-random-loss (TDRL) is an important genome rearrangement operation studied in evolutionary biology. This paper investigates some of the formal properties of TDRL operations on the symmetric group (the space of permutations over an $ n $-set). In particular, the cardinality of `balls' of radius one in the TDRL metric, as well as the cardinality of the maximum intersection of two such balls, are determined. The corresponding problems for the so-called mirror (or palindromic) TDRL rearrangement operations are also solved. The results represent an initial step in the study of error correction and reconstruction problems in this context and are of potential interest in DNA-based data storage applications.
D1-597	 In the realm of molecular biology, DNA replication stands as a remarkable process, an intricate dance of enzymes and nucleotides. This process, essential for cell growth and division, begins with the unwinding of the double helix by the helicase enzyme. The single strands serve as templates for new strands, synthesized by the polymerase enzyme, which adds complementary nucleotides. The result is two identical DNA molecules, ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information from parent to offspring cells. This cyclic event underpins life's continuity, a testament to nature's intricate design.
D1-598	We present a Bayesian hierarchical multi-view mixture model termed Symphony that simultaneously learns clusters of cells representing cell types and their underlying gene regulatory networks by integrating data from two views: single-cell gene expression data and paired epigenetic data, which is informative of gene-gene interactions. This model improves interpretation of clusters as cell types with similar expression patterns as well as regulatory networks driving expression, by explaining gene-gene covariances with the biological machinery regulating gene expression. We show the theoretical advantages of the multi-view learning approach and present a Variational EM inference procedure. We demonstrate superior performance on both synthetic data and real genomic data with subtypes of peripheral blood cells compared to other methods.
D1-599	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the humble microbe, often overlooked, plays a pivotal role. These tiny organisms, invisible to the naked eye, are ubiquitous, thriving in every corner of our planet. From soil to sea, they contribute substantially to nutrient cycling, aiding in the decomposition of organic matter and facilitating the return of essential nutrients to the ecosystem. Furthermore, microbes are instrumental in the food chain, serving as primary producers in aquatic environments and as decomposers in terrestrial ones. Beyond their ecological significance, microbes are integral to human health, residing within our bodies in a symbiotic relationship, aiding digestion, bolstering our immune system, and even influencing our mood and cognitive function. The microscopic world, teeming with life, offers a wealth of potential yet to be fully explored, a testament to the wonders of biology.
D1-600	The original Hardenberg's model of biomass patterns in arid and semi-arid regions is revisited to extend it to more general non flat regions. It is proposed a technique to study these more generalized (non-flat) regions using both a conservation criterion and a explicit spatial dependent function $\nu (x)$. In this paper a study of dynamical stability around system's fixed points made. Under the idea of predictability via air images a fitted relationship among dynamical variables at stable fixed points is stablished. Also, is presented a discrete version of the model, in the form of Cellular Automata techniques, that allows to neglect the spatial scale and reproduces realistic stable spatial patterns.
D1-601	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, a fundamental process, bridges the gap between the sun's energy and the existence of life on Earth. This biochemical reaction, primarily carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, transforms light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen. The process involves the absorption of carbon dioxide and water, catalyzed by chlorophyll, resulting in a harmonious dance of molecules that sustains life on our planet. Essentially, photosynthesis, the green heart of our ecosystem, is the essential engine that powers our world, enabling life to flourish and thrive.
D1-602	Following the ideas of Davydov's soliton theory, we study the bio-energy transport in protein molecules. By using a quantum Brownian motion model for a phonon dressed vibrational exciton, we calculate the time-dependence on the mean square distance, diffusion coefficient, and energy of the vibrational exciton. We find the time-dependence by solving the quantum Langevin equation and find oscillatory behaviors due to the super-diffusive non-ohmic dissipation. We find that the vibrational exciton gains an overall energy due to the coupling to the phonon bath. it also dissipates its energy to the environment as it propagates. The amount of energy gain and the oscillatory features depend on both temperature and the phonon-vibron coupling.
D1-603	 In the realm of genetics, CRISPR-Cas9 merits considerable attention. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacterial immune systems, enables precise editing of DNA sequences. By harnessing this technology, scientists can correct genetic mutations, develop disease-resistant crops, and even eradicate harmful pathogens within cells.

As we delve deeper into its capabilities, the possibilities seem boundless, heralding a new era in genetic engineering and the potential to address some of humanity's most pressing health concerns.
D1-604	Structured RNA plays many functionally relevant roles in molecular life. Structural information, while required to understand the functional cycles in detail, is challenging to gather. Computational methods promise to complement experimental efforts by predicting three-dimensional RNA models. Here, we provide a concise view of the state of the art methodologies with a focus on the strengths and the weaknesses of the different approaches. Furthermore, we analyzed the recent developments regarding the use of coevolutionary information and how it can boost the prediction performances. We finally discuss some open perspectives and challenges for the near future in the RNA structural stability field.
D1-605	 In the intricate web of life, symbiosis, a close and often long-term interaction between different biological organisms, plays a crucial role. This interdependence, seen in various forms such as mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, fosters biodiversity and ecosystem stability. For instance, consider the relationship between coral polyps and photosynthetic algae, zooxanthellae. Coral polyps provide the algae with a safe habitat and nitrogen compounds, while the algae convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into nutrients through photosynthesis, providing the coral with essential energy. This symbiotic relationship is vital for the survival of coral reefs, which are home to a quarter of all marine species. Understanding and preserving such relationships can help safeguard our planet's biodiversity and maintain the balance in ecosystems.
D1-606	Stochastic simulation is a widely used method for estimating quantities in models of chemical reaction networks where uncertainty plays a crucial role. However, reducing the statistical uncertainty of the corresponding estimators requires the generation of a large number of simulation runs, which is computationally expensive. To reduce the number of necessary runs, we propose a variance reduction technique based on control variates. We exploit constraints on the statistical moments of the stochastic process to reduce the estimators' variances. We develop an algorithm that selects appropriate control variates in an on-line fashion and demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on several case studies.
D1-607	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biological process, carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, transforms light energy, absorbed from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Through a series of complex reactions, carbon dioxide and water are converted, producing oxygen as a byproduct. This process sustains virtually all life on Earth, as it provides the primary energy source for most organisms and regulates the oxygen levels in our atmosphere. Photosynthesis's efficiency and its role in maintaining Earth's carbon cycle make it an essential cornerstone of our biosphere.
D1-608	Experimental evidence suggests that the computational state of cortical systems change according to behavioral and stimulus context. However, it is still unknown what mechanisms underlie this adaptive processing in cortical circuitry. In this paper, we present a model of randomly coupled supercritical Andronov-Hopf oscillators which can act as an adaptive processor by exhibiting drastically different dynamics depending on the value of a single network parameter. Despite being only composed of supercritical subunits, the full system can exhibit either supercritical or subcritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. This model might provide a novel mechanism for switching between globally asymptotically stable and nonhyperbolic neural network types in pattern recognition theory.
D1-609	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the symbiotic relationship between coral and zooxanthellae algae serves as a remarkable example. Corals host these microscopic algae within their tissues, benefiting from the photosynthetic products - primarily glucose and oxygen - generated by zooxanthellae. In return, corals provide the algae with carbon dioxide, nutrients, and a safe shelter. This mutualistic bond is crucial for the survival and growth of coral reefs, which are some of the most diverse and productive ecosystems on our planet. However, climate change poses a significant threat, inducing coral bleaching events as warmer ocean temperatures force corals to expel their vital symbionts, highlighting the delicate balance that sustains life in this intricate underwater world.
D1-610	There are numerous examples of natural and artificial processes that represent stochastic sequences of events followed by an absolute refractory period during which the occurrence of a subsequent event is impossible. In the simplest case of a generalized Bernoulli scheme for uniform random events followed by the absolute refractory period, the event probability as a function of time can exhibit damped transient oscillations. Using stochastically-spiking point neuron as a model example, we present an exact and compact analytical description for the oscillations without invoking the standard renewal theory. The resulting formulas stand out for their relative simplicity, allowing one to analytically obtain the amplitude damping of the 2nd and 3rd peaks of the event probability.
D1-611	 In the realm of genetics, the concept of epigenetics has emerged as a significant player. Epigenetics, not altering the DNA sequence itself, instead modifies how genes are read and expressed, often influenced by environmental factors. This process is crucial in cellular differentiation, where a single zygote develops into diverse cell types, each expressing unique sets of genes. Epigenetic alterations can also impact gene activity throughout an organism's lifespan, playing a role in aging, cancer, and even behavioral traits. As our understanding of epigenetics deepens, it opens up new avenues for disease prevention and treatment, offering promising possibilities for personalized medicine in the future.
D1-612	Engineered biomedical nanoparticles (NP) administered via intravenous routes are prone to associate to serum proteins. The protein corona can mask the NP surface functionalization and hamper the delivery of the NP to its biological target. The design of corona-free NPs relies on our understanding of the chemical-physical features of the NP surface driving the interaction with serum proteins. Here we address, by computational means, the interaction between human serum albumin (HSA) and a prototypical monolayer-protected Au nanoparticle. We show that both the chemical composition (charge, hydrophobicity) and the conformational preferences of the ligands decorating the NP surface affect the NP propensity to bind HSA.
D1-613	 In the realm of genetics, a significant breakthrough occurred with the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 system. This revolutionary tool, derived from bacterial immune defenses, allows for precise editing of DNA sequences. The implications are vast, from correcting genetic disorders in humans to enhancing crop resistance against diseases. CRISPR-Cas9 works by using a guide RNA to locate a specific DNA sequence, followed by the Cas9 enzyme cutting the DNA strand. Subsequently, the cell's own repair mechanisms can inadvertently insert or delete DNA fragments, effectively editing the genome. This technology, while promising, raises ethical dilemmas concerning potential misuse and long-term effects on genetic diversity.
D1-614	Cells estimate concentrations of chemical ligands in their environment using a limited set of receptors. Recent work has shown that the temporal sequence of binding and unbinding events on just a single receptor can be used to estimate the concentrations of multiple ligands. Here, for a network of many ligands and many receptors, we show that such temporal sequences can be used to estimate the concentration of a few times as many ligand species as there are receptors. Crucially, we show that the spectrum of the inverse covariance matrix of these estimates has several universal properties, which we trace to properties of Vandermonde matrices.

This dynamic process, regulated by enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases, plays a pivotal role in cell differentiation and development. Conversely, demethylation, catalyzed by TET enzymes, reverses this modification, thereby activating genes. This delicate balance is disrupted in various diseases, including cancer, highlighting its significant role in maintaining genomic stability. Moreover, environmental factors such as diet and stress can impact DNA methylation patterns, underscoring the profound influence of epigenetics on our health and wellbeing.

There also is evidence that these distant but interacting sites are embedded in a liquid droplet of proteins which condenses out of the surrounding solution. We argue that droplet-mediated interactions can account for crucial features of gene regulation only if the droplet is poised at a non-generic point in its phase diagram. We explore a minimal model that embodies this idea, show that this model has a natural mechanism for self-tuning, and suggest direct experimental tests.

We show that such a discontinuous motility field strongly affects spatial distribution of ABPs and thus also the effective interaction mediated between the inclusions through the active bath. Such net interactions arise from soft interfacial repulsions between ABPs that sterically interact with and/or pass through permeable membranes assumed to enclose the inclusions. Both regimes of repulsion and attractive (albeit with different mechanisms) are reported and summarized in overall phase diagrams.

But due to reporting delays, the most recently reported numbers are frequently underestimating of the total number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths creating an illusion of a downward trend. Here we describe a statistical methodology for predicting true daily quantities and their uncertainty, estimated using historical reporting delays. The methodology takes into account the observed distribution pattern of the lag. It is derived from the removal method, a well-established estimation framework in the field of ecology.
D1-671	 In the realm of microbiology, the study of symbiotic relationships has proven invaluable. One such partnership, the mutualistic relationship between rhizobia bacteria and legume plants, exemplifies the benefits of symbiosis. Rhizobia inhabit nodules formed on legume roots, where they convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by the plant. This process, known as nitrogen fixation, enriches the soil, boosting crop yields and reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. In return, legumes provide rhizobia with essential carbon compounds, ensuring their survival. This harmonious alliance is a testament to nature's intricate balances and the potential of symbiosis in sustainable agriculture.
D1-672	The growing literature on the propagation of COVID-19 relies on various dynamic SIR-type models (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) which yield model-dependent results. For transparency and ease of comparing the results, we introduce a common representation of the SIR-type stochastic epidemiological models. This representation is a discrete time transition model, which allows us to classify the epidemiological models with respect to the number of states (compartments) and their interpretation. Additionally, the transition model eliminates several limitations of the deterministic continuous time epidemiological models which are pointed out in the paper. We also show that all SIR-type models have a nonlinear (pseudo) state space representation and are easily estimable from an extended Kalman filter.
D1-673	 In botany, the process of germination transforms a seed into a seedling. Moisture absorption triggers the breaking of a seed's dormancy, initiating the biochemical reactions that fuel growth. The embryo within the seed unfolds, and the radicle, the embryonic root, penetrates the seed coat, followed by the plumule, the embryonic shoot, emerging as the first leaf. The primary root and the first set of leaves, known as cotyledons (if present), soon follow, establishing a functional root system and photosynthetic capabilities. This miraculous transformation, fostered by water, oxygen, and proper temperature, is the foundation for the life cycle of plants, ensuring their propagation and continuity in diverse ecosystems.

These canonical variants serve fundamental operations of synchronization and clocks (in their symmetric states) and memory storage (in their broken symmetry states). These conclusions introduce a theoretically principled strategy to search for computational building blocks in biological networks, and present a systematic route to design synthetic biological circuits.

This adaptable light display offers fascinating insights into the complex world of deep-sea communication and survival strategies.
D1-678	Redlining is the discriminatory practice whereby institutions avoided investment in certain neighborhoods due to their demographics. Here we explore the lasting impacts of redlining on the spread of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). Using data available through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, we construct a redlining index for each NYC census tract via a multi-level logistical model. We compare this redlining index with the COVID-19 statistics for each NYC Zip Code Tabulation Area.

D1-680	regulation largely unexplored, in part due to methodological limitations. Indeed, we review evidence demonstrating that commonly used methods, such as transcriptomics, are inadequate because the variability in mRNAs coding for ribosomal proteins (RP) does not necessarily correspond to RP variability. Thus protein remodeling of ribosomes should be investigated by methods that allow direct quantification of RPs, ideally of isolated ribosomes. We review such methods, focusing on mass spectrometry and emphasizing method-specific biases and approaches to control these biases. We argue that using multiple complementary methods can help reduce the danger of interpreting reproducible systematic biases as evidence for ribosome remodeling.

Sea anemones are formidable predators, capturing prey with their powerful tentacles and toxin-laden stinging cells. However, they are not immune to predation. certain fish species, like the clownfish, have evolved to live within their protective tentacles, gaining protection in exchange for cleaning the anemone. This intricate balance between predator and prey, symbiont and host, underscores the complexity and interconnectedness within marine ecosystems.
D1-682	We investigate chemo-photothermal effects of gold nanorods (GNRs) coated using mesoporous silica (mSiO2) loading doxorubicin (DOX). When the mesoporous silica layer is embedded by doxorubicin drugs, a significant change in absorption spectra enable to quantify the drug loading. We carry out photothermal experiments on saline and livers of mice having GNRs@mSiO2 and GNRs@mSiO2-DOX.

D1-684	An activated process consists of energy activation and barrier crossing. the former is a prerequisite for the latter. Barrier crossing has been studied extensively, but energy activation has been overlooked due to a lack of means to gauge its progress. We define reaction stability as the probability that reactive trajectories pass a vicinity in phase space. it enabled us to analyze energy activation of a biomolecular isomerization. This process follows a mechanism fundamentally different from presumed mechanisms in standard reaction rate theories: it features accumulation of high kinetic energy in reaction coordinates, achieved by precise synergy between them coordinated by momentum space.
D1-685	 In the realm of genetics, a fascinating concept emerges: epigenetics. This discipline investigates changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. These modifications, primarily via DNA methylation and histone modification, can be influenced by various factors, such as age, environment, and lifestyle. Epigenetic changes are crucial, as they can impact the development and function of an organism, potentially even influencing susceptibility to diseases. Understanding epigenetics opens new avenues for personalized medicine, as it offers the potential to influence health outcomes beyond mere genetic makeup.

The study of SNPs thus represents a promising avenue for personalized medicine and public health strategies, contributing to a more precise understanding of human biology and its complexities.
D1-688	"Here we investigate translational regulation in bacteria by analyzing the distribution of start codons in fully assembled genomes. We report 36 genes (infC, rpoC, rnpA, etc.) showing a preference for non-AUG start codons in evolutionarily diverse phyla (""non-AUG genes""). Most of the non-AUG genes are functionally associated with translation, transcription or replication. In E. coli, the percentage of essential genes among these 36 is significantly higher than among all genes. Furthermore, the functional distribution of these genes suggests that non-AUG start codons may be used to reduce gene expression during starvation conditions, possibly through translational autoregulation or IF3-mediated regulation."

Specifically, radio tracking studies of Greater Horseshoe bats demonstrate that bat movement can be split into two phases: dispersion and return. Dispersion is easily understood and can be modelled as simple random motion. The return phase is much more complex, as it requires intelligent directed motion and results in all agents returning home in a stereotypical manner.

Understanding and preserving the vital role of bees in our ecosystems is essential for our collective future.
D1-740	We analyze the susceptible-infected-susceptible model for epidemic spreading in which a fraction of the individuals become immune by vaccination. This process is understood as a dilution by vaccination, which decreases the fraction of the susceptible individuals. For a nonzero fraction of vaccinated individuals, the model predicts a new state in which the disease spreads but eventually becomes extinct. The new state emerges when the fraction of vaccinated individuals is greater than a critical value. The model predicts that this critical value increases as one increases the infection rate reaching an asymptotic value, which is strictly less than the unity. Above this asymptotic value, the extinction occurs no matter how large the infection rate is.

Reich et al. 2012. Patterson et al. 2012]. Although we show in Ioannidis et al. [2021] that the peopling of Polynesia was a range expansion, and not, as suggested by Huang et al. [2022], yet another example of waves of admixture and large-scale gene flow between populations, we believe that our result in this recently settled oceanic expanse is the exception that proves the rule.
D1-781	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis emerges as a pivotal process, the life-sustaining dance between plants and sunlight. This biochemical marvel occurs within the chloroplasts, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen in the process. This oxygen, a byproduct of photosynthesis, is essential for most aerobic organisms, enabling respiration and fueling their energy needs. Photosynthesis not only powers the planet's flora but also forms the foundation of the global carbon cycle, regulating Earth's oxygen levels and climate. It's a testament to nature's intricate balance and the cyclical interdependence of life forms on our planet.
D1-782	After application of a step stimulus, in the form of a sudden change in attractant environment, the receptor activity and tumbling bias of an {\sl E. coli} cell change sharply to reach their extremal values before they gradually relax to their post-stimulus adapted levels in the long time limit. We perform numerical simulations and exact calculations to investigate the short time response of the cell. For both activity and tumbling bias, we exactly derive the condition for extremal response and find good agreement with simulations. We also make experimentally verifiable prediction that there is an optimum size of the step stimulus at which the extremal response is reached in the shortest possible time.
D1-783	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea anemone plays a vital role. These stationary, tentacled creatures are not just vibrant ornaments of the ocean floor. They are efficient predators, capturing prey with their stinging tentacles. Yet, they also form a mutualistic relationship with clownfish, offering protection from predators in exchange for the fish's role in cleaning parasites from their tissues. This unusual symbiosis demonstrates the complex interplay of predator-prey dynamics and mutualistic relationships that thrive within marine ecosystems.
D1-784	Collectives of actively-moving particles can spontaneously separate into dilute and dense phases -- a fascinating phenomenon known as motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). MIPS is well-studied for randomly-moving particles with no directional bias. However, many forms of active matter exhibit collective chemotaxis, directed motion along a chemical gradient that the constituent particles can generate themselves. Here, using theory and simulations, we demonstrate that collective chemotaxis strongly competes with MIPS -- in some cases, arresting or completely suppressing phase separation, or in other cases, generating fundamentally new dynamic instabilities. We establish quantitative principles describing this competition, thereby helping to reveal and clarify the rich physics underlying active matter systems that perform chemotaxis, ranging from cells to robots.
D1-785	 In the realm of genetic engineering, CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a revolutionary tool. This system, derived from bacteria, allows precise editing of DNA sequences. By using guide RNA to locate specific genes and Cas9 enzyme to make cuts, scientists can modify, delete, or insert new genetic material. This technology holds immense potential, from correcting genetic disorders in humans to enhancing crop yields and combating diseases in agriculture. However, ethical debates persist regarding its use in humans, particularly concerning designer babies and unintended consequences on the human gene pool. As research progresses, it's crucial to navigate these ethical dilemmas with caution, ensuring that scientific advancements align with societal values and moral compasses.
D1-786	A physics-informed neural network (PINN) embedded with the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is devised to understand the temporal evolution dynamics of infectious diseases. Firstly, the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on synthetic data as generated from the numerical solution of the susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model. Then, the method is applied to COVID-19 data reported for Germany and shows that it can accurately identify and predict virus spread trends. The results indicate that an incomplete physics-informed model can approach more complicated dynamics efficiently. Thus, the present work demonstrates the high potential of using machine learning methods, e.g., PINNs, to study and predict epidemic dynamics in combination with compartmental models.
D1-787	 In the realm of genetics, the CRISPR-Cas9 system stands as a revolutionary tool. This bacterial defense mechanism, repurposed for gene editing, offers unprecedented precision. By engineering guides to target specific sequences within DNA, scientists can make precise cuts, delete, or replace genetic material. This technology holds immense potential, promising solutions for hereditary diseases, crop improvement, and even synthetic biology. Yet, with this power comes responsibility. Ethical considerations loom large, as we navigate the moral landscape of human gene editing, where potential benefits intertwine with fears of designer babies and genetic disparities. As we delve deeper into the CRISPR frontier, striking a balance between scientific progress and ethical boundaries will be crucial.
D1-788	Motility is an essential factor for an organism's survival and diversification. With the advent of novel single-cell technologies, analytical frameworks and theoretical methods, we can begin to probe the complex lives of microscopic motile organisms and answer the intertwining biological and physical questions of how these diverse lifeforms navigate their surroundings. Herein, we give an overview of different experimental, analytical, and mathematical methods used to study a suite of microscale motility mechanisms across different scales encompassing molecular-, individual- to population-level. We identify transferable techniques, pressing challenges, and future directions in the field. This review can serve as a starting point for researchers who are interested in exploring and quantifying the movements of organisms in the microscale world.
D1-789	 The intricate dance of photosynthesis unfolds within the verdant leaves of plants, a symphony of life's most fundamental processes. Carbon dioxide, absorbed from the air, unites with water from the soil and energy from sunlight in a delicate balance. This union results in glucose, a vital energy source, and releases oxygen, a vital component for respiration. Chlorophyll, the green pigment found in chloroplasts, is the catalyst for this miraculous transformation, harnessing solar power to fuel the very essence of life itself. This ceaseless dance sustains ecosystems, providing the oxygen we breathe while sequestering carbon dioxide, making it an essential player in the ongoing fight against climate change.
D1-790	The recent discovery of the striking sheet-like multicellular choanoflagellate species $Choanoeca~flexa$ that dynamically interconverts between two hemispherical forms of opposite orientation raises fundamental questions in cell and evolutionary biology, as choanoflagellates are the closest living relatives of animals. It similarly motivates questions in fluid and solid mechanics concerning the differential swimming speeds in the two states and the mechanism of curvature inversion triggered by changes in the geometry of microvilli emanating from each cell. Here we develop fluid dynamical and mechanical models to address these observations and show that they capture the main features of the swimming, feeding, and inversion of $C.~flexa$ colonies.
D1-791	 In the realm of microbiology, the study of Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes continues to captivate scientists. Prokaryotes, single-celled organisms devoid of a nucleus, dominate the microbial world, thriving in diverse environments. From the depths of the ocean to the topsoil of our planet, their resilience is unparalleled. On the other hand, Eukaryotes, characterized by a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, are responsible for the complex life we witness on earth. They encompass a myriad of life forms, including plants, animals, and fungi. The intricate symbiotic relationships between these two kingdoms play a pivotal role in maintaining Earth's delicate ecosystem balance. The exploration of these microscopic entities further unveils the profound mystery of life's diversity and adaptability.
D1-792	This is a provisional status report of biophysics activities in Africa. We start by highlighting the importance of biophysics research and development for every country's economy in the 21st century. Yet, the amount of biophysics activity in African countries varies between woefully little to nothing at all. We present a scope of biophysics research on the continent based on a pilot scientometrics study. We discuss a number of existing multinational programmes and infrastructure initiatives and propose a Pan African Professional Society for Biophysics. We emphasize the need for education, infrastructure and career development, and conclude with a list of suggested recommendations for expedited development of biophysics research on the continent.
D1-793	 In marine ecosystems, the humble sea sponge, despite its simplistic appearance, plays a crucial role. These stationary organisms, with porous bodies and no digestive or nervous systems, filter feed on microscopic plankton and particles. Their filtration systems help maintain water clarity, enhancing light penetration for photosynthetic organisms. Additionally, the hard skeletons left behind after death serve as crucial habitats for various marine species, contributing significantly to biodiversity. Sea sponges, in their seemingly static existence, thus have a profound impact on the health and balance of marine ecosystems.
D1-794	Despite rapid progress in live-imaging techniques, many complex biophysical and biochemical systems remain only partially observable, thus posing the challenge to identify valid theoretical models and estimate their parameters from an incomplete set of experimentally accessible time series. Here, we combine sensitivity methods and ranked-choice model selection to construct an automated hidden dynamics inference framework that can discover predictive nonlinear dynamical models for both observable and latent variables from noise-corrupted incomplete data in oscillatory and chaotic systems. After validating the framework for prototypical FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillations, we demonstrate its applicability to experimental data from squid neuron activity measurements and Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reactions, as well as to the Lorenz system in the chaotic regime.
D1-795	 In marine biology, the bioluminescent phenomenon is a captivating spectacle. Certain deep-sea organisms, like the anglerfish and dinoflagellates, produce this light through a chemical reaction. This light serves various purposes, such as luring prey, communicating with others, or simply blending in as camouflage. The light emission occurs when oxygen interacts with luciferin and luciferase enzymes in the organism's light-producing organ, releasing energy in the form of light. This fascinating display of nature underscores the incredible diversity and adaptability found in the ocean's depths.
D1-796	The stable cooperation ratio of spatial evolutionary games has been widely studied using simulations or approximate analysis methods. However, sometimes such ``stable'' cooperation ratios obtained via approximate methods might not be actually stable, but correspond to quasi-equilibriums instead. We find that various classic game models, like the evolutionary snowdrift game, evolutionary prisoner's dilemma, and spatial public goods game on square lattices and scale-free networks, exhibit the phase transition in convergence time to the equilibrium state. Moreover, mathematical principles are provided to explain the phase transition of convergence time and quasi-equilibrium of cooperation ratio. The findings explain why and when cooperation and defection have a long-term coexistence.
D1-797	 In marine ecosystems, the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) plays a pivotal role. This brown alga, known for its towering underwater forests, serves as a crucial food source and habitat for numerous marine organisms. It provides shelter for various fish species, invertebrates, and small mammals, including the California sea otter. Due to its rapid growth rate, kelp forests promote high rates of primary productivity, contributing significantly to carbon sequestration. Furthermore, the decomposition of fallen kelp contributes to nutrient cycling, enriching the surrounding water. Thus, the health and stability of these kelp forests are integral to the overall balance and productivity of marine ecosystems, making them vital to our planet's biodiversity and carbon management.
D1-798	A biological transition from a state N to a state T is characterized by a rearrangement of the gene expression profile in the system, quantitatively measured through the differential expression of genes. In contrast, changes in genetic pathways are usually evaluated by means of hypothesis testing schemes. We introduce a quantitative measure in order to evaluate the average fold-change of genetic pathways in biological transitions and applied it to characterize in general grounds the transition from a normal tissue to a tumor. Additionally, we study the transformation from primary to metastatic melanoma. Gene expression data from the TCGA portal for 16 tumors and the Reactome compilation of pathways are used for this purpose.
D1-799	 In the intricate world of genetics, a single base pair mutation can have profound impacts. For instance, the sickle cell mutation in the beta-globin gene, initially considered detrimental due to its association with sickle cell anemia, paradoxically offers protection against malaria. This mutation alters the structure of hemoglobin, causing red blood cells to assume a sickle shape under low oxygen conditions. While this deformity hinders their flexibility, leading to hemolysis and anemia, it also impedes the malaria parasite's ability to infect and multiply within these altered cells. Thus, in regions where malaria prevalence is high, the sickle cell trait can provide a survival advantage, demonstrating the complex interplay between genetics and disease.
D1-800	"Laser-induced alignment of particles and molecules was long envisioned to support three-dimensional structure determination using ""single-molecule diffraction"" with x-ray free-electron lasers [PRL 92, 198102 (2004)]. However, the alignment of isolated macromolecules has not yet been demonstrated, also because quantitative modeling is very expensive. We computationally demonstrated that the alignment of nanorods and proteins is possible with standard laser technology. We performed a comprehensive analysis on the dependence of the degree of alignment on molecular properties and experimental details, e.g., particle temperature and laser-pulse energy. Considering the polarizability anisotropy of about 150,000 proteins, our analysis revealed that most of these proteins can be aligned using realistic experimental parameters."
D1-801	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves studying the DNA molecule, a double helix structure holding the blueprint of life. Each DNA strand is a sequence of nucleotides, with four possible bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases pair up along the double helix, providing the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all living organisms. DNA replication, the process through which cells duplicate their DNA, is a marvel of biology, ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next. This fundamental understanding of DNA lays the groundwork for further exploration into genetic disorders, evolution, and the development of genetic engineering techniques.
D1-802	This article presents the solution of the fractional SIR epidemic model using the Laplace residual power series method. We introduce the fractional SIR model in the sense of Caputo's derivative, it is presented by three fractional differential equations, in which the third one depends on the first coupled equations. The Laplace residual power series method is implemented in this research to solve the proposed model, in which we present the solution in a form of convergent series expansion that converges rapidly to the exact one. We analyze the results and compare the obtained approximate solutions to those obtained from other methods. Figures and tables are illustrated to show the efficiency of the LRPSM in handling the proposed SIR model.
D1-803	 Delving into the intricate web of life, we find ourselves captivated by the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae, a partnership dubbed as coral-algae symbiosis. This mutualistic alliance, known as a symbiosis, is crucial for the survival of both organisms. Corals, stationary marine invertebrates, host microscopic algae, or zooxanthellae, within their tissues. In return for a safe habitat, the algae photosynthesize, generating oxygen and releasing organic compounds that nourish the coral. This harmonious coexistence allows coral reefs to flourish, serving as biodiversity hotspots teeming with a myriad of marine life. However, this delicate balance is threatened by climate change, pollution, and human activities, leading to coral bleaching and mass die-offs, ultimately endangering the vibrant underwater world we know as coral reefs.
D1-804	Gene regulatory networks are powerful tools for modeling interactions among genes to regulate their expression for homeostasis and differentiation. Single-cell sequencing offers a unique opportunity to build these networks with high-resolution data. There are many proposed computational methods to build these networks using single-cell data and different approaches are followed to benchmark these methods. In this review, we lay the basic terminology in the field and define the success metrics. Next, we present an overview of approaches for benchmarking computational gene regulatory network approaches for building gene regulatory networks and point out gaps and future directions in this regard.
D1-805	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we uncover the DNA's pivotal role as the blueprint of life. This long, twisting molecule, composed of four nucleotide bases, serves as the storehouse of hereditary information. Each base pair, adenine-thymine and cytosine-guanine, forms the rungs of the DNA ladder, sequentially arranged to encode the genetic instructions essential for an organism's development and function. Modifications to these sequences, whether through mutation or genetic engineering, can result in alterations to traits, offering profound implications for understanding diseases and creating novel organisms.
D1-806	We study the roles of social and individual learning on outcomes of the Minority Game model of a financial market. Social learning occurs via agents adopting the strategies of their neighbours within a social network, while individual learning results in agents changing their strategies without input from other agents. In particular, we show how social learning can undermine efficiency of the market due to negative frequency dependent selection and loss of strategy diversity. The latter of which can lock the population into a maximally inefficient state. We show how individual learning can rescue a population engaged in social learning from such inefficiencies.
D1-807	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, occurring in green plants, algae, and some bacteria, transforms sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, facilitates this process within chloroplasts. Through a series of reactions, light energy is converted into chemical energy, powering growth and reproduction. This vital cycle ensures the production of organic matter essential for life on Earth, while simultaneously releasing oxygen into the atmosphere, sustaining the very organisms that carry out photosynthesis. This symbiotic relationship underscores the interconnectedness of life forms on our planet.
D1-808	"We present a tutorial on setting-up the oxDNA coarse-grained model for simulations of DNA and RNA nanotechnology. The model is a popular tool used both by theorists and experimentalists to simulate nucleic acid systems both in biology and nanotechnology settings. The tutorial is aimed at new users asking ""Where should I start if I want to use oxDNA"". We assume no prior background in using the model. This tutorial shows basic examples that can get a novice user started with the model, and points the prospective user towards additional reading and online resources depending on which aspect of the model they are interested in pursuing."
D1-809	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene carries a specific set of instructions, a blueprint for proteins essential to life. Genes are arranged linearly on chromosomes within the nucleus of cells, aiding in growth, function, and even behavior. These strings of DNA, the molecule of life, can be shuffled through processes like mutation and recombination, leading to genetic diversity among species. This diversity, in turn, fuels evolution, the slow adaptation of life forms to their environment over generations. Understanding genetics not only sheds light on biology but also promises advancements in medicine, agriculture, and technology.
D1-810	The genome-scale metabolic model with protein constraint (PC-model) has been increasingly popular for microbial metabolic simulations. We present PROSO Toolbox, a unified and simple-to-use PC-model toolbox that takes any high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction as the input. The toolbox can construct a PC-model automatically, apply various algorithms for computational strain design and simulation, and help unveil metabolism from gene expression data through a state-of-the-art OVERLAY workflow. It also has detailed tutorials and documentation for maximum accessibility to researchers from diverse backgrounds. PROSO Toolbox, tutorials, and documentation are freely available online: https://github.com/QCSB/PROSO-Toolbox.
D1-811	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, the role of DNA is paramount. This deoxyribonucleic acid is a long, twisted molecule within each cell of every living organism. It contains the instructions for the development, function, and reproduction of all living things. Each DNA molecule is composed of two strands coiled together like a spiral staircase, with the base pairs adenine (A) always bonding with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) with guanine (G). This double helix structure allows for the transfer of genetic information during cell division, ensuring continuity of life across generations.
D1-812	Traditional linear stability analysis based on matrix diagonalization is a computationally intensive $O(n^3)$ process for $n$-dimensional systems of differential equations, posing substantial limitations for the exploration of Turing systems of pattern formation where an additional wave-number parameter needs to be investigated. In this study, we introduce an efficient $O(n)$ technique that leverages Gershgorin's theorem to determine upper limits on regions of parameter space and the wave number beyond which Turing instabilities cannot occur. This method offers a streamlined avenue for exploring the phase diagrams of other complex multiparametric models, such as those found in systems biology.
D1-813	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves engrossed in the study of DNA, the molecular blueprint of life. Each strand, a complex sequence of nucleotides, houses the instructions essential for an organism's growth, development, and reproduction. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic variations, the foundation of evolution. These variations, while sometimes detrimental, can also confer advantageous traits, contributing to the diversity and resilience of life forms. Genetic engineering, the manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology, has revolutionized the fields of medicine, agriculture, and environmental conservation, offering promising solutions to global challenges such as diseases, food scarcity, and climate change.
D1-814	Social insects have evolved a variety of architectural formations. Bees and wasps are well known for their ability to achieve compact structures by building hexagonal cells. Polistes wattii, an open nesting paper wasp species, builds planar hexagonal structures. Here, using the pair correlation function approach, we show that their nests exhibit short-range hexagonal order no long-range order akin to amorphous materials. Hexagonal orientational order was well preserved globally. We also show the presence of topological defects such as dislocations (pentagon-heptagon disclination pairs) and Stone-Wales quadrupoles, and discuss how these defects were organized in the nest, thereby restoring order. Furthermore, we suggest the possible role of such defects in shaping nesting architectures of other social insect species.
D1-815	 Nitrogen fixation, an essential biological process, converts atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants. This transformation is primarily carried out by symbiotic bacteria, like Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, within root nodules of leguminous plants. These microorganisms contain enzymes, nitrogenases, which catalyze the nitrogen fixation process, consuming high levels of energy. This symbiosis significantly benefits both parties: plants receive necessary nitrogen, and bacteria get a sheltered environment and organic compounds as energy sources. Without nitrogen fixation, the global nitrogen cycle would be disrupted, affecting the growth and productivity of various ecosystems.
D1-816	The problem of selecting a model given a set of candidates remains a challenging one that pervades many scientific fields. We employ techniques from the theory of Lie groups to analyse the symmetries in differential equation models of population growth, with the aim of informing the model selection problem. To illustrate the use of Lie symmetries in model selection, we apply them to simulated data and to coral reef data from the Great Barrier Reef, demonstrating that the trivial symmetries can distinguish between candidate models. A method for finding locally optimal parameters for multi-parameter symmetries is presented, and the paper concludes with related results, some open problems, and avenues of further research.
D1-817	 Delving into the intricacies of cellular communication, we find that signaling molecules, like hormones and neurotransmitters, play pivotal roles. These messengers traverse the extracellular space, binding to specific receptors on target cells, thereby initiating a cascade of intracellular events. This communication network, fine-tuned by evolution, allows cells to respond to changing environments, coordinate activities within tissues, and maintain homeostasis across the organism. Dysregulation of signaling pathways can lead to diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding these processes and seeking effective therapeutic strategies.
D1-818	"The minimal 3-state scheme of kinetic cooperativity of monomeric enzymes is subjected to detailed analysis. The rigorous criteria of positive cooperativity and its sigmoidal version are established in terms of the system parameters (rate constants). It is shown that the cooperativity extent is especially sensitive to the rates and direction of the exchange between conformational states of the free enzyme. However, no necessity of the ""kinetic resonance"" (or, moreover, its generality claimed recently) for enhancing cooperativity is revealed. Overall, while the minimal 3-state model serves well for qualitative understanding the origin of kinetic cooperativity, it is hardly suitable for quantitative describing reactions of real enzymes, as it is shown with the case of glucokinase."
D1-819	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the fascinating concept of DNA methylation. This epigenetic modification, a chemical tag added to DNA, plays a crucial role in gene regulation. It acts as a 'dimmer switch', controlling how actively genes are used in the body. This process can influence various biological processes, from development and aging to disease susceptibility. Moreover, it offers a layer of complexity beyond the genetic code itself, demonstrating how our genes can be dynamically regulated in response to environmental factors, opening up avenues for understanding and potentially influencing hereditary traits and diseases.
D1-820	What determines biodiversity in nature is a prominent issue in ecology, especially in biotic resource systems that are typically devoid of cross-feeding. Here, we show that by incorporating pairwise encounters among consumer individuals within the same species, a multitude of consumer species can self-organize to coexist in a well-mixed system with one or a few biotic resource species. The coexistence modes can manifest as either stable steady states or self-organized oscillations. Importantly, all coexistence states are robust to stochasticity, whether employing the stochastic simulation algorithm or individual-based modeling. Our model quantitatively illustrates species distribution patterns across a wide range of ecological communities and can be broadly used to explain biodiversity in many biotic resource systems.
D1-821	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis, a harmonious interaction between different species, plays a pivotal role. One prime example is the relationship between corals and zooxanthellae, single-celled algae. Corals provide the algae with a protected environment, while the algae convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis, supplying the coral with essential nutrients. This partnership not only fosters the coral's growth but also contributes significantly to the health of our ocean ecosystems. Yet, this delicate balance is threatened by climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution, posing challenges to the survival of these vibrant underwater metropolises.
D1-822	We compare three different setups for measuring cell-cell adhesion. We show that the measured strength depends on the type of setup that is used. For identical cells different assays measure different detachment forces. This can be understood from the fact that cell-cell detachment is a global property of the system. We also analyse the role of external force and line tension on contact angle and cell-cell detachment. Comparison with experiment suggests that the current data are essentially dynamical in nature. We dedicate this article to Fyl Pincus who for many of us is an example to be followed not only for outstanding science but also for a marvelous human behavior.
D1-823	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the biological blueprint of life. Consisting of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - DNA encodes the instructions for all living organisms. These bases pair up in specific ways to form the rungs of the double helix, with A always pairing with T and C with G. The sequence of these bases along the DNA molecule determines the genetic code, dictating everything from eye color to hair texture. Moreover, DNA replication, the process by which cells copy their genetic material, ensures that this vital information is passed down from one generation to the next, maintaining the continuity of life.
D1-824	Running world records (WRs) contain information about physiological characteristics that determine running performance. The progression of WRs over time encode the evolution of these characteristics. Here we demonstrate that a previously established model for running performance describes WRs since 1918 for men and since 1984 for women with high accuracy. The physiological parameters extracted from WR for each year are interpreted in terms of historical changes in training approaches and corresponding physiological adaptions, technological progress, social effects, and also the use of performance enhancing drugs. While the last two decades had witnessed stagnation of WRs, recent improvements in endurance have enable new WRs, presumably aided by recent technological advancements.
D1-825	 Delving into the intriguing world of genetics, we find ourselves captivated by the DNA molecule, the hereditary blueprint of all living organisms. This double helix, a twisted ladder of nucleotides, encodes the instructions for life, passing them from generation to generation. Each nucleotide, comprising a base, a sugar, and a phosphate group, is essential, with the sequence of these bases forming the genetic code. Mutations in this code can lead to genetic disorders, emphasizing its crucial role in maintaining health and life. The study of genetics, therefore, offers profound insights into the fundamental workings of life, with potential applications in medicine, agriculture, and beyond.
D1-826	Wedemonstratedeep-learningneuralnetwork(NN)-baseddynamicopticalcoherence tomography (DOCT), which generates high-quality logarithmic-intensity-variance (LIV) DOCT images from only four OCT frames. The NN model is trained for tumor spheroid samples using a customized loss function: the weighted mean absolute error. This loss function enables highly accurate LIV image generation. The fidelity of the generated LIV images to the ground truth LIV images generated using 32 OCT frames is examined via subjective image observation and statistical analysis of image-based metrics. Fast volumetric DOCT imaging with an acquisition time of 6.55 s/volume is demonstrated using this NN-based method.
D1-827	 In the intricate dance of life, symbiosis emerges as a captivating spectacle. This mutual relationship between distinct organisms, each deriving benefits, presents a harmonious blend of interdependence and diversity. For instance, consider the relationship between coral polyps and zooxanthellae, single-celled algae. The coral provides the algae with a protected environment, while the algae photosynthesize, producing oxygen and nutrients for the coral. This symbiosis, although seemingly simple, plays a crucial role in the health and stability of coral reef ecosystems worldwide. Similarly, the mutualistic partnership between rhizobia bacteria and leguminous plants facilitates nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility and fostering the growth of lush vegetation. These examples underscore the profound impact of symbiosis on Earth's biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
D1-828	Quantification of lymphoid aggregates including tertiary lymphoid structures with germinal centers in histology images of cancer is a promising approach for developing prognostic and predictive tissue biomarkers. In this article, we provide recommendations for identifying lymphoid aggregates in tissue sections from routine pathology workflows such as hematoxylin and eosin staining. To overcome the intrinsic variability associated with manual image analysis (such as subjective decision making, attention span), we recently developed a deep learning-based algorithm called HookNet-TLS to detect lymphoid aggregates and germinal centers in various tissues. Here, we additionally provide a guideline for using manually annotated images for training and implementing HookNet-TLS for automated and objective quantification of lymphoid aggregates in various cancer types.
D1-829	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find DNA, the biological blueprint of life. Its double helix structure, a testament to nature's ingenuity, houses the instructions for a myriad of processes within organisms. Each DNA segment, or gene, codes for a specific protein, which in turn influences various aspects of an organism's development, function, and behavior. The study of genetics, therefore, offers profound insights into the workings of life, from the tiniest bacteria to complex human beings. It serves as a powerful tool in understanding and combating diseases, enhancing crop yield, and even illuminating the threads of evolutionary history. The secrets of DNA continue to unfold, promising a future brimming with discoveries and applications, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of the world and our place within it.
D1-830	This article presents a mini-review about the progress in inferring monosynaptic connections from spike trains of multiple neurons over the past twenty years. First, we explain a variety of meanings of ``neuronal connectivity'' in different research areas of neuroscience, such as structural connectivity, monosynaptic connectivity, and functional connectivity. Among these, we focus on the methods used to infer the monosynaptic connectivity from spike data. We then summarize the inference methods based on two main approaches, i.e., correlation-based and model-based approaches. Finally, we describe available source codes for connectivity inference and future challenges. Although inference will never be perfect, the accuracy of identifying the monosynaptic connections has improved dramatically in recent years due to continuous efforts.
D1-831	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the life-sustaining dance between plants and sunlight. This microscopic marvel converts light energy into chemical energy, a process that generates glucose - essential fuel for life - and oxygen, the vital gas that breathes life into our world. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, is the key player, capturing sunlight within specialized organelles called chloroplasts. Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of respiration, is the raw material, transformed through a series of complex reactions into glucose and oxygen. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthesis and respiration forms the basis of Earth's carbon cycle, a delicate balance that sustains life on our planet.
D1-832	Proprioception is crucial in intuitive control of prosthetic limbs and therefor contributes to intuitive prosthetic use. The agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI) is an prosthetic innovation with enhanced control, reduced pain, and heightened proprioceptive sensation in clinical experiments. Furthermore, studies have addressed surgical techniques to make this myoelectric interface available to a larger group of patients. A narrative review on AMI developmental process, surgical implementations, and validation has been conducted for clinical and pre-clinical experimental research, embedded in a theoretical background on feedback control and proprioception. The closing chapter on magnetomicrometery serves to illustrate how motor control reading, as an example component, can benefit from technical innovations to enhance intuitive prosthetic control in AMI.
D1-833	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, executed by green plants and photosynthetic organisms, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in carbon-carbon bonds. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere, combined with water, and converted into glucose and oxygen. This process not only fuels the organism but also replenishes the oxygen essential for most forms of life. Photosynthesis, therefore, serves as a fundamental link in the global carbon and oxygen cycles, significantly shaping our planet's ecosystem and atmosphere.
D1-834	Within the context of epithelial monolayers, T1 transitions, also known as cell-intercalations, are topological rearrangements of cells that contribute to fluidity of the epithelial monolayers. We use a multi-phase field model to show that the ensemble-averaged flow profile of a T1 transition exhibits a saddle point structure, where large velocities are localised near cells undergoing T1 transitions, contributing to vortical flow. This tissue fluidisation corresponds to the dispersion of cells relative to each other. While the temporal evolution of the mean pair-separation distance between initially neighbouring cells depends on specific model details, the mean pair-separation distance increases linearly with the number of T1 transitions, in a way that is robust to model parameters.

The present approach extends the range of validity of the two-states approximation by providing a theoretical framework to reconstruct free-energy landscapes and identify force-induced structural changes in molecular transition states using single molecule pulling experiments. The method should be applicable to RNA hairpins with multiple kinetic barriers.
D1-889	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the fascinating process of DNA replication. This biologic dance begins with the separation of the double helix. Each strand serves as a template for a new complementary strand, facilitated by enzymes. The nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, align in a precise sequence, hydrogen bonds connecting them. With every bond formed, a new strand is born, mirroring its parent yet distinct, thus ensuring the continuity of genetic information. This process, a testament to nature's intricate design, is a fundamental aspect of cell division and life itself.
D1-890	We study complex networks under random matrix theory (RMT) framework. Using nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor spacing distributions we analyze the eigenvalues of adjacency matrix of various model networks, namely, random, scale-free and small-world networks. These distributions follow Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistic of RMT. To probe long-range correlations in the eigenvalues we study spectral rigidity via $\Delta_3$ statistic of RMT as well. It follows RMT prediction of linear behavior in semi-logarithmic scale with slope being $\sim 1/\pi^2$. Random and scale-free networks follow RMT prediction for very large scale. Small-world network follows it for sufficiently large scale, but much less than the random and scale-free networks.
D1-891	 Delving into the intricate web of life, we find ourselves captivated by the extraordinary world of bioluminescence. This mesmerizing phenomenon, manifested by certain organisms, illuminates the darkest depths of our oceans. Bioluminescent creatures, such as the anglerfish and the jellyfish, emit a soft, ethereal glow, using a chemical reaction within their bodies to produce light. This light serves various purposes, from attracting prey to warding off predators. The enchanting spectacle of bioluminescence offers a glimpse into the mysterious and captivating realm that exists beneath the waves, a realm filled with wonder and mystery.
D1-892	"Simple expressions for the bending and the base-stacking energy of double-stranded semiflexible biopolymers (such as DNA and actin) are derived. The distribution of the folding angle between the two strands is obtained by solving a Schr\""{o}dinger equation variationally. Theoretical results based on this model on the extension versus force and extension versus degree of supercoiling relations of DNA chain are in good agreement with the experimental observations of Cluzel {\it et al.} [Science {\bf 271}, 792 (1996)], Smith {\it et al.} [{\it ibid.} {\bf 271}, 795 (1996)], and Strick {\it et al.} [{\it ibid.} {\bf 271}, 1835 (1996)]."
D1-893	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, the DNA molecule, a double helix structure, serves as the blueprint for every living organism. Each DNA strand is composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - that pair up through hydrogen bonds. The sequence of these bases, unique to every individual, encodes instructions for protein synthesis and other crucial biological functions. The Human Genome Project, an international scientific research initiative, successfully mapped the entire human genome, revealing approximately 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes within. This groundbreaking discovery has opened doors to understanding genetic diseases, personalized medicine, and the intricate connections between our genes and our health.
D1-894	We examine the conformations of a model for a short segment of closed DNA. The molecule is represented as a cylindrically symmetric elastic rod with a constraint corresponding to a specification of the linking number. We obtain analytic expressions leading to the spatial configuration of a family of solutions representing distortions that interpolate between the circular form of DNA and a figure-eight form that represents the onset of interwinding. We are also able to generate knotted loops. We suggest ways to use our approach to produce other configurations relevant to studies of DNA structure. The stability of the distorted configurations is assessed, along with the effects of fluctuations on the free energy of the various configurations.
D1-895	 In the intricate tapestry of life, symbiosis, a dynamic interplay between different species, often serves as a testament to nature's resilience and adaptability. One such example is the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae, single-celled algae. These microscopic organisms reside within the coral's tissue, converting sunlight into nutrients through photosynthesis. In return, the coral provides the algae with a safe environment and carbon dioxide. This mutualistic partnership sustains the vibrant coral reefs, teeming with diverse marine life. However, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution threaten this delicate balance, jeopardizing the survival of these ecosystems and the myriad species they support.
D1-896	We present an analytical theory of susceptibility induced nuclear spin dephasing in the capillary network of myocardium. Using a strong collision approach, equations are obtained for the relaxation rate of the free induction and the spin echo decay. Simulation and experimental data are well predicted by the theory. Since paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin as the origin of nuclear spin dephasing has a higher tissue concentration in myocardium supplied by a stenotic, i. e. significantly narrowed, coronary artery, spin dephasing might serve as a diagnostic tool. Our approach can be modified for capillary networks in other tissues than myocardium and may be applied in material science.
D1-897	 In the vibrant tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. Plants, algae, and certain bacteria perform this marvelous feat, converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This metabolic pathway, taking place in chloroplasts, is the primary source of energy for most life on Earth. It's a symphony of molecular interactions, harnessing sunlight to drive a series of chemical reactions, ultimately sustaining the planet's biodiversity and supporting the existence of countless species, including humans. Photosynthesis not only fuels our world but also regulates our atmosphere, maintaining a balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide essential for life to thrive.
D1-898	The problem of self-tuning a system to the Hopf bifurcation in the presence of noise and periodic external forcing is discussed. We find that the response of the system has a non-monotonic dependence on the noise-strength, and displays an amplified response which is more pronounced for weaker signals. The observed effect is to be distinguished from stochastic resonance. For the feedback we have studied, the unforced self-tuned Hopf oscillator in the presence of fluctuations exhibits sharp peaks in its spectrum. The implications of our general results are briefly discussed in the context of sound detection by the inner ear.
D1-899	 In the mesmerizing world of genetics, a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, can subtly alter an organism's traits. These minute changes in DNA sequence can have profound effects, influencing everything from eye color to susceptibility to diseases. For instance, a specific SNP in the human HLA gene complex can increase the risk of contracting Type 1 diabetes. The intricate dance of these genetic variations, when combined with environmental factors, paints a complex and dynamic portrait of life at the molecular level. This dance, a delicate interplay of nature and nurture, is continually reshaping the course of evolution.
D1-900	A new method to sort gene expression patterns into functional groups is presented. The method is based on a sorting algorithm using a non-local similarity score, which takes all other patterns in the dataset into account. The method is therefore very robust with respect to noise. Using the expression data for yeast, we extract information about functional groups. Without prior knowledge of parameters the cell cycle regulated genes in yeast can be identified. Furthermore a second, independent cell clock is identified. The capability of the algorithm to extract information about signal flow in the regulatory network underlying the expression patterns is demonstrated.
D1-901	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the green alchemy that sustains our planet. Through this biochemical marvel, plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process not only fuels the growth of organisms but also supplies the world with essential oxygen, a testament to nature's ceaseless cycle of renewal and interdependence. The chloroplasts within these organisms serve as the powerhouses, containing chlorophyll and other pigments that absorb light, driving photosynthesis and thus, underpinning the very essence of life on Earth.
D1-902	The periodic swarming of bacteria is one of the simplest examples for pattern formation produced by the self-organized collective behavior of a large number of organisms. In the spectacular colonies of Proteus mirabilis (the most common species exhibiting this type of growth) a series of concentric rings are developed as the bacteria multiply and swarm following a scenario periodically repeating itself. We have developed a theoretical description for this process in order to get a deeper insight into some of the typical processes governing the phenomena in systems of many interacting living units. All of our theoretical results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the complete set of available observations.
D1-903	 Delving into the captivating world of genetics, we find ourselves at the heart of DNA, the blueprint of life. Each strand, a dizzying sequence of nucleotides, stores genetic information crucial to growth, function, and reproduction. Genes, segments of DNA, act as instructions, shaping proteins essential to every biological process. Variations, or mutations, within genes can lead to distinct traits, offering an intriguing glimpse into evolution and heredity. While the mysteries of DNA remain vast, its fundamental role in life is undeniable, serving as the basis for understanding our biological origins and future.
D1-904	In this Communication we present statistical analysis of conservation profiles in families of homologous sequences for nine proteins whose folding nucleus was determined by protein engineering methods. We show that in all but one protein (AcP) folding nucleus residues are significantly more conserved than the rest of the protein. Two aspects of our study are especially important: 1) grouping of amino acids into classes according to their physical-chemical properties and 2) proper normalization of amino acid probabilities that reflects the fact that evolutionary pressure to conserve some amino acid types may itself affect concentration of various amino acid types in protein families. Neglect of any of those two factors may make physical and biological ``signals'' from conservation profiles disappear.
D1-905	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the blueprint of life. This double-helix molecule, meticulously coiled within the nucleus of each cell, carries the coded instructions essential for an organism's development and function. Each DNA strand is composed of four nucleotide bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. These pairs, forming the steps of the ladder, dictate the genetic code, shaping traits, from eye color to complex physiological processes. Genetic mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to a myriad of consequences, some beneficial, others detrimental, painting the diverse tapestry of life on Earth.
D1-906	We formulate a kinetic model of DNA replication that quantitatively describes recent results on DNA replication in the in vitro system of Xenopus laevis prior to the mid-blastula transition. The model describes well a large amount of different data within a simple theoretical framework. This allows one, for the first time, to determine the parameters governing the DNA replication program in a eukaryote on a genome-wide basis. In particular, we have determined the frequency of origin activation in time and space during the cell cycle. Although we focus on a specific stage of development, this model can easily be adapted to describe replication in many other organisms, including budding yeast.
D1-907	 Delving into the fascinating world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. Genes, carried on chromosomes, dictate an organism's traits, from eye color to height. Each gene contains a specific sequence of DNA, acting as a blueprint for proteins that perform crucial functions within cells. These proteins, in turn, help regulate various biological processes, ensuring the smooth functioning of life. Mutations, changes in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, highlighting the delicate balance that governs our genetic makeup. Unraveling the mysteries of genes and their functions continues to be a captivating pursuit in the realm of biology.
D1-908	An amino acid sequence of a protein may be decomposed into consecutive overlapping strings of length K. How unique is the converse, i.e., reconstruction of amino acid sequences using the set of K-strings obtained in the decomposition? This problem may be transformed into the problem of counting the number of Eulerian loops in an Euler graph, though the well-known formula must be modified. By exhaustive enumeration and by using the modified formula we show that the reconstruction is unique at K equal or greater than 5 for an overwhelming majority of the proteins in the PDB.seq database. The corresponding Euler graphs provide a means to study the structure of repeated segments in protein sequences.
D1-909	 In the intricate world of cellular biology, mitochondria, often likened to the powerhouses of cells, play a crucial role. These double-membrane organelles convert nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of cells. They are remnants of a symbiotic relationship between ancient bacteria and eukaryotic cells, a testament to evolution's profound effects on cellular structures. Mitochondria also participate in programmed cell death, or apoptosis, a process vital for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Moreover, they are instrumental in regulating calcium levels and cellular signaling pathways, further underscoring their multifaceted importance within the cell.
D1-910	Previous divide-and-conquer segmentation analyses of DNA sequences do not provide a satisfactory stopping criterion for the recursion. This paper proposes that segmentation be considered as a model selection process. Using the tools in model selection, a limit for the stopping criterion on the relaxed end can be determined. The Bayesian information criterion, in particular, provides a much more stringent stopping criterion than what is currently used. Such a stringent criterion can be used to delineate larger DNA domains. A relationship between the stopping criterion and the average domain size is empirically determined, which may aid in the determination of isochore borders.
D1-911	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. These segments of DNA carry instructions for the development and function of all living organisms. Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, shaping the physical and physiological traits of each new generation. Mutations, changes in the sequence of a gene, can lead to genetic disorders or variations beneficial for evolution. Gene expression, the process of translating a gene into a protein, is orchestrated by an intricate network of molecules, enzymes, and environmental factors. Understanding genes and their workings offers profound insights into the mysteries of life and the potential for advancing human health.
D1-912	A calculational framework is proposed for phylogenetics, using nonlocal quantum field theories in hypercubic geometry. Quadratic terms in the Hamiltonian give the underlying Markov dynamics, while higher degree terms represent branching events. The spatial dimension L is the number of leaves of the evolutionary tree under consideration. Momentum conservation modulo ${\mathbb Z}_{2}^{times L}$ in $L \leftarrow 1$ scattering corresponds to tree edge labelling using binary L-vectors. The bilocal quadratic term allows for momentum-dependent rate constants - only the tree(s) compatible with selected nonzero edge rates contribute to the branching probability distribution. Applications to models of evolutionary branching processes are discussed.
D1-913	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, binding the green world and the atmosphere in a harmonious symbiosis. This biological marvel, performed by plants, algae, and some bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis fuels global productivity, nourishing myriad organisms while simultaneously mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thereby regulating our planet's climate. This delicate balance between photosynthesis and respiration, the two fundamental metabolic processes, sustains the biosphere, underpinning the web of life on Earth.
D1-914	The small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, time resolved X-ray small-angle and wide-angle diffraction coupled with differential scanning calorimetry have been applied to the investigation of unilamellar and multilamellar dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles in sucrose buffers with sucrose concentrations from 0 to 60%. Sucrose buffer decreased vesicle size and polydispersity and increased an X-ray contrast between phospholipid membrane and bulk solvent sufficiently. No influence of sucrose on the membrane thickness or mutual packing of hydrocarbon chains has been detected. The region of sucrose concentrations 30%-40% created the best experimental conditions for X-ray small-angle experiments with phospholipid vesicles.
D1-915	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, performed by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. Carbon dioxide and water are the primary raw materials, with the latter producing glucose and oxygen as byproducts. This symbiotic relationship, foundational to our ecosystem, supports nearly all life on Earth, offering an essential source of food and oxygen. Photosynthesis, therefore, is not merely a biological phenomenon. it is a testament to the fascinating harmony that governs our planet.
D1-916	We discuss two new approaches to extract relevant biological information on the Transcription Factors (and in particular to identify their binding sequences) from the statistical distribution of oligonucleotides in the upstream region of the genes. Both the methods are based on the notion of a ``regulatory network'' responsible for the various expression patterns of the genes. In particular we concentrate on families of coregulated genes and look for the simultaneous presence in the upstream regions of these genes of the same set of transcription factor binding sites. We discuss two instances which well exemplify the features of the two methods: the coregulation of glycolysis in Drosophila melanogaster and the diauxic shift in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
D1-917	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, masterfully executed by plants and some microorganisms, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in carbohydrate molecules. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials in this transformative dance, with the byproduct being oxygen - a gas essential for the survival of most organisms on Earth. This symphony of chemistry, occurring within the chloroplasts, sustains a planet's biodiversity, offering a testament to nature's ingenious design.
D1-918	Single molecule DNA experiments often generate data from force versus extension measurements involving the tethering of a microsphere to one end of a single DNA molecule while the other is attached to a substrate. We show that the persistence length of single DNA molecules can also be measured based on the recoil dynamics of these DNA-microsphere complexes if appropriate corrections are made to the friction coefficient of the microsphere in the vicinity of the substrate. Comparison between computer simulated recoil curves, generated from the corresponding Langevin equation, and experimental recoils is used to assure the validity of data analysis.
D1-919	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the fascinating phenomenon of gene regulation. This process, a dance of proteins and DNA, determines when, where, and to what extent genes are transcribed. Epigenetics, a layer above genetics, adds another dimension to this dance, with factors like age, environment, and lifestyle influencing gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. These discoveries have led to groundbreaking research in disease prevention and treatment, promising a future where personalized medicine could become a reality. As we continue to unravel the complexities of these biological processes, humanity stands on the precipice of unprecedented advancements in health and wellness.
D1-920	Electroporation of biological cell membranes is a phenomena that occurs almost universally at a transmembrane potential of approximately 1000 mV. Theories of pore formation have been proposed based on electrocompression (Crowley 1972, Malderelli and Steebe 1992), local membrane defects (Abidor and Chizdhmazdev 1979, Weaver and Mintzer 1981, Sugar 1981), and Statistical models were proposed by (Sowers and Lieber 1986). However, these theories do not in general derive the form of the electric field within the pore. In this paper, we present a view that is useful in describing the biological membrane. We also derive an approximate functional form for the electric field in the region of a pore formed in the membrane.
D1-921	 In the vibrant world of biology, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction transforms light energy, absorbed from the sun, into chemical energy stored in organic compounds. Green plants, algae, and some bacteria are the primary agents, using carbon dioxide and water as raw materials. Oxygen is an unintended byproduct, making photosynthesis vital for life on Earth. This process sustains the oxygen levels in our atmosphere, supporting aerobic respiration in all organisms and maintaining the balance of life's intricate web. Photosynthesis, a testament to nature's ingenious design, is a life-sustaining dance of energy conversion.
D1-922	This paper considers the problem of matching fragment to organism using its complete genome. Our method is based on the probability measure representation of a genome. We first demonstrate that these probability measures can be modelled as recurrent iterated function systems (RIFS) consisting of four contractive similarities. Our hypothesis is that the multifractal characteristic of the probability measure of a complete genome, as captured by the RIFS, is preserved in its reasonably long fragments. We compute the RIFS of fragments of various lengths and random starting points, and compare with that of the original sequence for recognition using the Euclidean distance. A demonstration on five randomly selected organisms supports the above hypothesis.
D1-923	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, orchestrated by plant life. This biochemical reaction converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This vital process sustains nearly all living organisms on Earth, serving as the primary source of energy for the biosphere. Photosynthesis occurs within specialized structures called chloroplasts, housing pigments such as chlorophyll that absorb sunlight. This process not only fuels life but also regulates our atmosphere by maintaining oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide concentration, ensuring the delicate balance necessary for life to thrive.
D1-924	We discuss the origin of two classes of germinal centers that have been observed during humoral immune responses: Some germinal centers develop very well and give rise to a large number of high affinity antibody producing plasma cells. Other germinal center reaction are very weak and the output production is practically absent. We propose an explanation for this nearly all-or-none behavior of germinal center reactions: The affinity of the seeder B-cells to the antigen is the critical parameter that determines the fate of the germinal center reaction. This hypothesis is verified in the framework of a space-time simulation of germinal center reactions.
D1-925	 In the vibrant, microscopic world within a drop of pond water, zooplankton thrive. These tiny aquatic organisms are critical to the ecosystem, serving as both prey and predator. From the minuscule rotifers, spinning their tiny, corkscrew-like tails, to the delicate, darting water fleas, zooplankton demonstrate intricate adaptations to their aquatic environment. Their delicate structures and swift movements belie the vital roles they play. They form the basis of the food chain, sustaining fish populations, and are in turn consumed by a multitude of aquatic creatures. Moreover, their carbon dioxide absorption contributes to the pond's carbon cycle, making them integral to its overall health. In this minuscule, aquatic kingdom, the importance of zooplankton cannot be overstated.
D1-926	1H RAMPS solid state NMR and 13C CP/MAS spectra of D- and L- alanine crystals were measured at temperature ranging from 220K to 295K. Some major points are as follows: (1)alpha-H and protons in the methyl group showed a spin-spin coupling effect as temperature went down in the 1H- MAS spectra of D-alanine. (2) In the 1H CRAMPS spectra, peak widths of alpha-H and beta-H showed a different trend between alanine enantiomers when temperature varied.(3) The dynamic behavior of 13C spectra showed an obvious change around 250K, which was supposed as a phase transition in alanine crystal. In the discussion section, we give these experimental phenomena a possible explanation related to chirality.
D1-927	 Nestled within the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, orchestrated by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. The dance of enzymes and molecules within chloroplasts, the photosynthesis hub, is a testament to nature's intricate design. Photosynthesis not only provides the energy that fuels most life on Earth but also regulates our atmosphere, maintaining the delicate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This process is a constant reminder of the symbiotic relationship that underlies the web of life, as organisms rely on each other to thrive in a world that is as interconnected as it is diverse.
D1-928	Many crucial biological processes operate with surprisingly small numbers of molecules, and there is renewed interest in analyzing the impact of noise associated with these small numbers. Twenty--five years ago, Berg and Purcell showed that bacterial chemotaxis, where a single celled organism must respond to small changes in concentration of chemicals outside the cell, is limited directly by molecule counting noise, and that aspects of the bacteria's behavioral and computational strategies must be chosen to minimize the effects of this noise. Here we revisit and generalize their arguments to estimate the physical limits to signaling processes within the cell, and argue that recent experiments are consistent with performance approaching these limits.
D1-929	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis emerges as a pivotal ballet, a symphony of carbon, water, and sunlight. Plants, algae, and some bacteria perform this dance, converting light energy into chemical energy. Through this process, they produce glucose, the primary energy source for most organisms, and oxygen, a vital component for respiration in virtually all aerobic life forms. Photosynthesis's grand scale contribution to our planet includes maintaining Earth's oxygen levels, serving as the primary food source for herbivores, and providing the foundation for the complex food webs that sustain countless species. This dance of life, a testament to nature's ingenuity, is essential for Earth's continued symphony of diversity and survival.
D1-930	We study the equilibrium behaviour of a deterministic four-state mutation-selection model as a model for the evolution of a population of nucleotide sequences in sequence space. The mutation model is the Kimura 3ST mutation scheme, and the selection scheme is assumed to be invariant under permutation of sites. Considering the evolution process both forward and backward in time, we use the ancestral distribution as the stationary state of the backward process to derive an expression for the mutational loss (as the difference between ancestral and population mean fitness), and we prove a maximum principle that determines the population mean fitness in mutation-selection balance.
D1-931	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, conducted by green plants and some bacteria, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. It's a testament to nature's ingenuity, a self-contained system that sustains life on Earth. Photosynthesis fuels the food chain, providing energy for all organisms, from the tiniest plankton to the grandeur of the redwood forest. Its efficiency, while seemingly simple, is a complex interplay of enzymes, pigments, and light reactions, ensuring the perpetual cycle of life.
D1-932	N2 association to the FeMo-cofactor of nitrogenase, including the recently identified central N ligand, has been investigated using first-principles electronic structure calculations. The oxidation state of the resting state of the cofactor and its electronic structure has been identified. A single proton is added to the sulfur bridges following each electron transfer to the cofactor. During N2 association, the cofactor undergoes large rearrangements resulting in opening the central Fe-cage of the cofactor. N2 binds axially while the bond of the bridging SH group breaks. It is then able to insert between the two Fe sites in a bridged configuration.
D1-933	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, a double helix structure carrying the blueprint of life. This genetic material, unique to each organism, dictates the development, function, and traits of all living beings. Within the DNA, genes are the functional units, encoding instructions for proteins, enzymes, and structural components essential for life processes. Genetic variation, the diversity in genes among individuals, arises from mutations, recombination during reproduction, and gene flow. This variation is fundamental to evolution, driving adaptations and species survival. The study of genetics, therefore, offers profound insights into the origin, diversity, and future of life on Earth.
D1-934	With the number of sequenced genomes now over one hundred, and the availability of rough functional annotations for a substantial proportion of their genes, it has become possible to study the statistics of gene content across genomes. Here I show that, for many high-level functional categories, the number of genes in the category scales as a power-law in the total number of genes in the genome. The occurrence of such scaling laws can be explained with a simple theoretical model, and this model suggests that the exponents of the observed scaling laws correspond to universal constants of the evolutionary process. I discuss some consequences of these scaling laws for our understanding of organism design.
D1-935	 In the intricate tapestry of life, microorganisms, particularly bacteria, play pivotal roles. These microscopic entities are the foundation of numerous ecosystems, from soil and water to the human body. Some bacteria, once deemed harmful, have been harnessed in biotechnology, such as in the production of antibiotics, biofuels, and enzymes. Others, like those in our gut, aid digestion, bolster immunity, and even influence brain development. Yet, while we understand their impacts, the full extent of bacterial diversity and function remains largely unexplored. This underscores the need for continued research, as the secrets hidden within these microscopic organisms could hold the key to addressing some of our most pressing global challenges, from antibiotic resistance to climate change.
D1-936	Most organisms grow according to simple laws, which in principle can be derived from energy conservation and scaling arguments, critically dependent on the relation between the metabolic rate B of energy flow and the organism mass m. Although this relation is generally recognized to be of the form B(m) = mp, the specific value of the exponent p is the object of an ongoing debate, with many mechanisms being postulated to support different predictions. We propose that multicellular tumor spheroids provide an ideal experimental model system for testing these allometric growth theories, especially under controlled conditions of malnourishment and applied mechanical stress.
D1-937	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. DNA, the familiar double helix, encodes these genes, shaping our physical traits and influencing our health. Each gene consists of a specific sequence of nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, and acts as a blueprint for protein synthesis. The human genome, containing approximately 20,000 genes, is a complex tapestry of instructions, each one playing a crucial role in our biology. Genetic variation, the diversity among these instructions, is a testament to our evolutionary history and holds keys to understanding diseases and traits. This understanding of genetics and its applications promise to revolutionize medicine and improve human health in the years to come.
D1-938	We investigate numerically and on the scaling level the adsorption of a charged colloid on an oppositely charged flexible membrane. We show that the long ranged character of the electrostatic interaction leads to a wrapping reentrance of the complex as the salt concentration is varied. The membrane wrapping depends on the size of the colloid and on the salt concentration and only for intermediate salt concentration and colloid sizes we find full wrapping. From the scaling model we derive simple relations for the phase boundaries between the different states of the complex, which agree well with the numerical minimization of the free energy.
D1-939	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, performed by plants and some microorganisms, harnesses sunlight's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process sustains life on Earth, providing the primary food source for most organisms and maintaining our atmosphere's oxygen levels. Photosynthesis is a testament to nature's ingenuity, converting light energy into chemical energy, fueling the web of life that supports our planet's diverse ecosystems.
D1-940	Allometric scaling is one of the most pervasive laws in biology. Its origin, however, is still a matter of dispute. Recent studies have established that maximum metabolic rate scales with an exponent larger than that found for basal metabolism. This unpredicted result sets a challenge that can decide which of the concurrent hypotheses is the correct theory. Here we show that both scaling laws can be deduced from a single network model. Besides the 3/4-law for basal metabolism, the model predicts that maximum metabolic rate scales as $M^{6/7}$, maximum heart rate as $M^{-1/7}$, and muscular capillary density as $M^{-1/7}$, in agreement with data.
D1-941	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find DNA, the blueprint of life. A double helix structure, DNA stores genetic information essential for an organism's growth and development. Each strand of DNA is composed of nucleotides, linked by a sugar-phosphate backbone. The unique sequence of these nucleotides - adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine - carries the genetic code. Genetic variation, the differences in DNA sequence among individuals, arises through mutations, recombination, and natural selection, shaping the diversity of life on Earth. This understanding of genetics has profound implications for medicine, agriculture, and our broader comprehension of biology.
D1-942	Spreading of bacteria in a highly advective, disordered environment is examined. Predictions of super-diffusive spreading for a simplified reaction-diffusion equation are tested. Concentration profiles display anomalous growth and super-diffusive spreading. A perturbation analysis yields a crossover time between diffusive and super-diffusive behavior. The time's dependence on the convection velocity and disorder is tested. Like the simplified equation, the full linear reaction-diffusion equation displays super-diffusive spreading perpendicular to the convection. However, for mean positive growth rates the full nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation produces symmetric spreading with a Fisher wavefront, whereas net negative growth rates cause an asymmetry, with a slower wavefront velocity perpendicular to the convection.
D1-943	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis stands as a vital symphony. This biochemical process, carried out by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, creates a harmonious exchange between carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. Through this union, energy is harnessed, and glucose, a fundamental carbohydrate, is synthesized. Oxygen, a crucial element for respiration, is also released into the atmosphere, mutually benefiting both flora and fauna. This cycle epitomizes nature's resilience and interconnectedness, a testament to the delicate balance that sustains life on our planet.
D1-944	Complex networks have attracted increasing interests in almost all disciplines of natural and social sciences. However, few efforts have been afforded in the field of chemical engineering. We present in this work an example of complex technological network, investigating the process flow of an ammonia plant (AP). We show that the AP network is a small-world network with scale-free distribution of degrees. Adopting Newman's maximum modularity algorithm for the detection of communities in complex networks, evident modular structures are identified in the AP network, which stem from the modular sections in chemical plants. In addition, we find that the resultant AP tree exhibits excellent allometric scaling.
D1-945	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene carries instructions for the production of a specific protein, serving as a blueprint for life. These proteins, in turn, perform various functions within cells, from building structures to catalyzing chemical reactions. Genes, like tiny code snippets, are arranged linearly along chromosomes, the thread-like structures within the nucleus of every cell. Genetic variation, the foundation of evolution, arises when these codes undergo alterations, such as mutations or recombination, creating differences that can ensure survival and adaptation in changing environments. Understanding this genetic code holds the key to deciphering the mysteries of life, from the tiniest microorganisms to the most complex organisms on Earth.
D1-946	A number of recent works have concentrated on a few statistical properties of complex networks, such as the clustering, the right-skewed degree distribution and the community, which are common to many real world networks. In this paper, we address the hierarchy property sharing among a large amount of networks. Based upon the eigenvector centrality (EC) measure, a method is proposed to reconstruct the hierarchical structure of a complex network. It is tested on the Santa Fe Institute collaboration network, whose structure is well known. We also apply it to a Mathematicians' collaboration network and the protein interaction network of Yeast. The method can detect significantly hierarchical structures in these networks.

This process, carried out by green plants, algae, and some bacteria, is essential for sustaining life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a remarkable example of biology's ingenuity, allowing organisms to generate their own food and release oxygen, an indispensable component for most forms of life. This symbiotic relationship between photosynthetic organisms and their surroundings contributes significantly to the planet's overall carbon cycle and oxygen content, making it a fundamental pillar of our biosphere.

To link this model with issues of interest in hadron radiotherapy, a simple physical model is used. Energy loss, its straggling, and the attenuation of the primary particle fluence are represented in a simplified way, based on semi-phenomenological formulas and energy-loss tables. An effective version of the radiobiological model is joined with the simple physical model to estimate cell survival along ions' penetration depth.

Chlorophyll, the green pigment housed within plant cells, is the maestro of this process, capturing sunlight and converting it into chemical energy through a series of steps. Carbon dioxide and water are the humble collaborators, transforming into glucose and oxygen, a testament to nature's cyclical harmony. This energy-rich glucose fuels plant growth, while the oxygen released nourishes the atmosphere, ensuring the survival of countless organisms.

D1-950	The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) has been used for simulating various biological phenomena such as differential adhesion, fruiting body formation of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, angiogenesis, cancer invasion, chondrogenesis in embryonic vertebrate limbs, and many others. In this paper, we derive continuous limit of discrete one dimensional CPM with the chemotactic interactions between cells in the form of a Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of the cell probability density function. This equation is then reduced to the classical macroscopic Keller-Segel model. In particular, all coefficients of the Keller-Segel model are obtained from parameters of the CPM. Theoretical results are verified numerically by comparing Monte Carlo simulations for the CPM with numerics for the Keller-Segel model.
D1-951	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, performed by plants and some microorganisms, transforms light energy, absorbed from the sun, into chemical energy. Water and carbon dioxide are the raw materials, converted into glucose and oxygen. This photosynthetic symphony not only fuels plant growth but also sustains life on Earth by replenishing the atmosphere with oxygen. Furthermore, it forms the base of the food chain, making photosynthesis a cornerstone of global ecosystems. This marvelous process, a testament to nature's ingenious design, is an ongoing testament to life's resilience and adaptability.
D1-952	Dynamical instrument limitations, such as finite detection bandwidth, do not simply add statistical errors to fluctuation measurements, but can create significant systematic biases that affect the measurement of steady-state properties. Such effects must be considered when calibrating ultra-sensitive force probes by analyzing the observed Brownian fluctuations. In this article, we present a novel method for extracting the true spring constant and diffusion coefficient of a harmonically confined Brownian particle that extends the standard equipartition and power spectrum techniques to account for video-image motion blur. These results are confirmed both numerically with a Brownian dynamics simulation, and experimentally with laser optical tweezers.
D1-953	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we uncover the intriguing phenomenon of epigenetics. This field reveals how external factors, such as environment and lifestyle, can influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. Methylation, a primary epigenetic mechanism, silences genes by attaching molecular tags to the DNA or its associated proteins. This modification, often triggered by factors like aging, stress, or diet, can impact traits ranging from behavior to disease susceptibility. Epigenetics offers a fresh perspective on how our choices and experiences can shape our genetic destiny. It's a fascinating intersection between nature and nurture, promising new avenues for prevention and treatment in medicine.
D1-954	Modularity is one of the most prominent properties of real-world complex networks. Here, we address the issue of module identification in two important classes of networks: bipartite networks and directed unipartite networks. Nodes in bipartite networks are divided into two non-overlapping sets, and the links must have one end node from each set. Directed unipartite networks only have one type of nodes, but links have an origin and an end. We show that directed unipartite networks can be conviniently represented as bipartite networks for module identification purposes. We report a novel approach especially suited for module detection in bipartite networks, and define a set of random networks that enable us to validate the new approach.
D1-955	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule at its core. This double helix, a structure of nucleotides, carries the blueprint of life. Each nucleotide is a building block, encoding specific information for protein synthesis. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic variations, shaping the diversity of species. Gene expression, the process where genetic information is translated into proteins, is finely regulated by a complex interplay of enzymes and regulatory molecules. Epigenetic modifications, another layer of regulation, can influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. This dynamic interplay of DNA, gene expression, and epigenetic modifications underlies the intricate choreography of life, driving evolution and adaption.
D1-956	"In a recent Letter [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 71, 432 (2002)], we reported a preliminary calculation and concluded that public exposure to mobile phones can be enhanced by microwave reflection in public spaces. In this paper, we confirm the significance of microwave reflection reported in our previous Letter by experimental and numerical studies. Furthermore, we show that ""hot spots"" often emerge in reflective areas, where the local exposure level is much higher than average. Such places include elevators, and we discuss other possible environments including trains, buses, cars, and airplanes. Our results indicate the risk of ""passive exposure"" to microwaves."
D1-957	 Delving into the intricate tapestry of life, we find ourselves captivated by the phenomena of bioluminescence. This enchanting display of light, emitted by certain living organisms, unfolds in a mesmerizing dance of chemical reactions. The primary players in this luminescent ballet are luciferin, a light-emitting molecule, and luciferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction. Upon interaction, a burst of energy is released, resulting in the emission of light, illuminating the ocean depths or the forest floor in a spectacle of nature's most captivating artistry. This radiant display serves various purposes, from attracting prey to deterring predators, providing another testament to the wonders and complexities of life's endless mysteries.
D1-958	A simple model of biological extinction with variable system size is presented that exhibits a power-law distribution of extinction event sizes. The model is a generalization of a model recently introduced by Newman (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B265, 1605 (1996). Both analytical and numerical analysis show that the exponent of the power-law distribution depends only marginally on the growth rate $g$ at which new species enter the system and is equal to the one of the original model in the limit $g\to\infty$. A critical growth rate $g_c$ can be found below which the system dies out. Under these model assumptions stable ecosystems can only exist if the regrowth of species is sufficiently fast.
D1-959	 In the intricate dance of cellular life, mitochondria stand as the unsung heroes. These dynamic organelles, engulfed within eukaryotic cells, are the powerhouses, responsible for generating energy through a process known as cellular respiration. Mitochondria's origins trace back to an ancient symbiotic relationship, a merger between a free-living bacteria and a host cell billions of years ago. Today, they maintain their distinct DNA, separate from the host's, a testament to their evolutionary past. Their critical role in energy production, apoptosis, and calcium homeostasis underscores their indispensable contribution to life. The study of mitochondria continues to unravel intriguing mysteries about our cells and our evolution.
D1-960	We demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish with a complete certainty between healthy subjects and patients with various dysfunctions of the cardiac nervous system by way of multiresolutional wavelet transform of RR intervals. We repeated the study of Thurner et al on different ensemble of subjects. We show that reconstructed series using a filter which discards wavelet coefficients related with higher scales enables one to classify individuals for which the method otherwise is inconclusive. We suggest a delimiting diagnostic value of the standard deviation of the filtered, reconstructed RR interval time series in the range of $\sim 0.035$ (for the above mentioned filter), below which individuals are at risk.
D1-961	 In the intricate web of life, photosynthesis emerges as a fundamental process, the green lung that sustains our planet. Plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and releasing oxygen - a process that fuels life on Earth and mitigates atmospheric carbon levels. This miraculous dance of chemistry, driven by chlorophyll and enzymes, not only supports the food chain but also purifies our environment, making it a crucial ally in the battle against climate change. Indeed, photosynthesis's profound impact on Earth's ecosystems underscores its indispensable role in the delicate balance of our planet's health.
D1-962	We present a so-called adaptive Ising model (AIM) to provide a unifying explanation for sensitivity and perfect adaptation in bacterial chemotactic signalling, based on coupling among receptor dimers. In an AIM, an external field, representing ligand binding, is randomly applied to a fraction of spins, representing the states of the receptor dimers, and there is a delayed negative feedback from the spin value on the local field. This model is solved in an adiabatic approach. If the feedback is slow and weak enough, as indeed in chemotactic signalling, the system evolves through quasi-equilibrium states and the ``magnetization'', representing the signal, always attenuates towards zero and is always sensitive to a subsequent stimulus.
D1-963	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the genetic blueprint of all life. This double-helix molecule, composed of nucleotides, carries the coded instructions for an organism's development and growth. Genes, segments of DNA, serve as functional units, controlling traits passed from parents to offspring. Mutations, changes in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic variations, sometimes resulting in advantageous traits that contribute to evolution. Gene expression, the process by which genes produce proteins, is regulated by a complex interplay of factors, including the environment, ultimately shaping an organism's characteristics and physiology. This fascinating realm of biology continues to unravel the mysteries of life and its evolution.
D1-964	The suitability of using the angular peak shape of the coherent backscattered light for estimating the light transport parameters of biological media has been investigated. Milk and methylene blue doped milk were used as tissue phantoms for the measurements carried out with a He-Ne laser (632.8nm). Results indicate that while the technique accurately estimates the transport length, it can determine the absorption coefficient only when the absorption is moderately high ($\alpha > 1 cm^{-1}$) for the long transport lengths typical of tissues. Further, the possibility of determining the anisotropy factor by estimating the single scattering contribution to the diffuse background is examined.
D1-965	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter DNA, the molecular blueprint of life. This double-helix structure, composed of nucleotides, encodes the instructions necessary for an organism's growth and development. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic variability, providing the raw material for evolution. These changes, though sometimes detrimental, can also result in beneficial traits, contributing to the diversity and resilience of species. Understanding DNA and its workings offers invaluable insights into heredity, disease, and the very essence of life itself.
D1-966	In this paper we treat some fractal and statistical features of the DNA sequences. First, a fractal record model of DNA sequence is proposed by mapping DNA sequences to integer sequences, followed by R/S analysis of the model and computation of the Hurst exponents. Second, we consider transition between the four kinds of bases within DNA. The transition matrix analysis of DNA sequences shows that some measures of complexity based on transition proportion matrix are of interest. We use some measures of complexity to distinguish exon and intron. Regarding the evolution, we find that for species of higher grade, the transition rate among the four kinds of bases goes further from the equilibrium.
D1-967	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene carries instructions for the production of a specific protein, influencing an organism's traits and functions. The human genome, containing around 20,000 genes, is an intricate blueprint of life. Genes are arranged linearly on 23 pairs of chromosomes, half inherited from each parent. Mutations, alterations in the gene sequence, can lead to genetic disorders, underscoring the gene's crucial role in health and development. DNA, the molecule of life, encodes these genes, with its double helix structure providing a secure storage system for genetic information. Understanding genetics opens new avenues for medical advancements, shedding light on the complex tapestry of life.
D1-968	This note provides a theorem showing, under suitable technical assumptions, that if a system S adapts to a class of external signals U, in the sense of egulation against disturbances or tracking signals in U, then S must ecessarily contain a subsystem which is capable of generating all the signals in U. It is not assumed that regulation is robust, nor is there a prior requirement for the system to be partitioned into separate plant and controller components. Instead, one assumes that a ``signal detection'' property holds. The result was motivated by questions of adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis, but the general mathematical principle is of wide applicability.
D1-969	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process, the green pulse of Earth. Plants, algae, and certain bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This miraculous feat, happening within chloroplasts, sustains virtually all life forms on our planet. It's a continuous dance of molecules, a testament to nature's ingenious design, and a stark reminder of our reliance on photosynthetic organisms.
D1-970	Many important cellular functions are implemented by protein complexes that act as sophisticated molecular machines of varying size and temporal stability. Here we demonstrate quantitatively that protein complexes in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are comprised of a core in which subunits are highly coexpressed, display the same deletion phenotype (essential or non-essential) and share identical functional classification and cellular localization. This core is surrounded by a functionally mixed group of proteins, which likely represent short-lived- or spurious attachments. The results allow us to define the deletion phenotype and cellular task of most known complexes, and to identify with high confidence the biochemical role of hundreds of proteins with yet unassigned functionality.
D1-971	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis, a cellular process, serves as the lifeblood of our biosphere. This biochemical miracle transpires within the green leafy tapestry of plants, algae, and certain bacteria. Harnessing sunlight's energy, these organisms convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, maintaining Earth's delicate carbon and oxygen cycles. Photosynthesis not only sustains the life of these primary producers but also feeds the entire food chain, ultimately supporting all life on our planet. This vital process, driven by chlorophyll-filled chloroplasts, symbolizes an extraordinary harmony between Earth, sun, and life, ensuring our planet's continuous bloom and survival.
D1-972	This paper presents a unified mathematical framework for inference in graphical models, building on the observation that graphical models are algebraic varieties.   From this geometric viewpoint, observations generated from a model are coordinates of a point in the variety, and the sum-product algorithm is an efficient tool for evaluating specific coordinates. The question addressed here is how the solutions to various inference problems depend on the model parameters. The proposed answer is expressed in terms of tropical algebraic geometry. A key role is played by the Newton polytope of a statistical model. Our results are applied to the hidden Markov model and to the general Markov model on a binary tree.
D1-973	 Nitrogen fixation, a vital biochemical process, is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3). This process is primarily facilitated by specific bacteria, such as Rhizobium and Azotobacter, or symbiotic relationships like those found in root nodules of leguminous plants. These microorganisms possess nitrogenase enzymes, which split N2 molecules, consuming prodigious amounts of energy to drive this reduction. The fixed nitrogen is then made available for plant growth, significantly enhancing agricultural productivity. Strangely enough, this life-sustaining process takes place under anaerobic conditions, as oxygen reacts with nitrogenase and inactivates it. Consequently, nitrogen-fixing bacteria have evolved various strategies to protect their nitrogenase from devastating oxygen exposure.
D1-974	We present a method for hierarchical clustering of data called {\it mutual information clustering} (MIC) algorithm. It uses mutual information (MI) as a similarity measure and exploits its grouping property: The MI between three objects $X, Y,$ and $Z$ is equal to the sum of the MI between $X$ and $Y$, plus the MI between $Z$ and the combined object $(XY)$. We use this both in the Shannon (probabilistic) version of information theory and in the Kolmogorov (algorithmic) version. We apply our method to the construction of phylogenetic trees from mitochondrial DNA sequences and to the output of independent components analysis (ICA) as illustrated with the ECG of a pregnant woman.
D1-975	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the DNA molecule, a double helix shaped like a twisted ladder. This biological marvel, composed of nucleotides, stores and transmits the instructions necessary for an organism's growth, development, and function. Each DNA strand is a sequence of these nucleotides, forming a unique genetic code for every individual. Moreover, within the DNA sequence lie genes, segments that code for specific proteins. These proteins, in turn, carry out various tasks essential for life, from building cells to regulating metabolic processes. Thus, understanding DNA and its role in genetics is key to unlocking the mysteries of life and potentially improving human health.
D1-976	We assume that the natural intelligence (human, particularly) is equivalent to a large inferring structure, which took shape in the last 400/500 million years. Then two hypotheses, about this structure and its development, are put forward for consideration. The first one concerns the transmission, from one generation to another, of the structure: we propose that this passage is done by direct transfer, mother to children, during pregnancy (maternal download). The second hypothesis regards the structure evolution: now the acquired improvements can be transferred to the descendants, so it is possible to envisage a governed evolutionary process (evolution by improvements).
D1-977	 In the intricate dance of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role. This biochemical process, carried out by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, harnesses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. It is a testament to nature's ingenuity, a constant, silent effort that sustains life on Earth. Each chloroplast, a tiny organelle within these organisms, is a minuscule factory, where the green pigment chlorophyll captures sunlight, catalyzing a series of complex chemical reactions. These reactions not only fuel the organism but also replenish the oxygen in our atmosphere, ensuring the survival of countless species, including ourselves. Photosynthesis, a symphony of light and chemistry, is a testament to the breathtaking beauty and efficiency of life's processes.
D1-978	F1-ATPase catalyses ATP hydrolysis and converts the cellular chemical energy into mechanical rotation. The hydrolysis reaction in F1-ATPase does not follow the widely believed Michaelis-Menten mechanism. Instead, the hydrolysis mechanism behaves in an ATP-dependent manner. We develop a model for enzyme kinetics and hydrolysis cooperativity of F1-ATPase which involves the binding-state changes to the coupling catalytic reactions. The quantitative analysis and modeling suggest the existence of complex cooperative hydrolysis between three different catalysis sites of F1-ATPase. This complexity may be taken into account to resolve the arguments on the bindingchange mechanism in F1-ATPase.
D1-979	 In the intricate tapestry of life, the phenomena of photosynthesis stands as a pivotal process. This biochemical reaction, performed by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Through this process, carbon dioxide and water are transformed, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This vital cycle not only sustains the existence of green flora but also underpins the survival of countless species on Earth, including humans, by maintaining the oxygen levels essential for respiration. The symbiotic interconnection of organisms through photosynthesis highlights the delicate balance and harmony inherent in our biosphere.
D1-980	Alternative splicing allows an organism to make different proteins in different cells at different times, all from the same gene. In a cell that uses alternative splicing, the total length of all the exons is much shorter than in a cell that encodes the same set of proteins without alternative splicing. This economical use of exons makes genes more stable during reproduction and development because a genome with a shorter exon length is more resistant to harmful mutations. Genomic stability may be the reason why higher vertebrates splice alternatively. For a broad class of alternatively spliced genes, a formula is given for the increase in their stability.
D1-981	 Delving into the intricate tapestry of life, biology unveils the wonders of photosynthesis - a dance between sunlight, chlorophyll, and carbon dioxide. Plants, the silent architects of our world, transform these elements into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process sustains life on Earth, serving as the primary source of energy for most organisms, while mitigating carbon dioxide levels, thus maintaining our planet's delicate balance. Photosynthesis, a testament to nature's ingenious design, underscores the interconnectedness of all living things, reminding us of our shared dependence on this vital process.
D1-982	The persistence of life requires populations to adapt at a rate commensurate with the dynamics of their environment. Successful populations that inhabit highly variable environments have evolved mechanisms to increase the likelihood of successful adaptation. We introduce a $64 \times 64$ matrix to quantify base-specific mutation potential, analyzing four different replicative systems, error-prone PCR, mouse antibodies, a nematode, and Drosophila. Mutational tendencies are correlated with the structural evolution of proteins. In systems under strong selective pressure, mutational biases are shown to favor the adaptive search of space, either by base mutation or by recombination. Such adaptability is discussed within the context of the genetic code at the levels of replication and codon usage.
D1-983	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the DNA molecule, a double helix structure that carries the blueprint of life. Each strand is composed of nucleotides, consisting of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base - adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine. The sequence of these bases along the DNA strand encodes the genetic information for an organism. During DNA replication, these bases pair up, ensuring the faithful copying of genetic material. This process, governed by the semi-conservative model, secures the continuity of life, passing traits from one generation to another.
D1-984	This article introduces the physics of information in the context of molecular biology and genomics. Entropy and information, the two central concepts of Shannon's theory of information and communication, are often confused with each other but play transparent roles when applied to statistical ensembles (i.e., identically prepared sets) of symbolic sequences. Such an approach can distinguish between entropy and information in genes, predict the secondary structure of ribozymes, and detect the covariation between residues in folded proteins. We also review applications to molecular sequence and structure analysis, and introduce new tools in the characterization of resistance mutations, and in drug design.
D1-985	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the humble DNA molecule, a double helix carrying the blueprint of life. This genetic code, a sequence of four nucleotides, dictates the synthesis of proteins, shaping the very fabric of our cells. The DNA's unique structure allows for the precise replication and repair needed for growth, development, and survival. Mutations, alterations in this sequence, can lead to genetic disorders or evolutionary adaptations, underscoring its profound impact on life. As we unravel the mysteries of DNA, we are also uncovering its potential as a tool for medicine, offering possibilities for gene therapy and personalized treatment. In essence, DNA, this twist of life, is the silent orchestrator of our existence.
D1-986	In this Letter, we extend the semiconservative quasispecies equations to incorporate imperfect DNA lesion repair. We study the equilibrium behavior of this model in the limit of infinite sequence length and population size, using a single-fitness-peak landscape for which the master genome can sustain a finite number of lesions and remain viable. We provide a full analytical treatment of the problem, providing a general mathematical framework as well as the full solution for a particular class of fitness landscapes. Stochastic simulations using finite sequence lengths and populations agree well with the analytical results. Applications to biological systems are briefly discussed.
D1-987	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find ourselves at the heart of DNA, the blueprint of life. DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the instructions for an organism's growth, development, and functioning. It's a long, twisted ladder-like structure, composed of four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, forming the basis for genetic diversity. Each organism's DNA is unique, a testament to the complexity and wonder of life's code. Mutations, alterations in the DNA sequence, can lead to genetic variations, driving evolution and adaptation over time. Understanding DNA and its workings unlocks a myriad of possibilities in medicine, agriculture, and technology, painting a vivid picture of the ongoing dance between nature and nurture, genetics and environment.
D1-988	We study evolutionary processes induced by spatio-temporal dynamics in prebiotic evolution. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that hypercycles emerge from complex interaction structures in multispecies systems. In this work we also find that `hypercycle hybrid' protects the hypercycle from its environment during the growth process. There is little selective advantage for one hypercycle to maintain coexistence with others. This brings the possibility of the outcompetition between hypercycles resulting in the negative effect on information diversity. To enrich the information in hypercycles, symbiosis with parasites is suggested. It is shown that symbiosis with parasites can play an important role in the prebiotic immunology.
D1-989	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis plays a pivotal role, bridging the solar and biological realms. Green plants, algae, and some bacteria harness sunlight's energy, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process, taking place in chloroplasts, is essential for the survival of most organisms on Earth. It not only fuels plant growth but also serves as the primary source of oxygen in our atmosphere, a vital component for aerobic organisms. Photosynthesis, therefore, is a cornerstone of life on Earth, underpinning the food chain and maintaining our planet's oxygen levels.
D1-990	Here we study the effects of many-body interactions on rate and mechanism in protein folding, using the results of molecular dynamics simulations on numerous coarse-grained C-alpha-model single-domain proteins. After adding three-body interactions explicitly as a perturbation to a Go-like Hamiltonian with native pair-wise interactions only, we have found 1) a significantly increased correlation with experimental phi-values and folding rates, 2) a stronger correlation of folding rate with contact order, matching the experimental range in rates when the fraction of three-body energy in the native state is ~ 20%, and 3) a considerably larger amount of 3-body energy present in Chymotripsin inhibitor than other proteins studied.
D1-991	 In the intricate tapestry of life, photosynthesis, a pivotal process, weaves its magic. This biochemical reaction, performed primarily by plants, algae, and certain bacteria, converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This transformation, essential for the survival of most organisms, is a testament to nature's ingenuity, enabling life to flourish while simultaneously oxygenating our atmosphere. The symbiotic relationship between photosynthesizers and consumers forms the bedrock of our planet's ecosystems, underscoring the profound interconnectedness of life on Earth.
D1-992	Intermittent density fluctuations of nucleotide molecules (adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine) along DNA sequences are studied in the framework of a hierarchical structure (HS) model originally proposed for the study of fully developed turbulence [She and Leque, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72}, 336 (1994)]. Large scale (10^3 < \ell < 10^5 bp) base density fluctuation is shown to satisfy the HS similarity. The derived values of a HS parameter $\beta$ from a large number of genome data (including Bacteria, Archaea, human chromosomes and viruses) characterize different biological properties such as strand symmetry, phylogenetic relations and horizontal gene transfer. It is suggested that the HS analysis offers a useful quantitative description for heterogeneity, sequence complexity and large scale structures of genomes.
D1-993	 Delving into cellular biology, we find ourselves engrossed in the intricate workings of the organelle known as the mitochondrion. Often dubbed the 'powerhouse of the cell', it is here that cellular respiration takes place, converting nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of life. Mitochondria's dual membrane system is a testament to its evolutionary history, hinting at its origins as free-living bacteria that were engulfed by another cell eons ago. This endosymbiotic relationship has proven to be mutually beneficial, enabling eukaryotic cells to perform complex metabolic processes while providing the mitochondria with a haven for survival. This fascinating organelle continues to captivate scientists, offering invaluable insights into the intricate dance of life at the cellular level.
D1-994	Exact numerical methods and stochastic simulation methods are developed to study the force stretching single RNA issue on the secondary structure level in equilibrium. By computing the force-extension curves on the constant force and the constant extension ensembles, we find the two independent methods agree with each other quite well. To show the precision of our methods in predicting unfolding experiments, the unfolding forces of different RNA molecules under different experimental conditions are calculated. We find that the ionic corrections on the RNA free energies alone might not account for the apparent differences between the theoretical calculations and the experimental data. an ionic correction to the persistent length of single-stranded RNA should be necessary.
D1-995	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, the DNA double helix serves as the blueprint of life. This hereditary material, composed of four nucleotide bases, adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, encodes the instructions necessary for an organism's growth and development. The human genome, a complete set of DNA, contains around 3 billion base pairs, housing approximately 20,000 genes. Each gene is a segment of DNA that provides instructions for the production of a specific protein, vital for various cellular functions. Understanding the complex dance between these genes and proteins offers insights into the workings of cells, the building blocks of life, and opens doors for potential treatments for genetic diseases.
D1-996	The spatial distribution of neuronal cells is an important requirement for achieving proper neuronal function in several parts of the nervous system of most animals. For instance, specific distribution of photoreceptors and related neuronal cells, particularly the ganglion cells, in mammal's retina is required in order to properly sample the projected scene. This work presents how two concepts from the areas of statistical mechanics and complex systems, namely the \emph{lacunarity} and the \emph{multiscale entropy} (i.e. the entropy calculated over progressively diffused representations of the cell mosaic), have allowed effective characterization of the spatial distribution of retinal cells.
D1-997	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we encounter the DNA molecule, a double helix of nucleotides. Each nucleotide, comprising a base, a sugar, and a phosphate group, meticulously pairs with another in a specific sequence, forming our unique genetic code. This code, carried in the chromosomes, dictates our traits, from eye color to susceptibility to diseases. Genetic variations, the slight differences in these sequences, can lead to the emergence of new species or contribute to human diversity. Understanding these variations is pivotal for medical research, potentially opening doors to personalized treatments and combating genetic disorders. Indeed, the DNA molecule, our genetic blueprint, offers a fascinating glimpse into the intricate web of life.
D1-998	We show that the protein-protein interaction networks can be surprisingly well described by a very simple evolution model of duplication and divergence. The model exhibits a remarkably rich behavior depending on a single parameter, the probability to retain a duplicated link during divergence. When this parameter is large, the network growth is not self-averaging and an average vertex degree increases algebraically. The lack of self-averaging results in a great diversity of networks grown out of the same initial condition. For small values of the link retention probability, the growth is self-averaging, the average degree increases very slowly or tends to a constant, and a degree distribution has a power-law tail.
D1-999	 Delving into the intricate world of genetics, we find the gene, a fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene carries a specific set of instructions, guiding the synthesis of proteins essential for our growth, development, and maintenance. DNA, the gene's carrier, is a double helix structure packed within the nucleus of our cells. The sequence of nitrogenous bases within DNA, adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, dictates the genetic code. Through a process called transcription, genes are copied into RNA molecules, which then guide protein synthesis during translation. This delicate dance of genes, DNA, RNA, and proteins weaves the complex tapestry of life, underpinning our very existence.
D1-1000	A great part of the effort in the study of coarse grained models of transcription networks is directed to the analysis of their dynamical features. In this letter, we consider the \emph{equilibrium} properties of such systems, showing that the logic backbone underlying all dynamic descriptions has the structure of a computational optimization problem. It involves variables, which correspond to gene expression levels, and constraints, which describe the effect of \emph{cis-}regulatory signal integration functions. In the simple paradigmatic case of Boolean variables and signal integration functions, we derive and discuss phase diagrams. Notably, the model exhibits a connectivity transition between a regime of simple, but uncertain, gene control, to a regime of complex combinatorial control.

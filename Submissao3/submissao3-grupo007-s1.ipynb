    "            AI; Obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, though it does not directly cause the disease. The connection between these conditions is so significant that healthcare professionals have coined the term diabesity to highlight that the majority of individuals with diabetes are obese or overweight demonstrates that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases linearly with rising body mass index. This explains why the worldwide increase in obesity prevalence has led to a corresponding surge in type 2 diabetes cases globally. The relationship works through several mechanisms: excess body fat, particularly visceral fat, affects insulin sensitivity and function. Some individuals with obesity can produce more insulin without overtaxing the pancreasy.\n",
    "            Human;The cell cycle, or cell-division cycle, is the sequential series of events that take place in a cell that causes it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the growth of the cell, duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) and some of its organelles, and subsequently the partitioning of its cytoplasm, chromosomes and other components into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotic cells (having a cell nucleus) including animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells, the cell cycle is divided into two main stages: interphase, and the M phase that includes mitosis and cytokinesis.\n",
    "            AI;A photon is a fundamental particle of light and other electromagnetic radiation. It has no mass, no electric charge, and always moves at the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s in a vacuum). Photons carry energy and momentum, which depend on their wavelength or frequency. Higher frequency photons (like X-rays) have more energy, while lower frequency photons (like radio waves) have less. Their energy is given by Planck’s equation:E = h f, where E is energy, h is Planck’s constant, and f is frequency.Photons behave as both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), meaning they can interfere, diffract, and be absorbed/emitted like particles. They are responsible for vision, photosynthesis, solar power, and many quantum phenomena.\n",
    "            Human;Photons, in many atomic models in physics, are particles which transmit light. In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy that depends on frequency: A photon associated with light at a higher frequency will have more energy (and be associated with light at a shorter wavelength).Photons have a rest mass of 0 (zero). However, Einstein's theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum. Before the photon got its name, Einstein revived the proposal that light is separate pieces of energy (particles). These particles came to be known as photons.\n",
    "            AI;\"The question of how life appeared on Earth is one of science’s greatest mysteries. While there is no definitive answer, scientists propose various theories based on evidence and hypotheses.VPrimordial Soup Theory: This idea suggests that life began in a \"\"soup\"\" of organic molecules in early Earth's oceans. Energy from lightning, volcanic activity, or UV radiation may have triggered chemical reactions, forming basic building blocks of life like amino acids and nucleotides. Experiments like the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment support this theory by showing that organic molecules can form under simulated early Earth conditions. Hydrothermal Vent Hypothesis: Some researchers believe life began near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where hot, mineral-rich water provided the energy and raw materials for life.\"\n",
    "            Human;\"We investigate the problem about the reason for the significant sub-centurial (50-55 and 60-65 yr) and quasi-centurial (120-130 yr) climatic oscillations. The 50-55 and 60-65 yr cycles are clearly detectable in numerous global and regional climatic parameters, i.e. in the temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere and World Ocean surface, in the tree rings widths, in the atmosphere concentration of CO2, etc. Searching for analogues of these cycles in the solar activity we study the connections between various types of solar, geophysical and climatic cycles. In this Paper I we analyze time series of residual variations of the Northern Hemisphere (AD 1610-1979) and World Ocean surface (AD 18561995) temperatures in respect to the corresponding regression models \"\"sunspot activity – temperature\"\".\"\n",
    "            Human;Aminopropyltransferases transfer aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structural and biochemical studies have been carried out with the human spermidine synthase, which is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor, and the Thermotoga maritima spermidine synthase, which prefers putrescine but is more tolerant of other substrates. Comparison of the structures of the human spermidine synthase with both substrates and products with the known structure of T. maritima spermidine synthase complexed to a multisubstrate analogue inhibitor and analysis of the properties of site-directed mutants provide a general mechanistic hypothesis for the aminopropyl transfer reaction. The studies also provide a structural basis for the specificity of the spermidine synthase subclass of the aminopropyltransferase family.\n",
    "            AI;Educational robotics has a wide range of applications aimed at enhancing learning experiences and developing essential skills in students. One of its primary uses is to teach STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) concepts, providing hands-on learning through building, programming, and interacting with robots. It encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. Robotics also supports the development of coding and computational thinking, as students learn to program robots to perform tasks and solve challenges. Furthermore, educational robotics promotes collaboration and teamwork, as many projects involve group work. In addition to its academic benefits, it can also be used to teach engineering principles, mechanical design, and mathematics in a practical, engaging way. Additionally, robotics fosters 21st-century skills like adaptability, perseverance, and communication.\n",
    "            AI;The use of insects for food represents a promising yet complex solution to address the growing need for sustainable food sources. Insects offer several advantages over traditional livestock, including lower resource requirements, such as land, water, and feed, and reduced environmental impact, emitting fewer greenhouse gases. They are rich in protein and essential nutrients, making them a healthy and potentially cost-effective alternative to conventional meat products. However, cultural perceptions and regulatory frameworks present significant barriers. Many Western societies are not accustomed to consuming insects, which may hinder widespread acceptance. Ensuring the safety and regulatory compliance of insect-based foods is also crucial. Additionally, developing efficient production and processing methods to scale up insect farming is essential for feasibility.\n",
    "            Human;Since the mid-20th century, active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life, encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and transmit communications. The concept of extraterrestrial life, particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, especially extraterrestrials in fiction. Science fiction has communicated scientific ideas, imagined a range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives on extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial life.\n",
